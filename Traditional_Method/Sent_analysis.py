X_train = ["When I first ordered my watch I wore it for a day and tried to charge it at the end of the day when I realized it wasn't charging past a certain %. I was instructed by Amazon to return it and theyd send another which arrived the next day. That was a month ago. I did, like many, get a rash with the silicone band. Easy fix, I bought a cheap nylon breathable one on Amazon and no more rashes and have washed the band and it dries super fast. Other than those above mentioned I love this watch! I feel the calories burned when I enter workout mode are very accurate! Also what some fail to understand is the calorie counter on the watch takes into account your resting basal metabolic rate as well as what you burn in exercise. So some may say I havent hardly done anything today and it says I burned 300 cals and I've been awake 2 hours but its calculating BMR too which is how many cals you burn doing nothing, just basic energy needed for the body to function. Mine is around 1600. You can calculate this number on your own with a formula but Fitbit does this for you with it's algorithms. I felt the sleep tracker is also pretty accurate. Amazon Alexa isn't too helpful, and you have to be near your phone to even use it so why not just use your phone. The weather app is convenient though. I don't use any of the apps other than it to be honest. I have yet to use any of the music ones because they require a premium membership (dumb and also why I'm not giving 5 stars). The battery life on it is great and it charges fast and I found reading texts and responding with the voice to text was very accurate (only available on android phones I believe).For someone trying to lose weight or just live a healthy, balanced lifestyle I find this watch helpful and helps motivate you. I liked the fitbit app as well. I may buy another for my husband if the price goes down! I attached a screenshot of the sleep and exercise from the app so you can see what this looks like. Click 'helpful' if you thought this was :)",
           "Been wearing a Sony Smartwatch 3 for a few years which has a larger screen and runs Wear OS.BUT, battery needs constant recharging, won't even last a full day so I started an extensive search for a new watch.With 53 Alexa devices currently in my home and office, Versa 2 caught my eye.After a full week of testing and use with the Versa 2 and tinkering with FitBit app on my Huawei P30 Pro, I discovered the following PROS and CONS:PROS*Bright screen and vivid colors*Endless choices for watch faces, some with very cute animations*Alexa feature successfully controlled my devices via voice commands to the Versa 2*Excellent battery lifeCONS*Using Fitbit pays forces you to have a lockscreen and that screen malfunctioned so many times, I repeatedly got locked out of the smartwatch and was only able unlock the watch using the app on my phone.*Pulse feature NEVER accurately measured my pulse*The Fitbit Android app is a major drain on smartphone batteries.*Getting to some of the settings is not as easy with FitBit OS and it is with Wear OS* You can only link ONE of your texting apps to the Versa 2*Charger design prevents using a protective cover on the watch that would guard all the sides. Thus, cover must be removed every time you want to charge the watch.",
           "The Versa 2 brings some modest improvements to the original, both inside and out. Here are some highlights:The screen is now AMOLED, yielding brighter colors and deeper blacks.The glass cover no longer has a bezel, giving it a smooth, low profile and premium look.The optical sensor on the bottom is bigger and doesn't protrude from the case, making it more comfortable on the wrist.The music and exercise buttons are gone. A mic to command Amazon Alexa is in their place. She can do things like set timers, alarms, reply to texts, give you the weather forecast as well as a FEW other useful things.The processor is faster. Apps load faster and the touch screen is more responsive.Always on display is now supported.Screen brightness is now always adaptive, though you can preset the base brightness.There is a new sleep mode which turns off autowake and notifications during during selected times so your watch doesn't bother you while you sleep. Do not disturb mode will silence calls and notifications during exercise as well.You can control the Spotify app on your phone from your watch.Fitbit pay is now standard on all Versa 2 editions.*The battery is rated for 5+ days. I've been getting a solid 6.5 with always connected, all day sync, 24 hour HR, and at least 3 hours of running.That being said, the Versa 2 isn't perfect. Fitbit OS is still feature lite, the app store is still rather small and there is still a dearth of useful clock faces. I'd still like to see a screen lock feature, a stride per minute counter and music controls in the exercise app, and a bunch of small. QoL improvements.If you're like me and mostly want an excellent fitness tracker with a handful of productivity features sprinkled on top, then the Versa 2 is for you, especially if you want a battery life long enough to make use of any of those things. If you care less about fitness and more about controlling your phone from your wrist, then you might want to look at a Galaxy Watch or a Fossil Gen 5, especially if you don't plan on tracking sleep, as you'll need to recharge both at the end of the day. If you have an iPhone I don't know why you're reading this.",
           "I've been a fitbit user for 5 years. Got the new Versa 2 to replace a Charge 2. The set up worked, you do need to set up the app on a compatible phone. It took some tweaking to get wifi to work. I'm still working out the bugs and figuring it out. Some things are not intuitive, like the settings short cut buttons. The fitness tracker is very comfortable. The band was easy to replace. It seems very accurate for step and sleep training. I picked this instead of the new Samsung watch active 2 because of cost, but mostly because I like the fitbit app better than Samsung health app. The smartwatch features still need to prove themselves. Im not thrilled with the watch face options, most of them you have to pay for, same for apps. Overall pleased so far, will try to update after wearing it longer.Update: fitbit app drains the battery on my phone to 20% before noon. If I don't have the phone connected to the watch, I can't use the notification features. No texts, emails, weather updates, alexa on my wrist. I still like the tracker, but it's frustrating to pay for features that i can't use.",

           "The charger for the Versa 2 will NOT sit flat on any surface as the wire comes out of the bottom. This is a downgrade from the original Versa charger which can sit flat.",
           "I have been looking for a smartwatch for awhile and decided I'd just buy them and try them out for myself. I was very hesitant on the Fitbit versa 2 because it's obviously more for fitness tracking than a smartwatch. I had this watch for all about a day and realized it was not worth $200. Here's why:1. The design of the Fitbit wasn't too big for my wrist but the straps didn't move so it was a little uncomfortable in that aspect.2. There is only one button so it makes it harder to control especially if you've been sweating and it takes a second to scroll to what you're looking for.3. This was the biggest issue for me. Yes there are apps like Spotify and Pandora but what they don't tell you is you need the premium subscription for it all. So not only do you need a subscription for Spotify add-on another few bucks to start it up. I honestly just thought Fitbit was trying to get more money out of everyone.There are other smartwatches out there that have Spotify.4. The Fitbit app on your phone wasn't very user friendly for connecting apps. It was very frustrating to use.5. Alexa sometimes doesn't hear you correctly. She's very limited on commands, which I already knew but I didn't think it would have been this annoying.6. At this point you should be able to at least voice text or send a already created greeting like you can on calls. Maybe you need premium for that but I didn't have it long enough to know.Don't get me wrong I might have just wanted more features which ik it's a fitness based watch but even for that I think it's outdated.I thought this could be the one but I'd rather pay a little more and get extra features like the Galaxy Active 2 (which is my next watch I'm going to try)."]

          "So kinda disappointed with the smart watch but honestly haven't been able to find anything remotely close to as good as my old Pebble 2+ heart.Pros:Color touch screenSome search abilities through AlexaWater proofPrice semi reasonable.Cons:Does not sink well to your phone and looses connection often.Can't text to someone in your contacts but can text back if they text first.Doesn't sink to work emailBattery only lasts a couple days.Only notifys of message or calls if phone is on vibrate or ring. This is one of the biggest cons for me as I'd use my watch in meetings to notify me while my phone being on silent.Also add the band gives my arm a rash.Currently, for the price it does not seem like there is a watch than can meet up to the Pebble 2+heart, but sadly pebble was bought up. If you're looking for a semi ok smart watch and really want a touch screen fitbit versa 2 seems to work ok. If you want it for exercising it may be helpful though I wasn't interested in that portion so don't use that capability much."]
