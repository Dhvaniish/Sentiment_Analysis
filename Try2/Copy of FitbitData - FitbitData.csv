1,"Pros:__________• It’s very comfortable. When you wear the Versa 2, the weight is balanced enough that it doesn’t bring any discomfort, and light enough to sometimes forget you have it on.• The design is almost identical to an Apple Watch. With square rounded corners, it’s almost impossible to tell the difference if you had both of them side by side.• I had no discomfort wearing this Fitbit when I slept and had no itchy feeling around my skin when I woke up. Overall, you can wear this all day without any issues.• The screen has great contrast, vivid colors, and has excellent brightness. On a clear sunny day, I put this display to the test and it passed with flying color. Outstanding outdoor viewability.• The Alexa feature does work. I did like the fact that with you can speak to this watch as if it was a smartphone, and Alexa will answer to you (in text). Weather report, nearby stores, and overall a quick way to get an answer (More details later on).• Fitbit is pushing this Versa 2 into the world of smartwatches, as you’re able to control any of your smart home devices with this watch. I only have some smart light bulbs, so my testing was turning them on and off with this Fitbit. Please to say that it worked flawlessly.• I felt the sleep scoring system was pretty accurate. I tested it for almost a week and the graph displaying for my sleep fit my experience. Fitbit always does a great job providing your data in a visually appealing look on the app and in desktop form.• The alarm feature is very useful. When the Versa 2 is tracking your sleep, it will find the best time to wake you up before you “actually” have to wake up. Everyone has a different sleep cycle (light and deep sleepers) so you may expect a different outcome. Usually, it’s within the 30-minute time frame before your alarm is set.• The other fitness programs in the Fitbit (activity trackers, heart rate, distance travel, calories burned, and so forth) are all decently accurate and effective. This technology isn’t new, but Fitbit does make fitness trackers that are consumer-friendly. You’ll be surprised how complex some tracker out there are. If you had the previous Versa, you should expect the same layout.• Some features like the Relax app (guides you through breathing exercises), movement reminders (lets you know when you been sitting for too long) and step counts all stimulated me to be more active. It’s hard to explain but when you see your progress on a graph, or even a number, you feel compelled to keep growing it. Because of Fitbit’s friendly visual graphs, you don’t have to write anything and overall it brings a form of motivation to keep increasing your numbers.• Numerous exercise modes, training guides, and even 10-minute training cycles. Like I mention before, if you need something to motivate you to work out, this will be it.• One of the best features in the Always-On-Display. I’m a huge fan of this because you’re not wearing the watch every second of your life. It’s nice to see that you can leave it on a table and the display will still viewable, like any other watch.• Third-party apps like Uber are available for this watch. I don’t use Uber, but it’s good to know that third-party app companies are putting their foot in Fitbit.• Going for a jog, the watch vibrates when I get a notification, which is just a text for me. It’s also pretty straight forward in deciding what you want to be notified about.• Yes, you can swim with it. Haven’t tested this out though.• Battery life is good, compared to the other smartwatches out there. Around 3 days of use before I need to charge it. Maybe 2 if I’m using it a lot, and the Always-On-Display is on max brightness.Cons and Oks:__________• There is a connectivity issue that I’m dealing with my Versa. It would disconnect from my phone and would take numerous times in trying to reconnect it. I have no idea why it’s doing this but I’ve noticed past reviews online addressing the same issue. It has to be a software problem because others are not getting this issue as well. Be on the lookout.• Another issue with the connectivity is you won’t know if there is no connection until you physically look at the display. This is a huge issue if you have notifications, texts, and updates coming from your phone to this watch. If the watch is disconnected, and your phone is not with you, you may miss some important stuff.• On the display, I felt Fitbit’s main icons are very unclear. What I liked about Android and Apple is that even if you never used there OS, you can tell where to go with the icons they provide you. The icons that Fitbit provide are very unclear and if you don’t use this device often you’re going to be lost in there OS.• You’re paying decent money for the device but Fitbit restricts a lot of it as they want you to sign up for their monthly “Premium” services. This monthly Fitbit service offers a great deal of programs, but if you don’t want to pay a monthly payment then you’re stuck with the “basic” software of the watch.• No idea why Fitbit did this but you can’t stream Spotify on this watch unless you have premium Spotify subscription. Not only that but you can’t even allow playback from this device to your speakers, phone, etc. I hope they fix this as it seems you need to pay more to use the watch fully.• Alexa provides the basics of communication but other than that I found it useless. The voice recognition lacks useful search results and since there are no built-in speakers, you’ll never get any audio notifications and hear Alexa’s answers. Middle of a workout, you will have to stop and look at the text that Alexa provides.• To even use Alexa, you need to install Amazon’s Alexa’s app on the phone and have an account with it.• No integration with Apple Health and Google fit. You have to stick with Fitbit all the way.• No GPS. You need to connect it to your phone to all GPS tracking. Without it, this creates a reduction in accuracy when you run. I didn’t find it to be that much off, but it’s enough that I think you should know.• Has some thick bezels around the screen.• If you want to change the strap, expect a fight. Fitbit locks the brands pretty solid, so taking them out ain't going to be fun.• I wish that you can customize the Always-on-display because currently, it’s a very simple layout. Not customizable to your choosing.• Currently I can’t respond to text messages with this watch with my iPhone, but you can use this feature on an Android.• I notice that Fitbit doesn’t have a payment system of their own. When you want to buy an app, you’re going to paying directly to the developer, where they can use any payment system they want. So far this isn’t an issue but it’s something to note in the long run due to security reasons.• You can’t even store your favorite apps for quick access.• Up 300 songs you can store on the desktop Fitbit app, but you have to transfer them over WIFI. No wire transfer and depending on your WIFI speed, it will take some time.• When you get a notification, or ask Alexa a question, you’re going to get a one-sentence answer. Numerous times I found this frustrating because you’re not getting any context to help you, and it just leads you to want more.• Your phone needs to be with you to fully use this watch. The Versa is an accessory to your phone.Bottom Line:__________It’s not a smartwatch for your phone. You have to get on board with this idea before you buy this watch. The point of Fitbit is to have a digital fitness book on you at all times. With the Versa 2, It’s a fitness book that does all the writing, tracking, and you’re only requirement is to workout. This is what Fitbit does a great job in. It provides you as much detail as you need on exercises, your workout routines, and your health. I felt the need to check on my stats every day as it’s one of the few devices that can visually show you that you’re improving. A light device, excellent display, and a great motivation tool.But you need to put it in your head, it’s not a smartwatch. The Apple Watch is a smartwatch. The Galaxy Watch is a smartwatch, and this isn’t. Unlike other smartwatches, once you buy this, you still need to pay more to have the full experience. Fitbit premium “monthly” services provide a great deal of data and programs to help you out, but you need to pay for it. Even with the payment you still need to have your phone around as Alexa currently isn’t useful enough other than asking for the weather. With no built-in GPS tracking, limited text/notification updates, and Spotify restriction, you can see why this isn’t in the same category with Apple and Samsung.This is a fitness tool to help you keep your body in shape. Fitbit does a great job in that, but if you’re looking for a smartwatch then go over to Apple and Samsung. Those are smartwatches, this isn’t.Overall: A virtual fitness book that is a must-have for those who want to get in shape but has too many issues to be called a real smartwatch.Hope I was a help to you.Love,Honest Reviewer",3
1,"The Versa 2 brings some modest improvements to the original, both inside and out. Here are some highlights:The screen is now AMOLED, yielding brighter colors and deeper blacks.The glass cover no longer has a bezel, giving it a smooth, low profile and premium look.The optical sensor on the bottom is bigger and doesn't protrude from the case, making it more comfortable on the wrist.The music and exercise buttons are gone. A mic to command Amazon Alexa is in their place. She can do things like set timers, alarms, reply to texts, give you the weather forecast as well as a FEW other useful things.The processor is faster. Apps load faster and the touch screen is more responsive.Always on display is now supported.Screen brightness is now always adaptive, though you can preset the base brightness.There is a new sleep mode which turns off autowake and notifications during during selected times so your watch doesn't bother you while you sleep. Do not disturb mode will silence calls and notifications during exercise as well.You can control the Spotify app on your phone from your watch.Fitbit pay is now standard on all Versa 2 editions.*The battery is rated for 5+ days. I've been getting a solid 6.5 with always connected, all day sync, 24 hour HR, and at least 3 hours of running.That being said, the Versa 2 isn't perfect. Fitbit OS is still feature lite, the app store is still rather small and there is still a dearth of useful clock faces. I'd still like to see a screen lock feature, a stride per minute counter and music controls in the exercise app, and a bunch of small. QoL improvements.If you're like me and mostly want an excellent fitness tracker with a handful of productivity features sprinkled on top, then the Versa 2 is for you, especially if you want a battery life long enough to make use of any of those things. If you care less about fitness and more about controlling your phone from your wrist, then you might want to look at a Galaxy Watch or a Fossil Gen 5, especially if you don't plan on tracking sleep, as you'll need to recharge both at the end of the day. If you have an iPhone I don't know why you're reading this.",4

 Another update before I return my watch for the second time: it’s 5:36am and my watch says that I slept 8 hours. I’ll upload the imagine. I went to bed at 11:15 and woke up at 5 am. I can’t believe how off the sleeping app is today.An update: my Sister got a new Fitbit versa for me again and I wore both Apple Watch and Fitbit Watch. The step count was very different. Almost 3 thousand more steps with the Fitbit. It counted extra 800 steps while I was in the resting position. Ones again I contacted the Fitbit asking them why this has happened, they told me Apple and other devices count steps differently. 2856 step difference is huge though.My wife just got her Fitbit Versa 2 yesterday and went swimming with it as it today. The watch initially worked for a few minutes while using the swimming app. After 20 minutes she came out and the watch was totally off. We tried to charge it everything but it seams that it got water fried. It’s supposed to be water resistant up to 50 meters! The pink band was bought separately. Original was purple. Had exactly same problem with last generation Versa. And from googling it seams that we are not alone with this problem. I returned my watch and asked Fitbit if they would give a discount if I buy a new watch they said they will not. Well I guess I’ll just save up extra and get an Apple Watch. Will definitely send all the videos I had made to the bloggers so others won’t make the same mistake.",1
0,"Imagine buying a smart watch that claims to have Spotify integration, and then Spotify just doesn't work. Right out of the box, one of the main features just gives you an error message each time you try to access it. And though you never get it working, it turns out that it doesn't actually have Spotify integration. You can just use your watch as a controller for Spotify on your phone. Which your earbuds already probably do.Now that I've spent some actual time using the Versa 2 to assist in my workouts, I'm going to deduct another star (previously I rated this a 2 star watch). During exercise the Versa 2 will frequently pause the music I'm listening to for some reason. The screen will be off and I'll be using the ""Weights"" exercise option, and maybe every 10 minutes or so the song I'm listening to will cut off mid set. So I finish and look at my Versa 2. Everything seems fine. It's still connected to the earbuds, it's still tracking my heart rate and time, but when I navigate to the music section, the song is paused.Sometimes during a workout, the Versa 2 will just restart. This has happened to me twice (Versa 2 had a near full battery since I charged it before heading to the gym). Basically I'll be exercising and my music will cut off, and I'll think I just need to hit the play button again, but when I look at the watch I just see the Fitbit logo. A few seconds pass, and then it starts back up. I have to reconnect my earbuds, my workout was cancelled so I had to start a new one.The more I use this watch, the more I dislike it.Welcome to the Versa 2.",1
1,"I just bought this and the app doesn’t work on either my iPhone or iPad. DON'T BUY unless you read the reviews on their app. Amazon gives me a month before I have to return it. I’m giving them 2 weeks to fix before I send back. I’ll let you know if they resolve this issue. Buyer BEWARE!As promised, the next day they fixed their app! Loving it so far. Had an Apple Watch and the battery last only a few years. Switch to the Versa 2 for half the price of an Apple Watch and as I can tell right now, features are similar. However, I never had Apple respond with trouble shot and a fix as quickly as the Fitbit Team!",4
0,"I pre-ordered this item and it arrived to me yesterday. This has been the most frustrating fitbit I've had. I cannot get it to sync correctly, it wont show my notifications, and I cant get my headphones to connect through bluetooth. And before all that it wouldn't download the software. I will probably be returning it, and hoping this one is just glitched. I really want to like this watch. But if I get another and it does the same thing, I may have to look into other smartwatch trackers.",1
1,"I've had various Fitbit products over the years, and have really liked them, and Fitbit customer service has been great to me. This is an upgrade from my Charge 2. The other watch I considered was the Apple 4 (or now 5), but it's twice the price at $399. The Apple had a EKG (really ECG) that I liked, but was not sure it would be too helpful for me. And the Fitbit has sleep tracking a feature that the Apple Watch does not come with. And the battery life on the Fitbit Versa 2 is a lot better with 4-5 days vs. Apple's less than one day (18 hours).The screen is beautiful, a HUGE upgrade. Lots of clock choices. There is an always on screen, but I chose to keep it off for now, it uses more power, and it's a very basic black and white, simple screen. And not sure I always want the screen on, there are times like in a theater or in a dark room where it would be distracting. A big plus is you can turn auto screen off at night, so it does not come one when you move in your sleep. A very useful feature, that should save some battery life too.I needed to call customer service as I was having problems getting it added on my Fitbit app. Since the watch is brand new (released September 15), it needs the latest Fitbit app for it to work. After that was fixed, there was a bluetooth issue, but after turning it off and on, we were in business.A wonderful upgrade for me.EDIT: I want to add, the watch bands are so much better than previous one's I've used on Fitbit watches. I'm guessing they are no different than those on the previous Versa, but they are so much easier to use than those on the Charge 2. (and I think they will last longer, I had problems with my Charge 2 bands breaking.)",5
1,"I previously had the Fitbit Versa Lite edition, which included features like Fitbit Pay among others. I have to say, I am overall very impressed with the Versa 2, as its features have vastly improved and the device itself runs much more smoothly all-around.Key highlights include:Much faster load time for apps and settings, as well as improved notification display time (from time received to time displayed).The display is MUCH clearer, brighter, and more vivid in color.The screen, although bigger than the last edition of the Versa, still seems a tad small proportionate to the device surface, however the actual glass itself seems much smoother and glossier.The silicone band (in bordeaux) seems much more comfortable and flexible, which will allow for more comfortable wear.The clock face that comes loaded onto the device is quite flattering; I likely won't be switching it out for another (and sifting through countless cheesy floral and wolf faces- sorrynotsorry).I absolutely LOVE having Amazon Alexa built-in, as I use this feature on all my other devices including several Amazon devices I have in my home.This brings me to my next point....We have a microphone, but where's the speaker? I was really hoping that Fitbit would catch up to other competing brands and install a waterproof speaker, not even for music playback, but for the Alexa integrated voice and possibly phone calls and notifications (yes, it's a fitness tracker, but even hardcore gym goers have kids with inquiries).This updated Versa is just about everything I hoped it would be. My favorite new feature is the accentuated screen size, and the new screen settings really make a huge difference in how I use it. Extended battery life is also a huge plus, although I would go 6 or 7 days without charging my Versa Lite, so I imagine this will last over a week now on minimal settings.Definitely worth the upgrade if you're considering!",4
1,"I love my Fitbit, BUT, beware of the band! I wear my watch so it doesn't move around. I went Swing Dancing and came home and took a shower and found what looked like chemical burns. I read all the information and this is a known problem! The band doesnt breathe and bacteria forms in minutes. The first is the burn from Saturday. The second was from a 20 minute dog walk and I cleaned my arm and the band immediately. Their fix... take it off. Well what did I spend 200.00 on to not wear it.The Fitbit is an amazing fitness device. I have used the Garmin and the Samsung and went back to the Fitbit. Just buy the breathable replacement band!",4
0,"I'm so disappointed by the Versa 2. You cannot stream Amazon Prime music on the versa 2. This makes the Versa 2 NOT worth it. You can listen to your free Pandora account but it will cost you for a $4.99 a month in order to have it on your Versa 2. OMG!!! Really? Again not worth it!! I bought the Versa to track my detailed sleep patterns mostly and come to find out if you want this done you will have to buy a premium upgrade for $12.99 a month. Nowhere in the description or on the box does it say you have to have a premium membership in order to have a detailed sleep summary . Again another falsely made claim by Versa 2. Lastly, I'm not able to download any music directly to my Versa to because it's unable to Bluetooth directly with my Mac that is 5 years old. It also does not Bluetooth to my LG 5 and I was told by customer service I need to upgrade my phone. You have got to be kidding me people? DO NOT buy the Versa product line as they are clearly not worth it!!After paying $199.00 plus a $15 warranty and then they want me to pay extra monthly charges and premium service fees to just to use the features it was suppose to come with? Makes it NOT worth it.",1
0,"Cannot figure out how to get ahold of the manufacturer. So I'll write my question and review here. Just got this watch yesterday. It will not recognize that I have downloaded the app. It will only sync with my phone half the time. And it will not update like it needs to, no matter if I'm on wifi or using cellular data.. I'm at a loss because I've tried to delete and re download the app, that didn't work. I forgot the watch on the Bluetooth settings and that didn't work.... Not sure what to do besides ask for a refund and purchase a different one!Update: the Fitbit finally updated once I put it right next to my router. and now it is constantly trying to resync itself, so I'm not getting my notifications sent to it from my phone..",1
0,"Been wearing a Sony Smartwatch 3 for a few years which has a larger screen and runs Wear OS.BUT, battery needs constant recharging, won't even last a full day so I started an extensive search for a new watch.With 53 Alexa devices currently in my home and office, Versa 2 caught my eye.After a full week of testing and use with the Versa 2 and tinkering with FitBit app on my Huawei P30 Pro, I discovered the following PROS and CONS:PROS*Bright screen and vivid colors*Endless choices for watch faces, some with very cute animations*Alexa feature successfully controlled my devices via voice commands to the Versa 2*Excellent battery lifeCONS*Using Fitbit pays forces you to have a lockscreen and that screen malfunctioned so many times, I repeatedly got locked out of the smartwatch and was only able unlock the watch using the app on my phone.*Pulse feature NEVER accurately measured my pulse*The Fitbit Android app is a major drain on smartphone batteries.*Getting to some of the settings is not as easy with FitBit OS and it is with Wear OS* You can only link ONE of your texting apps to the Versa 2*Charger design prevents using a protective cover on the watch that would guard all the sides. Thus, cover must be removed every time you want to charge the watch.",2
1,"When I first ordered my watch I wore it for a day and tried to charge it at the end of the day when I realized it wasn't charging past a certain %. I was instructed by Amazon to return it and theyd send another which arrived the next day. That was a month ago. I did, like many, get a rash with the silicone band. Easy fix, I bought a cheap nylon breathable one on Amazon and no more rashes and have washed the band and it dries super fast. Other than those above mentioned I love this watch! I feel the calories burned when I enter workout mode are very accurate! Also what some fail to understand is the calorie counter on the watch takes into account your resting basal metabolic rate as well as what you burn in exercise. So some may say I havent hardly done anything today and it says I burned 300 cals and I've been awake 2 hours but its calculating BMR too which is how many cals you burn doing nothing, just basic energy needed for the body to function. Mine is around 1600. You can calculate this number on your own with a formula but Fitbit does this for you with it's algorithms. I felt the sleep tracker is also pretty accurate. Amazon Alexa isn't too helpful, and you have to be near your phone to even use it so why not just use your phone. The weather app is convenient though. I don't use any of the apps other than it to be honest. I have yet to use any of the music ones because they require a premium membership (dumb and also why I'm not giving 5 stars). The battery life on it is great and it charges fast and I found reading texts and responding with the voice to text was very accurate (only available on android phones I believe).For someone trying to lose weight or just live a healthy, balanced lifestyle I find this watch helpful and helps motivate you. I liked the fitbit app as well. I may buy another for my husband if the price goes down! I attached a screenshot of the sleep and exercise from the app so you can see what this looks like. Click 'helpful' if you thought this was :)",4
1,"UPDATE (LOVE IT!):After a rocky first 24 hours with the Versa 2, things turned around. I love it! It has been working correctly since a day after the initial set-up. Don't know what caused all the issues or what fixed them. I did not change anything I set-up in the fitbit app or my android mobile device settings. Perhaps the problems were due to everyone trying to download/update their Fitbit apps and new Versa 2 after the release. So far any apps that allow push notification to my phone will also push to the Versa 2 if I enable them. I used the older fitbit connect app to transfer music from my Windows laptop to the Versa 2 -- no issues, lots of storage on the device for my music. I connected cheap Bluetooth earbuds with no problem as well. I can see my appointment from Outlook in the calendar app. It is awesome. On occasion, if I walk too far away from my phone, the Bluetooth disconnects, and I have to switch my Bluetooth on/off on my phone to reconnect, but that is mostly because I am too impatient to give it time to reconnect on its own. Alexa is fantastic - can use it just like echo and it works with all my other Alexa stuff. I should knock off one star for the complex set-up which does involve workarounds (for example, having to use the old fitbit connect app) and may be too difficult for some; but I love it so that I am giving it five stars.ORIGINAL REVIEW (The best when it works.):I upgraded my Charge 2 with the Versa 2. My Charge 2 worked perfectly - no syncing issues always stayed connected, and all my push notifications worked. I figured I would be safe from all these issues others have been reporting with their Fitbit devices of late. It took a few aggravating hours to get it to sync, update, and stay connected. I had to search the internet and apply all these ""fixes"" to make it work. They are not really ""fixes"" but rather workarounds, but I was ok with that as long as they worked. After much frustration, I finally got the Versa 2 working....for a few hours. And I must say that those few hours were utter bliss. The Versa 2 was AWESOME until it wasn't. Then the syncing and connections problems returned. I will give it a week or two to be consistent; otherwise, I will be returning it. Perhaps Fitbit is furiously working behind the scenes to fix these new issues and send out a real fix. I can only hope. I will post a revised review if the issues are fixed.",5
0,"Purchased the Fitbit Versa 2 because of all the hype and advertisements that I've received from Fitbit. Waited in anticipation and finally received it today. Upon setting it up, received a message that I could no longer use by Fitbit Ionic... Nowhere in any of the ads or on this page was it posted that you had to stop using your other Fitbit. Quite disappointed. It is already on the UPS truck back to Amazon. I didn't pay $200 to stop using my other $250 smartwatch.",1
1,"Very happy with this smart watch/fitness tracker. If you are looking for a fitness tracker that has incredible battery life, a fantastic app, and sleep tracking there is no better product on the market. I think it is nice that it also includes some of the essential smart watch features like messages on your wrist and connectivity to control Spotify. The Alexa integration is also a nice bonus feature. However, if you are more interested in a smart watch features and care less about fitness tracking then maybe the Apple Watch is a better choice for you. I actually have an Apple Watch and prefer to wear the Fitbit because I think Fitbit really nailed the features that are important to me - fitness, battery life, sleep tracking, messages on wrist. Everything else I can handle on my phone but it is nice that the features I care about are done so well on this watch. Also, it is really comfortable to wear. I never take it off. One other feature that I think is important is the always on heart rate monitor. The Apple Watch only measures your heart rate every 10 min when you are not in a workout. I like having the always on tracking during the day so I can quick glance at what my heart rate is doing. As far as I know, you can not do this with the Apple Watch; you would need to open up the heart rate app on the watch to get a read. Just another reason why I think this Fitbit is better for my lifestyle. It does the stuff I care about well rather than doing everything mediocre like the Apple Watch. Just my opinion...",5
1,"This is awesome. I love the accuracy of the sleep tracker, step counter, and heart rate monitor! As a former Charge 2 user, this thing is loaded with extra ""bells and whistles"", like Alexa built-in (SUPER CONVENIENT), ability to control Spotify/Pandora, cuts out the ""middle man"" i.e, your phone, when it comes to tracking water in-take, female calendar, as you can log all this info right from your wrist.Set your location in the app and get weather updates in just a swipe, upload your own personal music, pick from HUNDREDS of customized clock faces (even a Bitmoji one if you're a Snapchatter).Reply to calls and texts right from the device. Use/customize your own 5 responses with or without emojis, or, speak directly into your Versa 2 and watch your speech-to-text appear before your eyes on the screen, with the ability to edit before you send.All in all, for having this for only 2 days, I'm excited to put it to the test as far as exercising, personal tracking, and seeing how far battery life goes after 5+ days.If you're on the fence, just climb on over and buy this device! Fun, easy to use, and tons of replaceable bands to choose from to customize your everyday look!",5
0,"Update 9/30: It's going back today. The Alexa will not stay synced at all. I don't feel like I have a true Amazon Alexa device if you cannot stay connected OR even use your Amazon app or music on the watch. So back it goes. Besides, the watch will not stay connected to my phone at all. I will stick with my Apple Watch now.First off...there are are only two reasons for the three stars. The first reason is because being an Amazon Alexa based system added, it should allow that to do more with Alexa. It should allow Amazon Music app to be loaded onto the watch. It should allow Alexa to control calling and texting. I was disappointed that the Alexa on this is so limited. The second reason for the lower stars is because yes, it says a bigger screen size and it is flatter BUT that is deceiving. The screen is wider at first glance but there is a small square that scores the actual data. So that's why I decreased it by two stars.But all that being said....I still gave up an Apple Watch series 4 to have this FitBit back. I love that the health of the FB is more superior than the AW. I have always said that if the two got together and had a ""baby"" then they would have an awesome product worth twice what they both charge.I'm happy with mine and I will be keeping it.",1
1,"So I received this Fitbit on 02/29/20 and waited to write this review to see how it works for me. And here's what I've experienced..STEPS: the first 3 or 4 days the steps were off, like it counted more steps than what I actually walked. it was ridiculous. But then it seemed to get a lil more accurate as the days went on. I also tightened the band a lil bit so that it would be more secure. And I feel like now it DOES count more accurately. Now it does count steps if you just hit it or swing your arm, but if you don't do that too much while you're sitting or caring things, then it doesn't ""double"" count your steps. I'm happy now with that.SLEEP: It doesn't seem to track my sleep too well. Like it's not completely off, but its still not on point like I would like it.BATTERY: the battery life is pretty good. I can go about 3-5 days without having to charge it. I personally don't like having a low charge (like 34%) so I tend to charge it sooner than I probably need too. So it can probably go about a week without a charge.NOTIFICATIONS: my messages come thru immediately. I always get my messages as soon as they pop up on my phone. And in the app you can change what you want to come thru on the watch, like I kept my txt messages on to come thru, but not my phone calls, and I can change what I want to come thru at anytime.APP: the app is good. it's not super great, but it does what you need it to do for your watch. there is a premium option, and it does ask you to join, but you can say no and just use the app like normal. the premium just has more stuff to take advantage of, but I don't really care to use it (or pay for it). You can add or remove apps from your watch thru the app. you can even download new ones to have on it too. there are free ones, and ones you have to pay.CLOCK FACES: the watch faces are cute. there are LOTS of options. but I found out that there are a selected ones that are free and the rest you have to pay for. its just like the phone themes on androids. you have free ones and then ones to that you have to pay for. But they're all cute. I found a free one that I can put my own picture on to make it personalized. I like that a lot.I personally think that some of the reviews are from folks that have HIGH expectations of the watch, cuz I mean its not the Apple watch, so it is limited, but it does what a simple person needs it to do. For others, I think that maybe they just received faulty ones or they misuse it thinking its the watch.I'll try to remember to come back in about a month or so and review how it's going. But so far, it's going good and I don't have many complaints.Hope this helps !",5
0,"Do not buy the Versa 2! This device is unreliable, many user community reports confirm this and Fitbit will not back up their product warranty to refund your money when it doesn’t work.Details:I bought this Fitbit Versa 2 instead of the iWatch mainly because it’s supposed to track sleep and that feature isn’t available on iWatch yet and also because Versa 2 is less expensive, but paying less doesn’t matter if it doesn’t work. Did it work? Sort of - but only for a while. It sort of tracked sleep sometimes for a few weeks, but not always. Some nights it didn’t track at all and if you wake up for more than 20 minutes or so and then get back to sleep it stops tracking your sleep altogether. Sleep analytics without the premium features were interesting when they worked because theres some nice graphs showing how much time is spent in the different sleep phases. However, when I upgraded to the premium sleep features that you have to pay for the interesting data charts disappeared and the sleep features were actually worse. I also noticed that the Versa 2 double or triple counted my steps and I was getting to 10,000 steps on days I spent mostly at a desk. I checked the internet for Versa 2 user reports and found out that many users have the problem where the Versa 2 either over reports or under reports steps - which is the main feature of this watch. Then, the Versa 2 stopped tracking sleep all together - nothing. A few days later it also completely stopped synchronizing with the iphone app. I spent a couple of hours going through all the online community information to determine what to do.Many people in the Versa 2 user community had similar problems where their Versa 2 stopped working, stopped tracking sleep and/or stopped synching with the app. There are so many user reported problems that there are several professional product review sites that give a multi-step, multi-layer process for “fixing your Fitbit Versa when it stops working”. I tried the Versa 2 restart steps that the professional sites recommend trying first and that did nothing. Then I did what the professional sites say to do next if restart didn’t work - full Versa 2 factory reset. The Versa 2 data and app purchases are not backed up on the Fitbit cloud so the restart caused the Versa 2 to lose all data on the device and lose the app purchases I had made.I would be forced to go through the hassle and expense of repurchasing and reconfiguring the apps, and then when the Versa freezes up again I would have to go through the process again.At this point I decided to return the product for a refund because I don’t have time to deal with unreliable electronics that don’t work, lose my data, lose my purchases and take hours to simply keep running. I tried returning on Amazon but the Amazon site sent me to the Fitbit customer service website because I was outside the 30 day Amazon return window. When I called Fitbit they gave me a big, long runaround and wanted me to spend more time fussing with them to troubleshoot their Versa 2 device. They were able to observer their cloud logs for the device and they could see that it stopped working properly and that I had to resynchronize it, but that wasn’t enough and they wanted me to spend time over the phone troubleshooting why the device wasn’t working. I said they have clear evidence in their own logs the device doesn’t work properly, there are a ton of user problems reported on the internet, and I simply want to return it under their 1 year return policy.Fitbit refused to honor their warranty and give me a return slip. I asked to escalate and they said the would put me in the return escalation queue for an email response to my request, and apparently there are many people in front of me in that queue because they said it would be tomorrow or next week before they would send me an email, and it was unlikely the email would allow me to return.So now I’m stuck with a pretty expensive piece of electronic junk. I’m done with Fitbit and the Versa 2. I plan to wait until iWatch has sleep mode because iWatch is reliable and it does everything else the Versa 2 does plus more. If you want an exercise watch that is less than the iWatch, go with one of the others but not the Versa 2.",1
1,"I've been a fitbit user for 5 years. Got the new Versa 2 to replace a Charge 2. The set up worked, you do need to set up the app on a compatible phone. It took some tweaking to get wifi to work. I'm still working out the bugs and figuring it out. Some things are not intuitive, like the settings short cut buttons. The fitness tracker is very comfortable. The band was easy to replace. It seems very accurate for step and sleep training. I picked this instead of the new Samsung watch active 2 because of cost, but mostly because I like the fitbit app better than Samsung health app. The smartwatch features still need to prove themselves. Im not thrilled with the watch face options, most of them you have to pay for, same for apps. Overall pleased so far, will try to update after wearing it longer.Update: fitbit app drains the battery on my phone to 20% before noon. If I don't have the phone connected to the watch, I can't use the notification features. No texts, emails, weather updates, alexa on my wrist. I still like the tracker, but it's frustrating to pay for features that i can't use.",3
0,"It’s been a week and I am reading all the reviews carefully because I don’t buy gadgets often and am still undecided about this. My friends have the Versa 1 and highly recommended it. I was excited when I heard the 2 was coming out so decided to splurge as an early birthday present. I stop people who wear the Versa and ask them what they think- most everyone has been pleased.So far, I really like it. I haven’t worn a watch in over 10 years so splurging on an apple watch didn’t seem wise. I just couldn’t justify the expense and to be quite honest, don’t want to be that plugged in.I am a teacher and wanted to get text messages discretely while teaching and not have to check my phone- especially to hear from my own children. This feature works perfectly and consistently well.9/10 of the time, the watch displays the time when I glance down at it. Sometimes I need to press that left button to see the time. Would like for that to be more consistent but it usually works.Step count seems accurate- it’s an approximation- precision not needed for me to be informed and pleased with that feature.My biggest criticism is the docking station. The cord emerges from the bottom of the holder- making it impossible to rest on a flat surface. This is a huge design flaw and it’s hard for me to believe this passed testing or initial reviews. When I saw my friends Versa 1 charger, I was shocked they would change something that seemed so good in the first place.For now, I’m keeping it. The looks are impressive, the features work. I don’t need to call an Uber from my wrist. Its serves my needs and I’ll just hope they modify the docking station and offer a corrected product sooner rather than later. It really is a huge design flaw. Hopefully the features of the phone will allow me to forgot about that mistake. Excited to explore all that the app offers- including challenges and tracking.Addendum: updated to iOS 13 and sadly can no longer receive text messages which was the best feature for me. Sadly must process the return.",1
0,"I bought a Versa 2 a month ago. The heart rate monitor is often wrong, along with a few other functions. I've called customer service several times. After rebooting it and all the other unsucessful attempts to resolve, Fitbit just quit responding or gave me stock email responses. I'm trying to return this and go with another brand. Fitbit's customer service is a joke. I would strongly recommend buying a different brand.",1
1,"I absolutely Love this Watch! I had a Samsung Smart Watch, I sent it back . It's a very Nice watch if you want your phn on your wrist I guess and it's not a FitBit . Theres Nothing Like a Fitbit Versa 2 Love that I can Use Alexa !",5
1,"So I have a iPhone 8 Plus and expected trouble after reading several reviews. Shockingly I’ve had none. It connected right away, it syncs no issues, tracks things about as well as can be expected, it just does what it’s supposed to do. Overall I love this thing, it’s everything my charge 2 was and more. Tracking my bike routes, calorie count, no waterproof issues.. I guess if I had to pick something wrong with it I’d say it’s lack of decent face options?** updateStill no issues. The unprotected screen has taken some hits with absolutely no damage, the plastic around the screen has a few dings if you look for them. Band has caused my wrist to get irritate so I’ve taken to removing the bands and giving them a thorough scrub with some dawn and a brush to get in the books and crannys. I wipe the watch itself down with a cleaning wipe too. This has relieved the irritation so I do it about once a week. The thing is still awesome. The watch face options are pretty good but none of them have a working weather thingy even if they say it does so that stinks a bit. Battery life is great if you don’t use the always on display, I get a week out of a charge with it off and about 3 maybe 4 days with it on.",5
1,This watch will not connect to my laptop to transfer music. The windows app does not recognize the watch via bluetooth so the only option to have music is to pay for a subscription to a few garbage music apps and even then you cannot stream live. you need to download a song list through the service. After searching message boards all evening and talking to useless tech support personel I discovered the windows app is not compatible with the new versa 2. You need to download an additional application called fitbit connect. That app will help you do what you need to do.,3
0,The charger for the Versa 2 will NOT sit flat on any surface as the wire comes out of the bottom. This is a downgrade from the original Versa charger which can sit flat.,1
0,"I have been looking for a smartwatch for awhile and decided I'd just buy them and try them out for myself. I was very hesitant on the Fitbit versa 2 because it's obviously more for fitness tracking than a smartwatch. I had this watch for all about a day and realized it was not worth $200. Here's why:1. The design of the Fitbit wasn't too big for my wrist but the straps didn't move so it was a little uncomfortable in that aspect.2. There is only one button so it makes it harder to control especially if you've been sweating and it takes a second to scroll to what you're looking for.3. This was the biggest issue for me. Yes there are apps like Spotify and Pandora but what they don't tell you is you need the premium subscription for it all. So not only do you need a subscription for Spotify add-on another few bucks to start it up. I honestly just thought Fitbit was trying to get more money out of everyone.There are other smartwatches out there that have Spotify.4. The Fitbit app on your phone wasn't very user friendly for connecting apps. It was very frustrating to use.5. Alexa sometimes doesn't hear you correctly. She's very limited on commands, which I already knew but I didn't think it would have been this annoying.6. At this point you should be able to at least voice text or send a already created greeting like you can on calls. Maybe you need premium for that but I didn't have it long enough to know.Don't get me wrong I might have just wanted more features which ik it's a fitness based watch but even for that I think it's outdated.I thought this could be the one but I'd rather pay a little more and get extra features like the Galaxy Active 2 (which is my next watch I'm going to try).",2
0,"I received the watch today, it's beautiful. The band is incredibly soft, and the watch screen is vivid & crisp. My issues lie with the software, I knew I made a personally moral fault by buying a product for its initial release, oh well. First, I took a nice nap while wearing it - it didn't register my sleep, but it registered several intervals of sleep while my hand was idle & I was using my phone! Second, it will not download any animated clock faces (I have tried countless troubleshooting options, including connecting to several different WiFi networks), I continuously get a, ""Unable to install, try again later."" message. This is only the case with animated watch faces. Lastly, when scrolling through the settings menu, the watch locks itself. I have no idea why, but this happens every single time. Wait a couple of weeks for the bug updates, I will not be, though :(",2

1,"Love the watch. The size is perfect. The screen/resolution is crystal clear. The selection of bands is great (though changing bands is a bit challenging). The fabric band that comes with the Special Edition version is great. Classes it up a fit. Have also ordered a sport band to wear while playing soccer, swimming, etc. The device includes nearly all desired features needed for a fitness/smart watch. It does not have built-in GPS but rather uses connected GPS. Some may see this as a deal breaker; others will recognize the battery savings that this affords. And so far, the watch performance has been excellent.There are some reviews that describe Versa failure after getting it wet. I have successfully showered with the watch with no problem. I have not yet had a chance to try it in the pool. Based on the specs it should be fine, but time will tell. The Versa is not recommended to be worn in hot tubs.As Fitbit has long been a leader in activity tracking, I won’t spend time on those features. Compared to the Samsung watch that I’ve worn … step counting, heart rate info, calories and sleep tracking all seem to be in line with my historical measurements. A big benefit is that the Fitbit app is much more robust then the Samsung health app with significantly more data to analyze.The watch software and the battery consumption on both watch and linked phone need some attention. I’m still trying to determine the optimal settings to achieve a balance of desired performance versus battery life. With current settings, I can average about 3 days before needing to charge give or take a half day depending on usage. I’m currently using the always on display which is nice. It does consume some battery, but so far has not been too heavy of a drain to make the feature unusable.If you choose to use the music app to control music playing on the phone, then expect a massive battery hit. This functionality requires linking an additional bluetooth connection called Fitbit classic. It’s my experience that this connection continuously drains the battery on both the watch and the phone -- as much as 20% while sleeping. That is with the watch in sleep mode and the phone on do not disturb. I have removed this connection and will control music the old-fashioned way. Note that this applies ONLY to playing music on the phone and not to connecting to bluetooth earphones.Another setting offered in the Fitbit app is “All-Day Sync.” This feature constantly updates the data -- activity, heart rate, etc. -- from the watch to the phone. Sounds good, but it also is a battery hog and I have it disabled. As far as I know, syncing can be done one of two ways -- either via the all-day setting or manually when you open the app. I’m currently choosing to update manually. The developers need to add an option so the devices can be set to sync on a user-defined interval -- hourly, every six hours, daily, etc. A setting like this exists for nearly every other phone app that requires data to be synced. Weather apps are the first that come to mind.I am a Samsung user -- Galaxy S10 and Galaxy Buds (wireless earphones). I can tell you that the Galaxy Buds will not work with the Versa 2 watch (as of 11/26/2019). The Buds will link, but they will not play audio. Something to do with different types of bluetooth used in the devices. The issue is discussed in several online forums, but no word from Fitbit or Samsung if it will ever be addressed or fixed. The watch does pair to the S10 without issue and works perfectly well. All notifications are received timely and the bluetooth connection is much better/stronger than with my previous Samsung watch. It easily stays connected at 30-40 feet.There are a couple of issues that need to be addressed related to phone notifications on the watch. First, Gmail is the only client that is available as the ""default"" mail application. Or, at least it is in my Fitbit app. I can select to be notified by other email apps from my phone, but Gmail is the only app that can be set to receive ""special"" notification treatment according to the Fitbit app. Secondly, alarms on the phone (and I use quite a few) are NOT available to notify on the Versa. This feature would be a big plus to me. You can set 8 alarms on the Versa. However, each alarm uses some battery, and I would simply be duplicating alarms on multiple devices. For example, I would not remove an alarm from my phone as I may need it while the watch is charging or not being worn.To correct other reviews that I've seen, music CAN be uploaded and stored on the watch. The process requires using the desktop app and is a bit slow, but it works. IF I had wireless headphones that connected properly, then I could play music direct from the Versa without the phone.One other small issue is that weather info does not exist on the clock face by default. Third party clock faces can be installed, but I’ve found that they often require a separate setting for weather updates, which then only work if the All-Day Sync option is enabled. I’m continuing to search for alternatives to see what options exist.There are quite a few apps available for download and use on the watch. I haven't found any to be all that relevant or helpful to me. At least not yet. But the platform and functionality are there to use if desired.Also, I need to mention that the Alexa integration is great. We have a heavy investment in Echo devices in our household, so to have the same functionality on my wrist is a great bonus.If, like me, you are apple averse, then this is one of the best smart watches available that I have found. And very affordable. At this point, I would rate it 8 out of 10. And I would certainly increase that rating with continued additions to and improvement in the software, connectivity and watch features.**UPDATE 12/9/2019**Fitbit released a firmware update a few days ago which added some great features. The Versa now saves your 5 most recently used clock faces and you can change them on the fly without having to go to the app. Though there are tons of clock faces to choose from, one of the drawbacks with Fitbit is that you cannot flag, save or otherwise have access to your favorite faces. You have to keep a manual list of the names or just remember so that you can find them again. There needs to be a way to store a list of favorite faces and apps so that you can access and install them quickly.Other updates include that you can now customize the action of the side button, the sleep score is displayed on the watch, the list of exercises to choose from has expanded, and by reports the heart rate data has been improved.So I've learned that one of the tricks to manage battery life and connectivity is to restart the watch after making certain changes, such as switching to a new clock face. You may notice that the Versa stops sending notifications or is not syncing to the app. I've found that after a quick restart, the watch works perfectly again. Maybe it's a software glitch, but at least there is an easy workaround. And if you leave the watch alone, then these issues should not occur.For full functionality of the watch, including some features of many clock faces, I have re-enabled the All-Day Sync setting. The watch and app perform much better with the setting enabled. And unless I receive a ton of notifications or am constantly playing with the settings, I am now getting 4 to 5 days of battery life which is great. This could also very well have something to do with the recent software update. I am not currently using the always on display. I estimate that AOD cuts the battery life by 30 to 50 percent.Also, before you make a decision with the help of reading these spectacular reviews, you might gauge the quality of the reviews. This watch is by no means perfect and may not be the best choice for you, but you should decide that for yourself. Then return it if you're not satisfied. This is an electronic device and there can be duds. Some buyers have expressed frustration after receiving a device that was dead on arrival. Completely understandable.But there are many 1-star reviews that are not from a literate source. A two word review that reads ""hate it"" is not helpful. One review reads only ""no fitbit pay"" which is completely untrue. The Versa absolutely has Fitbit Pay. Also, I'm intrigued that apple phone users don't just pair their phone with an apple watch. Not sure why they are shocked that the Versa does not work as seamlessly for them as a product designed by their phone maker. Bottom line ... be your own judge.As referenced in my original review, I have updated my rating of the Versa 2 to a 9 out of 10, based on performance and recent software updates. Hopefully my positive experience will continue.",5
1,"Sleek beautiful design. I had the Fitbit Versa for 2 years and preordered the Versa 2 the day I got an email about it coming out! I can talk to text a reply back to someone or still use the preset texts or emojis. My Versa 2 works with my Echo dot & smart plug (I have a lamp i control and can now tell my watch to turn it off when I'm already in bed!) I LOVE the new Versa 2 and I'm so happy to see this upgrade. Although it doesnt have the feature to talk back, I think itd be nice for Alexa's responses for weather, updates etc.",5
0,"I'm 75. I consider myself computer literate but by no means computer-conversant. This watch comes in packaging which looks like the IPhone - very handsome. Open it up and...NO OWNER'S MANUAL! Instead, it directs you to go to the App store and install the Fitbit App. OK. Then the app asks you how you want to pay for the app. Huh? After $180 spent on the device, you have to spend another $80/year just to make the device work! They should give the device away - they'll make $$ selling the App! I think I've finally discovered how to pair the device with my IPhone - maybe. Otherwise, I'll have to talk to customer service to get the thing to work. :(",1
1,"I highly recommend the Versa 2. It has a highly customizable clock face and different apps to add to it. If you enjoy using Alexa it has it built-in and is easy to use. One of my favorite features is the text feature. You can read the whole text, mark it as read, and even reply with your voice! It takes your voice and converts it to a text. I have not had issues with the heart rate monitor not tracking my heart rate like other models in the past. The different work out tracking choices gives great stats on my workouts too. The more I use this the more I like it.**Update**After a number of months of use some problems have come up. My first Versa 2 had to be replaced after about a month. The microphone quit working. I do not take it in water or do any work that will bang it up. I sit at a desk most of the day. My new one worked for about two and a half months then the same thing happened. I am now on my third one. Fitbit is helpful and willing to replace the watches but it is getting old doing this every few months. Looking online it seems that I am not alone with this problem.",5
0,"The battery life is excellent. Best in class in fact. The hardware is nice, stylish, has a good touch screen, and the sensors all seem accurate.The software is horrible and this is a deal breaker. Starting with the watch UI:- when an activity is being auto tracked there's no indication of this on the watch so you won't know until after the activity is done if it managed to track it or not. Also you can't modify a previously tracked activity. You can only delete it and manually re-add all the details. (duration, distance, etc. Ugh)- the only thing you can do with the side button is Alexa or fitbit payment. Nothing else is programmable. Would have loved to use it for something else like quickly turning on do not disturb or something.- despite there being a microphone on the watch, no voice memos or voice recording support.- when doing workouts using the fitbit coach app - fitbit's own app - it doesn't show up on the watch. There's no integration. If they can't even integrate their own apps it's hard to believe anyone else will make apps for this.- syncing the watch on your phone requires location services to be on on your phone (Android). I know it's a new android flaw but they (fitbit) could have said this up front. If I'm not going for a run with GPS or using a map it doesnt make sense to have my location being shared with fitbit and Google.- the fitbit app is just full of ads to upgrade and buy other fitbit things. Core content is lacking. It's also a navigation nightmare. Nothing is in an intuitive place.- despite this being a device that contains your personal health information, you cannot protect your fitbit account with multifactor authentication.- you can't manually track basic things like a walk/hike from the watch. You have rely on auto tracking - which you don't know is working until your done and you sync with your phone. While you can manually start tracking more diverse activities from the app, if you start it from the app there's no visual feedback on the watch. So start a walk on the app and you can't check your watch for duration and distance. You have to pull out your phone. Like what...- you can only sync music using wifi. Not Bluetooth. I could also never get Spotify sync to work for some reason. And despite pandora being free to use on your phone to use it with the watch you have to buy pandora premium.- installing a new watch face is a process. The fitbit made ones arent great and there aren't many of them. And the third party ones require granting permissions which seems strange since it's only a watch face. Also it takes a couple of minutes just to download it to the watch which is strange because again, it's only a watch face.- notification sync is stupid. If you take your watch off you'll continue to get notifications on your phone AND watch so your watch will vibrate loudly despite not being on your wrist.- it will not give you a sleep score if you start the sleep tracker manually from the app. You have to let it auto track your sleep and theres no visual feedback to tell you that auto tracking is working. So cross your fingers and hope the next morning to see a sleep score.- auto sleep tracking seems okay at first but there's very very little supplemental info provided to back up the sleep score they give you. I can get a 60 one night and an 80 the next and I don't feel any different. Fitbit only provides a couple short blurbs about the numbers and doesn't go into the details. Because it's their own proprietary sleep tracking system you also can't just Google it for more info.- Fitbit advertise all over about the always on display but when you actually try to enable this they warn you that it will hurt your battery life. I end up not using it much.- The automatic screen wake works really poorly. Half the time it doesn't wake up and you have to double tap the screen to get it to wake (that tip btw was hard to find). And, if using always on display then you always have to either double tap the screen or hit the button to wake the watch which is really cumbersome.- one small hardware frustration. The charger is just perplexing. They made it so that the warch can sit in the charging cradle in either direction but it only has one set of charging pins so in fact it can only charge when attached in a specific direction - which you have pay close attention too. Pebble had a design like this as well but unlike fitbit they made it possible to charge in either direction to avoid confusion like this.- the charger also can't sit flat. There's no elegance to it like the apple watch charger. Its like they expect it to just sit pilled in a corner or soemthing.- vO2 sensor thing. Supposedly the hardware to check your blood oxygen level is in the watch already but the software isn't ready yet/waiting for FDA approval. Either way. There's been no communication from fitbit to consumers about when this will be available and without a published roadmap its hard to believe this feature will actually happen.They should have just waited and released the watch after getting ALL the big features completed and all the major bugs worked out.I wanted to like this. Hardware seems great, sleep tracking okay, battery life excellent. The software is just so poorly implemented though that it makes this device infuriating to use. Totally worth it at $100 bucks but not for $230+tax",2
1,"I am an Apple fan & was contemplating buying a new watch to replace my iWatch 2. The cost threw me! I checked out Fitbit and found the Versa 2. I love the size, the style, visibility of the stats I want to check on several times a day, the choice of faces and colors, the choices and prices of the bands, and I love the price! I use the clear protective case during the day and remove it when I go out. The bands are very easy to switch out. It is a beautiful watch with everything I need-alarms, timer, calories burned, date, heart rate, battery life steps, etc. I don’t like receiving and answering texts on my watch, since it is too hard for the caller to hear me and too hard to answer a text. For me this is a smart alternative for a smart watch. I am a new Fitbit fan!",5

0,"It's suCH a shame that we are in 2019 and fitbit can't get it together. This product sucks. Dont waste your time. I returned the first hoping it was defective but no, the software and product just sucks. Setup process is tedious, takes HOURS and it doesnt help that fitbit customer service aren't trained well enough to troubleshoot adequately. First rep told me to reset my router. Turns out I needed to hop on my 2gz speed as opposed to 5 because apparently the product isnt compatible on a speed higher than 2.5. Still can't figure out how to setup text messages. Cant see my steps unless i press button multiple times. Alexa functionality sucks because you cant control music through the alexa feature. I decided to ditch this and purchase a charge 3 instead. DONT WASTE YOUR MOnEY OR TIME. TRUST ME. Spotify and pandora only works for paid subscribers. Basically a gimmick to get you to subscribe.",1
0,"One only has to do an internet search for syncing issues to see fitbit has issues with syncing and android 10, especially if you have a Pixel phone. I had a charge 2 for years with zero issues. Immediately following the Android 10 update started having a lot of syncing issues. Most of the time it wouldn't find the device and would not update stats in the app automatically. It would require two things to resync - 1) I had to kill the fitbit app if it was running and 2) I would have to turn bluetooth on the phone off and then back on. Then it would sync for a bit and then wash, rinse, repeat back to not syncing. So I thought after a few years my charge 2 was dying. So I bought two Versa 2 watches, one as a gift. To my disappointment, it's the same issue. After searching the internet it's a huge known issue and fitbit doesn't even acknowledge it in the forums. IF they respond it's with a canned response pasted straight from a tech support handbook. Factory resetting the phone and the watch, reinstalling the app, etc... not of that makes a difference. Once I'm off work this week this is getting returned and will be someone else's problem. I won't be buying another fitbit after using them for years. Maybe I'll revisit them once the big G takes over and can fix the software issues that fitbit seems disinclined to do.",1
0,This watch is just a big source of aggravation. After just three days the battery was extremely low. They Supply you with this tiny short cord of about two feet two charged with and no wall charger to hook the cord into. Then the thing is very difficult to get in its cradle and to know if the contacts are touching. Trying to charge it and it doesn't say it's charging on the face. It doesn't monitor my sleep pattern at all. One night I went to sleep at midnight and got up at 5:30 a.m. and it slept said I slept for 1 hour and 45 minutes. What good is that? I probably am going to be returning this piece of junk.,1
1,"Three things to know:1. The battery life is fantastic. Smart watches with 18-hour battery life (eg. Apple Watch) have never appealed - who wants to recharge each day? My Versa 2 is doing 3-4 days between charges, no problem .. and I'm recharging it with 25% of battery left in the tank, so I'm sure 5 days is possible.2. It's light and slim. Not bulky, you're barely aware that you're wearing it. It doesn't get in the way when typing. (The main reason I stopped wearing watches in the 90s)3. You'll look at your phone less - and that's a good thing. How often do you check the time on the phone, see an alert and disappear down a rabbithole for 30 minutes... ?Oh, and if you track nutrition, logging food with it is much simpler than using an app. I use the Fit Logger Alexa Skill - https://www.amazon.com/entree-ai-Fit-Logger/dp/B081DQVHDL/ref=sr_1_20",5
1,"I have had this product for three weeks and I must say, I love it. I am not an Apple IPhone person and not that tech savvy. So for me personally I like the Fitbit for all that it offers. The sleep tracking, the fitness features, sleek design, and the battery life is why I wanted it. Also I had a Fitbit Alta a few years ago and this is by far better. Not too much in the realm of techy stuff. And just enough fitness items to make a really great addition to a beginner in health and fitness like myself. Maybe when I get rich and can afford 3 or 4 hundred dollars for just a watch I might consider an Apple watch. But I am just fine with my purchase.",5
0,"I made the mistake of buying this in mid-April after my cardiologist suggested it. The first 3 weeks it worked fine and I would give it 5 stars. It tracked everything it said it would, wasn't that bad to set up, had some nice additional features and available apps - I was very pleased with it.Then things go south. It stopped working for some unknown reason. After calling FitBit they sent a replacement - in a small, clear, plastic sandwich baggie in a crappy little brown USPS envelope with NO PADDING! No Protection whatsoever! (It was so laughable I took pictures). IT arrived BROKEN!That one wouldn't synch with the app. I can't tell you how many times I rebooted my phone, rebooted the FitBit, deleted and re-installed the App because I did them all so many times, to no avail. I have weeks of e-mails to Fitbit. They do not read the e-mails, so if you expect a real answer to any question be aware they won't READ anything you send. They will tell you to reboot the phone, reboot the Fitbit, re-install the app even when you've told them you've done this many times. They will direct you to their website which gives directions that don't apply (and they would know if they actually READ the e-mails). They will ask you what model phone you have after you've answered that question in 4 other e-mails (I'm so not exaggerating). it's a horrorshow.I gave up and asked the 3rd party seller for a refund (that is a whole other mess)....on day 31, and was told that I was 1 day over and it would not be refunded. Amazon refused. Fitbit is still insisting their broken replacement works when it doesn't. I've been fighting now for 6 weeks.Don't waste $230 like I did. BEWARE! Now my only alternative is the BBB and the Dept of Consumer Affairs. All I wanted was for the thing to work. That was too difficult a thing to ask.",1
0,"Fitbit, I just got the versa 2 when released! Sad to say but its a piece of junk, I can't get versa 2 and your own fitbit flyer headphones to stay connected!!!! I bought it to be able to play Pandora without carrying my phone when working out... this thing will not retain connection with your own headphones!!!! The headphones work just fine and stay connected ok with other devices so the problem here is versa 2!!!! Will be returning it as I bought it for that feature which is a total failure on your part!!!!",1
0,Recieved on a Friday. Had trouble getting the software to download. By mid-afternoon Saturday it stopped working. The screen went fuzzy green. Could barely read the clock. When I would push the button it would go fuzzy gray with a black line. I tried restarting per Fitbit's recommendation. That fixed it for about 5 minutes. Then it went back to the green screen. I have a replacement coming. Hopefully the new one will be better otherwise I will be purchasing a different brand.,1
1,"Disclaimer: I've since just bit the bullet and purchased an Apple Watch Series 6, as this product was sufficient for a while but did not ultimately suit my needs.The FitBit Versa 2 is a perfectly fine steps and activity counter and tracker. It is comfortable to wear all day and keeps a charge very well. In addition, the sleep tracking and heart rate tracking features are great. If you are in the market for a budget activity tracker, this is a great option for under $200. I purchased the Special Edition, which came with the woven band and also a silicone band. I actually stopped wearing the woven band, as it became uncomfortable rather fast. The silicone worked great.The issue with this device is that it does not display miles walked on the actual watch (you have to access the app for that) and also there are some serious issues with the tracking of calories burned/how many calories you should consume during the day. I'm 5'4"" and weigh 180 pounds, and I walk around 6-7 miles per day. Because of the weird algorithm within the FitBit system, it tells me that I should be consuming between 3,000-3,500 calories per day, as a result of my level of exercise. Walking 6-7 miles burns around 350-400 calories, which for someone of my height and weight (which I entered into my profile on the app) means that I should actually consume between 1,800-2,200 calories per day, once the exercise is factored in. My assumption is that there is some level of heart rate + steps + whatever variables that cause the astronomically high calorie level to be shown. This is a legitimate problem for someone who wants to use their fitness device to actually help them maintain or lose weight. FitBit would be better off removing that functionality from their devices until they can fix that bug. I have seen others complain about similar things, and I've even seen articles in tech magazines called ""Is Your FitBit Making You Fat?""The Display is nice looking; it looks very sleek and well constructed, and is bright. The phone pairing works nicely but without the ability to actually function as a true extension of the phone (texting/calls/etc, as with the Apple or Samsung watches) it's more of a novelty than anything else.I've had this device for four months and I've enjoyed it. It has helped me to get my body moving more, and it was affordable enough that I just bought my wife and I each one at the same time. That being said, now that I'm ready to really start using my fitness tracker to help me prepare for some significant hikes and runs, I needed something better. The Apple Watch Series 6 is miles ahead of this in terms of look, functionality, and true fitness tracking. The blood oxygen monitoring and sleep monitoring are very similar, which I give FitBit credit for. If you are willing to drop $500 instead of $200, I suggest going for the Apple Watch. If you are looking for something on a budget, this is perfectly acceptable. You will just need to fully and completely ignore the calorie tracking, and you'll need to access your phone app for information about the miles you've gone or flights you've accomplished.3/5",3

0,"THE FITBIT APP DOES NOT WORK ON WINDOWS PC, but they don't tell you that before you order. Had Fitbit Charge 2 previously and the app on my PC was very hard to deal with. After HOURS of trying to get it to work today, I finally called FitBit and was THEN informed that the VERSA 2 cannot be used with the Fitbit app on a Widows PC. Unfortunately I had already bought other bands and accessories for the Versa 2 and NOW HAVE TO RETURN THE VERSA AND EVERYTHING I bought to go with it. What a big big hassle! Makes me very angry! PATHETIC!! Thanks a lot, Fitbit.",1
1,"I use this in my every day life now that I own it, it helps me manage my phone calls and texts really well.As for the fitness aspect of it, it's decent, but lacking in a lot of aspects as well. The step tracking is nearly completely inaccurate: turning in my sleep after midnight counts steps for the next day, I can wake up with up to 200 steps already taken, and trust me, that's not sleepwalking. Not only that, but when I go through a particularly intense car ride (my coworker... loves to hit well over the speed limit sometimes. And in alaska, you get ice heaves in the road, which can make for a VERY bumpy ride.) I end up with my daily stairs count going up.The sleep tracking could be better, it's based on heart rate so you have to really go under for it to start tracking, which might mean a few minutes of sleep are shaved off as you get to homeostasis.The battery is exactly as advertised so far, it lasts about 3-4 days before I recharge it, and could probably go at least a little bit longer than that depending on use.My main complaint is Alexa: she's totally useless trapped in this tiny little watch. ""Set a timer for 10 minutes"" ""I'm afraid I can't do that Dave"" ""Why not"" ""Please stop screaming at me"" the conversations go on, but nothing ever gets done with Alexa, she's just kind of *there* for when you want to force it to shut off by pressing the button for a long time.TL;DR Good for recording a basic outline of how active you really are in your day, exercise and sleep tracking are decent but wonky and more inaccurate as you go on, and Alexa is useless go get an echo or something if you want a useful Alexa device.",4
1,"I haven’t been able to totally immerse myself in this product yet, as I just received it yesterday. The Versa has been my very favorite FitBit since it came out. I bought an Ionic when it came out but went right back to the Versa.THE *ONLY* real negative I see so far is this: The charger that comes with it is about a foot too short. That wouldn’t be a big deal since I had two chargers for my Versa. NOW we’re gettint to the real problem: THE CHARGERS MADE FOR THE VERSA ARE NOT NOT NOT(!) COMPATIBLE WITH THE VERSA 2! I keep looking for compatible chargers with longer cords but am turned off by the fact they all say they’re compatible. I saw it first hand. The Versa 2 is just slightly wider- just slightly, mind you. But enough to make charging using my Versa chargers IMPOSSIBLE. It’s soooo bizarre- like a conspiracy. They’re trying to tell us they’re compatible, but they’re clearly not.Fitbit, Inc: PLEASE QUIT PEEING ON MY HEAD ONLY TO TELL ME IT’S RAINING WHEN I REACT. The Versa 2 does not work with the regular Versa charger. It’s too wide. Please scramble together, pull an all nighter and figure out how to calmly explain you were wrong - and attach a longer cord to one and call it an accessory. I don’t care if I have to buy it separately - just MAKE IT and advertise it for “VERSA 2”. I don’t doubt that the regular Versa might work on the Versa 2’s charger- but it DOES NOT work the other way around.",4
0,"The audio controls are kind of embarrassing. Unless you use Spotify or Pandora, and install their watch-specific apps, you need to find the setting in bluetooth to pair your phone and use the watch as generic bluetooth controls. Why isn't this the default behavior if all-day sync is enabled?Why does it take two interactions do do anything on the watch if the always-on display is enabled?Why bother having watchfaces at all if the always-on display watchface only has 2 options, digital or analog?It seems like if I want my $200 smartwatch to act like a watch, it takes an extra step before I can utilize any ""smart"" features.Fortunately, the default installed watch apps seem pretty easy to uninstall to declutter the menus. I also really appreciate the ability to disable the microphone outright in settings. Using standardized watch bands is nice too, but I haven't even gotten to test the battery life and I'm already considering returning this and trying to find a Pebble Time Steel before they get any rarer.In my opinion, the versa 2 needs to be less Apple watch, more Pebble Time. The Versa 2 tries too hard to be a smartphone on your wrist, instead of an intelligent smartphone accessory that adds to your smartphone experience.Edit: after less than a week I experienced an issue where the watch stopped syncing, and then got caught in a loop when I attempted a factory reset to address the syncing. I was eventually able to complete a reset after some fiddling, just in time to pack it back in the box. I'll be returning this item.",1
0,This is a piece of JUNK! Idk how Fitbit is even a “name” in fitness tracking. I’ve owned this watch a week. It tracked my sleep for only 2 nights. After getting on some Fitbit forums and learning EVERYONE has these issues- I was a little surprised. Fitbit refuses to acknowledge that is product DOESNT do what it claims it does.Not tracking sleep was only my 1st problem. The second is not tracking steps OR tracking an accurate heart rate! What’s the point of wearing this piece of s*** on my wrist for? And the final straw??... it won’t charge now. Yup. Won’t even charge!And YES!..I went through ALL the resets and troubleshooting with Fitbit. ALL of their automated responses helped NOTHING and were actually quiet insulting by telling me to do the same stupid resets over and over. Doing nothing but adding frustration and wasting my time. Let me remind you I have only owned this watch a WEEK. 1 week! I will never recommend Fitbit to anyone serious about tracking... well ANYTHING! 0 stars!! Don’t even bother with it and save yourself the $$ and headache! And you know.. buyers remorse because I definitely have that now!,1
1,"Freaked out today for 2.5 hours. Versa 2 delivered Oct 30th 2019 (via Amazon). Today is Nov 12th. Not responsive and cell phone software repeatedly tried to communicate with Fitbit device. When I held side button for 5+ seconds, 2 white horizontal lines would scroll up. Occasionally, I would see flickers of the screen, though faded out and half illegible. After 2.5 hours, it started working again. I lost all data during that time frame. I place it on the charger every night, since I purchased it. Tonight, it only had a 53% charge. At this time, I cannot recommend this phone.Update: Though the Fitbit website, I found the support number and called. After verification, they are sending me a replacement watch.",3
0,"I had a Fitbit blaze for 3 years, and loved it. Prior to that I had another Fitbit product. I read the reviews, and bought this versa when my Blaze died. I regret it.I don’t use the watch as an Alexa, to listen to music, or receive text. It is for me a fancy sleep and pedometer. Both these functions no longer live up to my expectations.Sleep- I went to bed around midnight last night. I looked this morning, the Versa recorded 5 am as my start of sleep. Complete fail. I went to a CrossFit class Monday and Wednesday. According to the new Fitbit, Monday was 18 minutes of workout, and Wednesday 0 minutes. When I tried to find my heart rate in the app during my workout, I couldn’t find It. I’m not sure if this was my error or moved to the monthly subscription. It all makes me question all the statistics.I do like the look of the Versa and the screen options. I have the watch connected to my iPad. I also have the app on my Samsung 9 note phone.I will probably by a Garmin this month. :( I miss my Blaze.",2
0,I bought this so I'd have a way to listen to music while out trail running in place of carrying my phone (or strapping it to my arm) . That I can do so I gave this one star. Since I had it I thought I would try out the other features. It doesn't accurately measure calories burned. It displays the same amout whether I walk all 8000 steps or if 5000 of those are running up a mountain. I've only been able to successfully update it once and I had to unpair my wireless headphones and restart the device several times to get it to connect. I put it in its base and plug into a laptop so there shouldn't be an issue. I've only gotten error messages since while trying to update. It will sometimes go several days without displaying sleep data. I have no idea why. You can't wear it in the shower. I should have just bought a cheap clip on mp3 player.,1
0,"First the issue with heart rate tracking accuracy - I've owned a charge 2 and a ionic in past and when I lost ionic I decided to give this a try rather than buying another ionic. In comparison to past devices the heart rate accuracy during sleep and during workout has been much worse. Almost every if not every workout the heart rate reads much lower than actual. I live in a high rise and one of my workout is to repeatedly go up 20+ floors of stairs and very frequently it happens that I can feel my heart beating at high cardio range (155+ bpm) and the tracker only show between 90 - 96 bpm. Often times during sleep I also get less detailed sleep information because tracker fails to detect heart rate for large stretch of time during night.The accuracy issue by itself would have made me give this a 3 out of 5 rating until the device started to lose brightness about two months ago, even with setting at maximum brightness display was getting to dim to read in the outdoor. And now about a week ago the device completely died and the screen is not coming on at all even with the charger plugged in. Going to talk to Fitbit support and will post the update here depending on outcome.",1
1,"I've had it 3 days. Connect with wifi took forever. Initial software update took 30 minutes. I mainly use the heartbeat, weather and sleep reports. Once in a while it does not recognize my heartbeat. I have compared the displayed heartbeat with other calculations, it seems to be okay. I've compared using fingers on my wrist and compared with my PB device. The weather report is very good. I have no idea whether the sleep report is accurate. The steps display does not always update promptly. The screen display is outstanding. It is readable even in my car. The fitbit pay (one of the reasons I chose this device) could not be better. I used it twice, once at my ATM and once at retail. Seemed to me like an instant connect. This works better than Google Pay on my phone, which is clumsy to use and does not always connect. My primary bank does not partner with fitbit pay. In my opinion few banks do. Some suggestions: add a tap on the face to wake up the watch face. This would be in addition to the physical button and the wrist movement. When in church, I would like to take a subtle peak sometimes. I would like to be able to swipe out of the apps instead of using the physical button. Notifications to the phone are delayed, sometimes a little, sometimes a lot. If possible add Google Pay to the NFC functions. Lots of banks are already set up to GP. Battery use so far seems to be 20% per day. After I finish playing with it, maybe that will improve a little.",3
0,"I loved the watch, but with being a runner and needing a fittness watch that can track my runs I am very disappointed in this. I understand it only has the connected GPS, I had the Ionic before this watch. But that shouldn't make that big of a difference. I run at a minimum a set amount every other day of 1.59 miles. This was tracking about 1/4 of a mile less to 1/4 of a mile more. Which is crazy. I ran a 10k and it tracked me at running 6.69 miles which a 10k is 6. 2 miles. After talking to fitbit about this they could not give me a reason for this or how to fix it. I was just told that there tech team would look into it and get back to me when they figure it out. After having the watch for 2 weeks with this issue it was a deal breaker. Don't get this watch if you are a runner. For everything eles it worked great.",2
1,"Like many, I've been a Fitbit user for a very long time. Cycling through almost every new Fitness Tracker they came out with. My most recent of these being the Versa 2, it's comfortable and sleek looking.There are many things I really LOVE about this watch, but I'm beginning to wonder if maybe Fitbit is not putting enough quality into their products, and I'll tell you why below. However, I would love to share what I like about the watch, and some features that I use almost daily.Features I love, and use often:- I never realized how much I would use this feature, but I find it so very useful: The timer option. I don't use it for laps, or anything of that nature as you have that built into the exercise feature. However, I do use this to time my son's reading for homework. Grilling outside. Reminders of letting my animals back inside after being let out. And for so much more, I truly utilize this function on an almost daily basis. Such a great feature.- The exercise button. You can customize which exercise buttons are quick access, via the Fitbit App. This is useful because I do most of the same type of exercises on a regular basis, and this makes it easy. The one downfall here is that if you chose to activate the GPS option for a more accurate distance calculation you MUST have the app open on your phone. I don't love that, as I would think it should calculate it based off your phones location, but I'm no engineer.- Sleep Score & Cycle Tracker - I like to take a look at my sleep score over time, as I tend to not sleep a lot. I have a toddler and wake up at early hours each day to fit the needs of my family, and maintain my full time career. It helps me understand why I may be more tired on some days vs others. And each person needs a certain range of sleep, I try to stay within those parameters, but often my toddler disrupts my sleep cycles. It's been pretty accurate, any time I've tested it against what I have recorded manually. And I love the Cycle Tracker as a female. I have PCOS so my cycles have always wee bit wonky. This helps me track them, know when to expect them, and edit my information to have the most accurate account of each cycle. You can input your details about mood, flow, etc.With that said, I have noticed a few downfalls regarding this (and other) newer models: I go through about 1 a year. I am not the most kind to anything regarding accessories, so I understand I can be rough on them. But I do take care of my watch. I wash it, dry it, keep a screen protector on it. I don't shower with it, and charge it as often as I need. But I've had watches just stop working, the HR function quit, and all this within 1 year of purchase. Yes, Fitbit does have great customer service, and often without question they will send a replacement. However, I just feel like they're pushing out models constantly vs trying to really fix the problems.Like other reviewers, I've faced connectivity issues. Sometimes my watch just won't sync, then it won't record, and the app isn't updated. When exercising I've had the watch not pull GPS because it says it cannot connect, but I've done everything I can to troubleshoot. The Alexa function doesn't work for either of the two Versa 2's I've had. I've enabled it, and had it close to my phone; but it doesn't work.I really love the look of this Versa 2. With the one button on the side, to assist with maneuvering through the watch. I love the Customization features of this watch through the app, it's great. Fitbit really has something there, the app is so user friendly. However, I wish they would make a watch that lasted longer. And I know they're not Apple Watch price tags, but they're close enough. My MIL has the same problems as I, and she's not nearly as harsh on hers as I am. At this point, I'm looking into a different brand, just to see how I like it because my current Versa 2 (a replacement from the first one) is losing the seals around the bottom of the unit and I fear it will quit being water resistant.I would recommend this watch, absolutely. Especially for a beginner in this market, and for someone whom likes to track their daily movement. But maybe something a little more rugged for those that aren't so easy on our accessories.",4
0,"My main purpose in buying this device was to be able to listen to music during workouts. I had a generally hard time setting up the device, received help from customer service, but was utterly stumped on connecting to Spotify. On the fourth call to customer service, the employee apologetically explained that the device does not eliminate the need to have your cell phone in close proximity to the device and that you cannot store music on the device. So, instead of cellphone and headphones, (or ipod and headphones) it is cellphone, headphones, and large watch with multiple screens to scroll through in an attempt to control Spotify from the watch instead of the phone. All this device does is give you another screen to distract you from your workout. Disappointed.",1
0,"I previously owned Fitbit watches and upgraded from the Blaze watch and was very excited about the Versa2 so I purchased the Versa2 in Sept 2019 when it was first announced. I received the device and it worked great for a couple of months and then I started experiencing problems with syncing and responsiveness. I contacted Fitbit and after much testing and exchange of emails, they provided a replacement in January 2020. When I inquired if the replacement would be a new device, they said they could not provide that info. The replacement worked for about two weeks and then started having problems. Fitbit now says they can only issue a replacement and cannot refund the $200 unless it was purchased from Fitbit.com and Amazon only has a 30 day refund policy. I truly regret this purchase!",1
1,"We are at a technological point in history where some small devices can really have a big impact on the quality of your health and life. These Fitbit devices fit into that category. I cannot recommend these devices more highly. Keeping track and having awareness of your steps, calories, sleep, exercise and more have an effect on your health and well-being that no ordinary watch can deliver. I haven't even delved super deeply yet into all this Smartwatch and accompanying app can do and it's still had a very positive influence on my overall health and weight control.This is my second Fitbit (my first was the Adidas special edition) and I purchased this one primarily because I wanted the Alexa integration, which is so cool. It's not perfected yet, but it's still very, very neat. It feels like I'm in Star Trek and have the Encyclopedia on my wrist, lol. I've owned other Smartwatches (early Samsung model), but this one far outclasses those. The battery life is truly impressive. My Samsung watch required a daily recharging or you were wearing a dead piece of plastic on your wrist. This Fitbit lasts for days and days and when you do need to recharge it's quick and you are off and running again. This is especially impressive when you consider all the calculations, functions and features it's running.Also, the price makes this a virtual no-brainer. I like Apple products and have quite a few (Ipads, Macbook, IMac, etc.), butthe price point of the Fitbit is like a third of the Apple Watch. Add to that, I haven't heard all great reviews about the Apple Watch so you're putting out a lot of money ($400-$500) for something that might not do or be all you want. I got this Fitbit for $149 and if I was more patient I could have got it for $129 if I would have waited for the Black Friday/Christmas Sales. For this price point you are getting an amazing piece of technology that will serve you like very few others. I gave four stars because I feel like Fitbit still has some room for improvement, which I think they will realize. I've seen the reviews complaining about occasional dropped connections and you do have to have the Fitbit app up and running on your phone to use the Alexa function on your wrist, but these are small inconveniences for all you get with this product.If you are looking to get into the SmartWatch/Health Wearable arena this is a great entry product and might be the only one you need or want after you do. GREAT JOB Fitbit!",4
0,"This is my fifth Fitbit I've owned over the years, and the first time I've been disappointed with the product. Looks great, comfortable, tracks sleep, steps and HR, but the connectivity with the app is awful.It successfully syncs steps, HR, etc. about 90% of the time, often with a manual push through the Android app (even though it's set to sync automatically).Texts, emails, etc. get pushed to the watch successfully about 70% of the time. If I get multiple texts from the same contact, it might only show the first or last message. Other times it shows all. It's not consistent.It successfully connects with Spotify, Weather, all the other apps less than 10% of the time, usually only in the minutes immediately after reinstalling each watch app; hours later, it goes back to being non-functional. I have stopped trying to use these until Fitbit pushes out some software updates.I upgraded from the Alta HR to the Versa 2 in October because of the app functionality, and it rarely works. This is so frustrating and disappointing. I've spent hours on Fitbit support pages, resetting and reinstalling, but at this point I just have my fingers crossed for some major bug fixes in the coming months - anything to keep this from being a waste of money.UPDATE: A software update at the start of 2020 made it better, but not good. It connects to Spotify most of the time now, but half the time it does, if I try to skip or go back a song on the watch, it causes the Spotify app to crash on the phone. I have to then reopen it on my phone and try again.",2
0,"We might have liked the FitBit Versa 2 if we had been able to get it to work with my wife’s iPhone ( which already had the FitBit app installed) however the Versa 2 requires a newer version of the app, which requires iOS 11 or higher. My wife’s iPhone had iOS 10 and would not upgrade to 11. I offered to switch out my iPhone 8 Plus but frankly her phone sounds much better and would not switch nor would she consider a new phone because of my experience with the 8 plus. Unfortunately we had to return it.",1
1,"I used Fitbit Ionic for about 9 months and I sold it and bought Versa 2 primarily because I wanted Alexa function.First of all, one of the main difference is GPS , Ionic has it, Versa 2 doesn't . But in practice it has no meaning because in Ionic you use GPS built in (and consume your battery like there's no tomorrow) and everything is recorded in your smartphone's Fitbit app. In Versa 2, your hiking is still recorded and put in Fitbit app but this time it uses your phone's GPS. So, that means your Versa 2's battery is saved.Other than that, screen size is a bit bigger, looks sharper and Alexa -even though it's not perfect- works cool. You can ask Alexa to define a word or add something to your shopping list or ask what's the distance to Andromeda Galaxy just by pressing a button. For me that function is much more important than having a builtin GPS. I hike a lot but as I never leave my smartphone at home or at car when I'm hiking(I guess nobody does it ) having a builtin GPS in my watch is no big deal. My hiking is recorded anyways.Last but not least, battery life is fantastic! Every morning when I woke up I put my watch to charge and to get a break from wearing it, and it always shows something like %82-%85 left. So that's how much it consumes in 24h: around %15!",5
0,"I like the fit and function of the Versa 2. That's where it ends.The app they have for Android (and others in their forums say it's not just Android) routinely syncs about 75% of the things it should or at least displays erroneous information after a sync.Steps, miles, stairs seem to sync perfectly but battery level is shown at full in the app when you go to the device even if it shows correctly in the main page of the app at the top when it first syncs.Then if you want to change watch faces and buy a custom one, you have to go to the watch, it's clock face, settings and either get a blank page or it says it needs to sync so you can put in a code you got after purchase. It won't sync.Their circa 1997 support says to restart watch, phone, turn wifi on/off, bluetooth on/off, etc. Note that I say circa 1997 because these are level 0 support type of actions like ""reboot your PC"".The app is a digital hot mess and they only care about selling devices.This is going back ASAP.",2
1,"Well I have had this fit bit for about 45 days and it worked Awesome, suddenly the vibration function went out though...a little irritating as I use this watch for Notifications and stuff like get up and move and alarm in the mornings. However, I just got off the phone with Fitbit and they have a replacement on the way! Kudos to their team for helping me and getting a new on the way, I will leave this at 3 stars until I get the new one and if/when I get it, I will update.The watch itself when working does everything I want it to do and is quite accurate, a great step up from my Charge 2!Thanks - Steve",3
1,"I've had a number of FitBits over the years, and I recently upgraded to the FitBit Versa after trying to decide between a Garmin, FitBit, and the Samsung Galaxy. I wish I had chosen something else. The Versa tracks steps and sleep just as well as my previous FitBit Alta HR. However, where I am supremely disappointed is in the device's ability to track mileage. At the start, it seemed to track the same mileage on runs as my Alta HR did. Then after two months, it suddenly started tracking MUCH LESS mileage. I ended up driving the exact route to ensure the Versa was wrong. It was.I checked with online help, and then started running with my phone. Mileage tracking improved, but even with the phone, the same run two days back to back would produce results that were 2 miles different. I've found that I can do a run I know to be 7 miles, and the Versa will record 5, 6, 7, or 8 miles for it. See the two images...different days for exact same run.I find this very frustrating, and when I checked with my friends who have the Garmin, they've said they get very accurate results from run to run.If I had it to do over again, I'd get a different fitness tracker. This might just be the last FitBit I buy.",3
1,"I am quite happy with this product so far. I got it the day it was released, on Sept. 2, 2019. I've had it now for almost 1.5 months. I have owned more than one Fitbit and tried fitness trackers from three other companies, but this is my favorite so far. I have chronic sleep issues and so the sleep tracking app is the most important one for me. I am skeptical of the accuracy, and yet still I find it helpful. I love the screen and the battery life is vastly better than my previous Fitbit ""Blaze,"" which barely lasted a day on a full charge. During the time I've owned it, it hasn't exhausted the charge once. My only concern is that the screen has gotten some minor scratches, which surprises me because I don't use it in any rough activities. I purchased a screen protector, but because the screen has a nice rounded form, adding a protector is not as easy as for a flat surface. I think this product has lots of potential, and I would hope to see more apps developed for it. Although six weeks of use may not be enough, my impression is that this is a very good product for people looking for a well-designed fitness tracker. I wasn't much of a fan of Fitbit in the past, but that has changed thanks to this device. The reason why I am giving this a 4-star rating rather than 5-stars is my concern about the screen. I could be mistaken, but I wonder if the screen could be made of a tougher glass. Other than that, I would say this is a solid 5-star product.",4
1,"This is not my first fitness tracker, but it’s the first with a brand reputation for quality, and so far it has lived up to my expectations and the advertising.Pros: Sleep tracking is much better than I’ve had before. Good data. Customizable app - if you don’t want to be reminded to enter your food, you can remove that. I haven’t toyed with it much yet, but that was awesome. Pretty durable so far (2 weeks of treating it like an 80s digital sports watch with 50m water resistance ~remember those?). Bathing kids, washing dishes, banging it against a wall by accident- hey, it wasn’t my wrist! I DO have a cover on it- just a cheap little thing that came 3 in a pack for under $10 and it’s easy on and off. Protects the face from my bashing it about. I’m pretty rough on stuff- real tomboy at heart and never learned to be all “lady-like” or dainty. My kids play rugby if that’s any measure- with my complete support and a bit of jealousy that it wasn’t here (Oregon) when I was a kid. I would have looooved it. Anyway...Cons: My Versa2 came with 2 sets of bands - a nice woven set, and the classic style silicon. Sadly, the silicon doesn’t fit - just a bit too big to be able to make the attachment. Maybe it was a bad batch. I’m going to see about a different silicon band - after I read other reviews. Battery life could be a bit better, BUT, considering I have it set to “always on” watch face, and that it’s tracking activity all day and night - including heart rate - having to charge it every other day isn’t so bad. I can always change settings to reduce drain and extend life. I don’t know how much it would help, but I have confidence that I would get at least another day, maybe 2. And, it charges fairly quickly: an hour or so.Overall, I consider myself a novice fitness tracking user, and this one seems great to me. It’s not too complex for beginners, but looks like it will have more features for more advanced users (for a subscription, of course). I would definitely recommend this to anyone interested in having data to compare against your effort.",4
0,"This watch is a piece of junk and was a waste of money. It didn't even last 2 years. It's been about a year and a half since I got it, and it no longer works. The touchscreen has become unresponsive. For the past year, I've hardly left the house due to the pandemic, and the watch is in good as new condition. It hasn't taken damage or anything.Even before it stopped working completely, there have always been problems with the watch. Problems syncing with the app, problems measuring things like heart rate and steps accurately. Problems with charging and holding a charge.If you look online, you'll see that there are multitudes of people having problems with this watch, many of them within months of buying it. My wife got one for herself at the same time I got mine, and hers completely failed in less than a month. Luckily for her, she was able to return it for a full refund. I wish I had returned mine at that time. I wish I'd never wasted my hard-earned money on a Fitbit.The band for the watch is also very cheap and won't hold up well over time. After only a year and a half, it is already starting to stretch out, and I don't think it would be that much longer before I had to replace it.I spoke with Fitbit customer support, and they refused to replace the watch or even attempt to fix it or troubleshoot it. All they would do is offer me 35% off a new watch. A $200 watch should last longer than a year and a half! I've had $50 watches that lasted for years, longer than I wanted to wear them. I'm never buying a Fitbit product again.",1
0,"The software is amazing, but the new hardware is so cheaply made and highly inadequate. I got this as a present for a family member and the bands were ridiculous to try and swap out. I had a Blaze before experiencing the attachment on new Versa 2 and the bands on the blaze were a lot easier to change because it was a frame that the screen just popped out of. Now the bands are held by these little metal ""switches"" that are easy to remove, but SO difficult to try and get back on, especially when trying to attach the given L band. It wouldn't go on!! After about 30 minutes, I finally got the larger band attached, but at the cost of the silicone around the edges. The band was slightly too big for the slot so the silicone (? Not sure what material the band is made of) ripped around the edges and had to be forced in. Not happy with this at all. I am not sure who designed the new mechanism for the band attachment, but the status of their position really needs to be questioned.Edit: I lied. The software is NOT amazing. After about 3 days, it started tracking my family member's EVERY move. They scratch their face, 1 step. Wash their hands, 3 steps. Stand up, 4 steps. I have never seen a Fitbit so inaccurate. I am embarrassed that I got them such a defective product after telling them year after year how amazing the Fitbit was. I honestly don't understand what happened during the design of this watch (I have NEVER had this issue with any Fitbit product). So really, there is nothing good about this watch; it is just poor quality all around and a huge disappointment.",1
0,"I am so disappointed because my Fitbit Versa 2 died yesterday when I swam with it for the first time. In the choices of exercises to track, swimming is one of them AND the watch is advertised as waterproof down to 50 meters. I was swimming laps on the surface of my pool. I'm past the return window to Amazon, but am hoping the manufacturer will back up the product and replace it for me. If I do manage to get a replacement, I will NOT be swimming with it. I bought it only 8 months ago....",1
1,"So this watch definitely has some pros and cons. Overall I love it, but let's start with the pros.Pros:1. It is waterproof. The last smart watch I had claimed to be waterproof and the first time I did dishes with it on, it died. This one has withstood daily dishwashing and hand washing with no issues.2. I love the bitmoji background feature. It's actually really fun to see different bitmojis just about every time I look at my watch. It keeps things interesting3. I love that I can respond back to messages from my watch. (Only an android feature) I can send one of 5 pre-made customizable responses or I can do voice to text and send back any response. This was the main feature I wanted and the entire reason why I bought this particular watch.4. It has a lot of the same features as many smart watches these days, step counter, weather app, bpm, sleep tracking, etc. You get a 90 trial for the advanced sleep tracking but I won't pay for it after the trial is up. It's not a needed feature for me5. It has a decent battery life. Mostly it lasts about 4 or 5 days before I have to recharge.Now for the cons:1. You can't answer calls on the watch. This was a bummer but I knew this when I bought it. The text back feature outweighed the importance of answering calls.2. It does not track blood pressure. My last watch did and I thought it was cool to know my blood pressure on a regular basis. Obviously not a deal breaker but it's a feature I would have liked to have.All in all, I'm quite pleased with my purchase.",5
0,"I have had this watch for a month. It glitches nonstop and I cant get to any of the apps, let alone do a factory reset to get it to maybe reset. If I attempt to click on the screen it instantly goes blank and will not stay illuminated long enough to see any information. I am extremely disappointed, as this watch is basically junk now and of course amazon offers only 30 days to return. Do not buy this watch. Wait to see if fitbit figures out the glitches or spend your money on something more reliable.",1
0,This is my 4th FitBit and I loved all the others I owned throughout the years and I always purchased the best that FitBit had to offer but this Particular model has only lasted me 8 months and I purchased 2 of these so my husband and I would have matching ones. Mine crapped out all of a sudden 2 weeks ago and my husband said his also started to mess up a week ago. We take great care of them as we do not get them wet at all and charge them once a week but as of late these do not hold but a charge for 1 hour before it goes completely DEAD. I am extremely disappointed and decided to go with an Apple Watch instead because I don’t find it a coincidence that these version of the 2 FitBit crapped out within a week of each other after reading multiple reviews and troubleshooting issues that other are reporting the same exact issues. It’s horrible that they would release these products with this known issue. Going to miss the app but I no longer want to waste my money on something that’s going to crap out within months of using.,1
1,"Love this purchase! Highly, highly recommend! I'm going to comment on different features below:The Alexa feature is cool but not obnoxious because she doesn't speak back to you it just writes the response on the face of the watch.Super convenient that you can read your texts and answer phone calls from the watch itself (however you can't write texts back).Love how it can track calories, sleep, heart rate, and more. The sleep tracker seems accurate because every day when I check, it seems the timing around when I fell asleep and woke up are pretty spot on. I've even changed my alarm to a time when I am in a lighter sleep stage and it is easier to wake up.The app is amazing and the amount of food they have in the system makes it so easy to track calories. They also have a good assortment of exercises too to help me track my movement and calories even more. Has legitimately helped me lose weight.Water proof feature is AMAZING! Wore it in hot tubs and pools when I went to the spa and it still works perfectly. Sometimes I wear it in the shower too. Truly water proof not just water ""resistant.""The battery life is great and lasts super long.",5
1,"I have been around the smart watch family for some time with different Samsung, Apple, Asus, and Fitbit versions. If you are looking for an upgrade from your original Fitbit to be able to receive texts, this is the watch for you. However, if you are into technology and a more quick/customized experience (you've just been waiting for the heart rate tech and the tech to merge into one), Apple and Samsung offer better platforms. They are a little more expensive, but provide more versatility and cohesiveness. Fitbit is moreso known for their technology in the perspective of tracking health accuracy, not necessarily their technology when it comes to the user product.",3
0,"I've had this watch for almost 2 weeks now and it is just plain trash. Spotify requires a premium account to use on it. The other apps are very limited. Oh, and most importantly, IT WON'T STAY SYNCED. Which wouldn't be too bad if everything on the watch wasn't controlled through the phone app. Even the time is a synced requirement. It hasn't synced for 24 hours and it is already 4 minutes off.The Alexa feature is also hit or miss. Found it mildly useful less than a handful of times. Oh, and imagine this greatness if you will. If you ask Alexa to set an alarm everyday for a set time, and you need to change it or cancel it, better hope your watch syncs or that stupid alarm is going to go off everyday at the specified time.Also. Changing out the wrist bands is a lot more of a PITA than it appears/needs to be.I don't often rag on products.I really wanted to like this watch, or to at least justify my purchase... But it just plain sucks. It is a glorified pedometer that isn't even accurate. I should have went with the Garmin.",1
0,I think Fitbit has some major issues they need too fix. Where to begin you you put a heart rate sensor in the watch to get your heart rate and an sp02 sensor also. Then you charge us for putting them in the watch. But now if we want to view are sleeping heart rate or any sp02 data or a bunch of other information we have to pay $10 a month. What a joke. I mean undisputed Garmin's watches are better and more accurate. They give you a ton of more information with thier watches and dont charge a monthly fee??? I'm not writing this telling people to buy or switch to garmin I'm just using this as an example that thier competitors have a better foot in the market than they do and charging customers for something then making them pay a monthly fee to use it is just ridiculous. Also I ran half a mile while I was driving to work somehow still haven't fixed this issue I see.2 weeks into use I thought I would post a bit of an update. I started getting into serious running this week with the watch and about 4 miles into my run my sweat and the rubber of the watches band caused enough friction to break the skin as seen in the photo above. I cant even go running with this watch wich is why I bought it. Now I owned the ionic and didnt have this issue they must have really cheaper out on the bands to these. Also since the latest fitbit OS battery life is terrible down to 5 days instead of 7. I've made my decision to return this watch.,1
1,I just purchased my fitbit versa 2 on 12/7/21 and set it up yesterday 12/12/21. So far I really love it. It was pretty easy to pair it with my cellphone. I have a large wrist so I had to take off the small band that comes installed on it and put the large band on that comes with it also. Switching the band was tricky because it's such a tight fit to get the pins to line up with the holes on the watch. So far everything is working flawlessly and all of my calls and notifications are coming through every time. Definitely glad I decided to go with the versa 2 and not the versa 3. I understand that you can not store music on the versa 3 without a paid monthly music service like Spotify or Pandora. You can store music on the versa 2 without a paid music service and that was my reason for choosing the versa 2. Also the versa 2 is at least $50.00 cheaper as of now December 2021.UPDATE: UNFORTUNATELY This fitbit versa 2 died on me today 12/26/21. It only lasted 14 days and it just completely stopped receiving my text messages and incoming phone calls. I tried for two hour's to set it back up and nothing worked. It just wouldn't reconnect with the Bluetooth on my Samsung Galaxy smartphone. I called Amazon today and we started the return process. I'm glad it happened during my return window of 1/31/21 or I would have been out of $130.00 and stuck with a useless fitness tracker. I can no longer recommend this product to anyone.,5
1,"I have heart failure and several other heart conditions. While Fitbit wants me to use it to monitor my heart in exercise, I use it to keep a record of what is happening when my heart isn't doing as it should. It has a SPo2 sensor which is not activated yet on mine and Fitbit says only 10% are at this point but at some point that will provide useful data as well. So far in 3 weeks it has picked up 4 issues I would have not known happened. I already know my heart tachs but one night I was sitting for over a hour when I felt slightly light headed. I looked down and my heart was going over 170 beats per minute. It lasted 6 minutes. While I thankfully knew this condition already existed, it is a record I can bring up to my doctor as going from 62 bpm to over 170 while not exerting any activity is exactly what kills people. The other 3 were mild in comparison and only to the 120-140 range. It also tells me ( and very accurately somehow ) exactly when I fell asleep, woke up and how I slept in that time. I was expecting this to be my trouble zones but oddly enough my sleep cycles, heart rate and general health sleeping is far better than I expected. As for partially using it as designed, it allows me to get more exercise than I was out of fear of pushing my heart. I now know what I can and cannot do within reason and have started to push myself more for it, adding heart health and life. I no longer have to worry is walking around the block is causing my heart to peak and if it starts to, I take a breather. They cannot suggest using this for this due to lawsuits, medical reasons and more, but the reality is use it. Monitor it. Accept it. Don't hold them liable. It works and it works damn well. The only issue I've had with it is getting it to sync with windows 10( tried 2 dongles ) on a desktop so I had to purchase a $70 smartphone that was Android 9.0(anything over 7 claims to work, my old phone was android 5) so I could sync it. Thankfully even though it only syncs to the phone, that information is instantly applied to the windows 10 fitbit app where I can scrutinize the results more clearly. In my honest opinion, every human on this planet should have one.",4
1,"When my Charge 4 screen went haywire about a month after the warranty expired, FitBit offered 50% off on my next FitBit, so I got the Versa 2 mainly to track pulse, steps and sleep. It has done admirably with all three (as long as I factor in that it counts my vibrating Harley as footsteps when I ride).About 18 months into ownership, though, I contacted FitBit because battery life had dropped to about 17 hours (worse than Apple Watch, and I never did get the advertised 6 days, even after taking battery-conserving steps).I even came out and asked, “Can I get a discount on my next purchase, seeing as I cannot count on the watch when I go camping for the weekend and am away from a place to plug in?”And they said, “No, because your watch performs perfectly. We do not consider decreased life on an aging battery to be a defect.”This a watch on which FitBit does not offer battery replacement, not even at the owner’s expense.So yes, it does what it is advertised to do. But, it is, by FitBit’s own admission, a disposable smartwatch. Look at the price they are asking and decide for yourself whether you want to pay that much for a disposable watch.",3
1,"So I got this when it first came out in fall of 2019. I've had little to no problems throughout the years, sometimes it gets annoying with updates but that's just technology. You can add apps on it (it even has flappy bird!) Which is cool. But I've always mainly used it to track my sleep/steps/etc, and along with getting notifications from my phone like if someone called/text and as an alarm. Mainly all the basic needs, I'm not tech-savvy at all. Hell it took me like 2 years to figure out I had a rear defrost in my corolla. 😅 I'm 25 I should know better, but I manage to figure out how to use this device so if I am able to, you should be able as well. I always charged it when I was getting ready for the day so it will last the whole day, if I skipped a day I'm sure the battery will last 3 days. To me that's not bad since I charge it everyday or every other day. HOWEVER, Recently last week I had an issue with the battery, it kept draining fast like it would be gone in 2 hours if that. But it only acted up for a few hours than went back to normal. I ended up turning off certain settings; like notifications so help save the battery. I'm getting a new one just in case this starts dying again. For it to last almost 3 full years to me that isn't bad. And that was my only big problem with this device and it has only happened once so far. (knocks on wood aggressively) I got my money's worth out of it. As long as you take good care of it, it will last. Unless you get a defective one but that's just how life is, a hit and miss. And always buyer beware for anything you get online. Just because it works well for me doesn't mean it's going to be great for you.",4
0,"I've had my Versa 2 for 22 months when the heart rate monitor which also informs sleep analysis stopped working. Went through a factory reset with online chat. Didn't work.

I received follow up email a few hours later from same contact in the online chat saying my Versa was out of warranty and so sorry, but here is a code for 35% off a new order. As I read warranty is 2 years so I don't understand why they are not standing behind their product. Why I would buy another one if it lasts less than 2 years. Too bad, if they refuse to honor warranty I'll just go try another brand.",1
1,"My family is fitbit fan for relatively long time. My Ionic was broken so i decided to purchase Versa 2.I am basically satisfied to my choice. If I must say, I wish its bezel was slimmer. Comparing with Apple watch 3, even though AP3's design is 2 years old, still it looks stylish and appealing. Honestly speaking, I like the design of Apple Watch more. However considering the function like sleep tracking, Alexa, and longer battery life, I thought Versa 2 was better fit for my daily use.",5
0,"I bought this Versa 2 to replace the Versa 2 that I had worn for nearly 2 years and it was great. I purchased this knowing how it works, both watch and software, and we excited to set it up.It took forever to set up, even on Wi-fi , no big deal, but not only did it say it was not capable to have some of the same apps (find my phone) but then it constantly kept shutting off. It also gave a slight vibration about every 20 seconds. I checked all my settings, made sure it was charged, all was well so I did a factory reset and tried again. Same thing.When I went on to Chat for some guidance, I put down what my issue was and the customer service person asked me if it was charged, told me how to charge it (like I said, 2nd one, I know how to charge it) and then asked if I had purchased the battery. She proceeded to tell me that the watch I purchased required me to buy the battery separately. It had a battery or it wouldn't have shown me the level that it was charged at! also, WHAT NEW WATCH DOESN'T COME WITH THE BATTERY????Normally I would just request an exchange but if this is the kind of customer service I can expect.... I will buy a Samsung at Best Buy. Just thought I would let you know that your ""help"" is telling people they have to buy a battery separate on the purchase of a new Fitbit. Yeah....no thanks.",2
0,"I got this as a gift in January 2020…AGAINST my daughter’s recommendation because she had two that stopped working even before the warranty expired. I should have listened.The design is good, the screen large and easily readable (when it worked), nicely customizable, the band is comfortable, and I can wear the watch to swim/shower etc. the battery lasts about a week, which is impressive. Charging is quick, it takes less than an hour for a full charge.While it was under warranty it would occasionally just not record sleep, steps etc. and the watch face would disappear. I’d reset it, change the clock face and it would work again for a while. It also only occasionally showed me the notifications it was set to show me. I set it not to remind me to move, but it still did. I set the app to use cellular data so I could log food while not on my own WiFi , but it never wouldWithin a month of the expiration of the warranty the watch stopped recording anything and the touch screen was unresponsive. I reset it by pushing and holding the button. That didn’t work and put the watch into a state of confusion as it just kept cycling through the startup process. I read the Fitbit Versa 2 forums and found out that MANY Versa 2 owners had the exact same issues and a Versa 2 that is unresponsive needs to be replaced. I called customer service who directed me to do everything I’d already done. That worked somewhat…I got a clock face and it did record my steps, sleep and heart rate again…but I couldn’t scroll through the apps and the touchscreen was unresponsive. The customer service rep advised me it needed replacing and offered me 25% off a new Fitbit…so my $150 watch lasted exactly 13 months.Today it is apparently logging my steps, but the face of the watch is completely blank. I can track my steps on the app only.This is my fourth Fitbit, I started with the Zip, that was simple and good. Then I moved on to a Flex, then a Charge….this Versa 2 is my last Fitbit though…it’s too expensive a watch to last just 13 months before major problems, and as of today it’s going in the trash. I strongly recommend you do not buy a Fitbit.",1
1,It's totally amazing what this watch does. Best item I purchased in a long time. Highly recommenced! Very easy to set up!,5
0,"So I’ve had this for a year and a half and specifically chose Fitbit over an Apple Watch because of the fact that a Fitbit… is for fitness. Or so I thought? (Like it has fit in the name?) I wanted this to track my heart rate and the heart rate sensor at rest is great. Sleeping it’s great. When you’re doing light exercise it’s okay. But as soon as you do moderate to intense exercise, the Fitbit literally calls a doctor and has you declared legally dead and your heartbeat is at 0 (or at rest). How is it that I’m running and can barely breathe and my heartbeat is still reading 92? Well two issues, apparently sweat messes with the sensors since it’s a reflective light. Cool, let me dry off my arm, doesn’t work. Let me wear a sweat band! Doesn’t work. And second, the movement of your arm also messes with the calibration. Okay then I’ll wear it tighter? Looser? On the inside of my wrist? Higher up? Nope, nothing. I’ve had these issues since I’ve bought it and finally gave up and bought a chest heart rate sensor. Once this thing craps out I’m buying an Apple Watch. I’m sorry, I tried.",1

 What I use it for is pretty basic. I don't do Spotify or store music on it. I mainly use it for time, sleep, steps, heart rate, alarms, and now the microphone for replying back to texts or using Alexa. Well 2 weeks into it my microphone stopped working. After sending some videos to Fitbit they agreed to replace it and sent me a return label. Unfortunately the return label was for FedEx Smartpost. I shipped it on the 12th of Nov from Portland, OR and it's estimated to deliver in San Francisco 13 days later on the 25th. Then the replacement won't ship out for at least another week._________________________________________________________________________________Update 12/19/19I finally received my replacement on Dec 5th (3 weeks and 2 days later). The replacement, like the first one, worked fine for a while. On the 12th day I noticed the microphone wasn't working again. The first thing I did was all of the troubleshooting steps they had me do the first time, including resetting it back to factory settings and starting over. Nothing worked. After a long chat with Fitbit they said my case was escalated and I'd get an e-mail. The e-mail in short said they'd replace it, but I had to mail mine in first (like before), but this time I had to pay for return shipping. Um NO! How about you send me a replacement first and I'll send mine in after I receive it so I don't have to go ANOTHER 3 weeks without it. Especially since I use the silent alarm to wake up at 4am so I don't have to use my real alarm and wake up my wife. The MAIN reason I went with this instead of a original Versa or another brand was because of the Alexa built in. Well that doesn't do a bit of good if the microphone doesn't work. Other than the mic issue, I like it, but would not have purchased it knowing what I know now! Buyer beware!!! BTW, in the attached videos, I'm holding my mouth up to the microphone which is a lot closer than it should need to be.",1
0,"This is my second Fitbit that I've owned, and I'm disappointed with it. The step counter does not seem to be accurate at all. I wake up in the morning with over 100 steps despite not getting out of bed during the night, I wash my hands and I'll get 50 steps, I'll be standing at my job not moving and I'll get steps. Everyday I've got almost 20,000 steps but I know I'm not moving that much.It also doesn't register when I climb stairs. I live on the 3rd floor of my apartment building so I should get roughly 6 sets of stairs everyday, but it only registers 2 and usually that happens while at work (where I don't climb any stairs).The display is nice, but I don't really look at it for anything other than to see what time it is. I use it to track walks and workouts, but it struggles to connect/stay connected to my phone so I don't really get to see my route on a map.I don't like Alexa or the fact that it has a built in microphone. Call me crazy but I'm always wary that it's listening to my conversations.Anyways, I'm disappointed I bought this, but oh well. I probably won't buy another Fitbit again.",2
0,"Just bought the Versa 2 & already returned it. Was on Fitbit Support 2x for a total of 2 1/2 hrs. Finally found out it isn't compatible with any tablet, any laptop, nor with windows 10. Plus I was told right now only works with cell phones. I checked b4 I bought it &was told my Samsung S6 would work & in the set up it does say it would be compatible & still it didn't work. It only works with 7.0.1 version of android or newer. Not sure with iPhone as I don't have. Just thought I'd put it out there so no one else gets mislead. Support also said unknown when other platforms would be added.",1
0,"I like the copper color of my Fitbit Versa2 and it is with regret that I like nothing else. I suffered a frustrating couple of hours trying to Bluetooth pair with my Samsung Note. The phone would recognize the Fitbit and then fail to complete the connection. Turns out the issue was out of date software on the Fitbit that required a wifi connection. I'm rural and don't have always on wifi as I use my phone or tablet as a Hotspot. The second instruction after 'charge your device' should be to connect the Fitbit to a wifi network.The pedometer function of this Fitbit Versa2 is very accurate as long as your feet are moving, but, if you wear it while sleeping, napping, cooking, pulling weeds on your knees, reading a book, the step count is wildly inflated. Usually by 300- 350% where in reality steps = 8000, Fitbit steps = 24000. I suspect many people are deluding themselves if they trust Fitbit step count. Can't software remedy this inaccuracy by reconciling arm movement with GPS data?I'm neutral on the sleep function as it may be fairly accurate. Same in regard to the heartbeat monitor.I would not utilize the Alexa function even if I did have 'always on' wifi. I'm annoyed that this Fitbit will vibrate as some kind of alert and the display doesn't inform me what's up. I've had it for about 3 weeks and can't view notifications, emails, messages, music (I have Spotify subscription and it's just simpler to access via the phone). The touch display most often does not respond to my touch (I've opted for the normally off display and disabled the microphone).Overall, this Fitbit Versa2 seems to be good at trying to get you to purchase additional services and doodads. I should return it to Amazon, but, will keep it as a reminder to be skeptical of hype. The clock is accurate.",1
0,"Be careful - if you want things like knowing your heart rate while you sleep you have to pay another $80/year or $9.99/month to access it. This is not mentioned in the product description, a pretty deceptive practice. To say I'm disappointed that it'll cost me more than half the cost of the unit to access data it's already collecting is a grand understatement. Since they make money selling your aggregated (non-personal) data, I think they should provide your own data to you for free.",2
1,"I think my main problem with this watch is that I tried an Apple Watch 3 Series shortly after and even though it was $30 more (both were on sale in November, this $129, Apple $160) the Apple Watch was just so much better and definitely worth the difference.-The Versa 2 looks a little ridiculous on small wrists. Some reviews say you can’t tell them apart, but Versa is a bulky square and the 38mm Apple is a more streamlined rectangle and looks more flattering. Versa 2 also raises up slightly higher from your wrist.-The Versa transmitted messages and phone calls from my iPhone consistently (both do), but I couldn’t answer with it.-Versa 2 lacks a speaker. Apple has one.-Scrolling through the apps on the Versa is much harder than the burst of apps you get on Apple Watch. The app selection is limited on Versa.-I liked the free Fitbit faces that included exercise rings, but they are not nearly as cute as the motion faces on Apple Watch. Versa has almost too many third party faces (made me uneasy about data security) you can buy so it actually took a lot of time to find the free Fitbit face I liked.-I was excited about the always on display with the Versa 2, but it is limited to only a few clock faces and the always on face became an uglier hollow version when I dropped my wrist. The Versa is much less responsive to wrist movements to wake up than the Apple and I often had to tap hard to wake it up when using regular faces.-I got better battery life on the Versa 2 (4-5 days vs 2 days on Apple Series 3).-The sleep tracker was very nice to have on the Versa 2, though I soon downloaded the cheap AutoSleep app on my Apple Watch and it was equivalent. (Apple does not come with built in sleep tracker.) Neither is 100% accurate.-The bands are quite a bit harder to change on the Versa 2 (pins on Versa vs buttons on Apple), and the selection for Versa is much more limited.All in all, the Versa 2 is good but is too bulky and lacks the overall functionality and sleekness of an Apple Watch. Hands down if you’re between the two and have an iPhone, I’d say go for Apple 3 Series!",4

0,"I purchased the Versa 2 in May of 2020 and have been very happy with it, and the Fitbit app... up until a week ago. That was when, out of nowhere, the screen started to die. It is intermittent but has gotten progressively worse. While the Versa keeps tracking your sleep, steps, etc... the screen is almost always a solid greenish-blue color with no functionality. Unfortunately, because Fitbit only warrants their trackers for a year, I'm out of luck. Which sucks because, (1) other than this issue, the watch has been great, and (2) I would expect a watch to last at least 2 years. Sadly, after searching Fitbits forums it appears this is a known issue and the only resolution is to replace the watch (if you're under warranty). If your not under warranty, you're out of luck. I came to Fitbit from a Google OS watch, and it was a HUGE improvement so I plan on giving them one more shot with the Charge 5, but if I only get 2 years out of that one, these might be the last Fitbit products I own.",2
1,"I bought my versa 2 on October 8, 2019. I didn't like the band so I replaced that one with a magnetic highly reviewed band found on Amazon, link below. I also added a screen protector that I replaced twice, link below. I loved the versa 2, the app, the app connections to Myfitness Pal, MyChart, VeSync etc. and overall functionality. I specifically wanted to use mine to count my laps in the pool and that worked fantastically! One note about the music - I downloaded songs that I had purchased previously on Amazon through the desktop app onto the versa, this allowed me to listen to music without bringing my phone along. If you want to listen to your Spotify account you have to bring your phone - I was never able to find a way around that.Unfortunately, after 17 months the face fell off and it sounds like this is a normal thing. Of course the face couldn't just fall off, it fell off when I was in the shower so the internal components were soaked and it no longer functions. So now the question for me is, how long do I expect a $150 product that I wear almost 24/7 to realistically last?I see now that the new Fitbit trackers are waterproof and count laps (Inspirelink to the band - https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07YYW5SM5/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1link to the 10 pack of screen protectors- https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07Y1N9TMV/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1",3
0,"I have been a Fitbit fan for years. Not now. Check the reviews for the Fitbit app before you spend your hard earned money. As of recent Fitbits no longer syncs and Fitbit has totally been unresponsive to fix it. They are great when they work, useless when they don't which has become more and more often.Update 09.13.20 - After trying to update my Versa 2 it froze. Had to go on Fitbit forum to find out how to fix it. There are a lot of people with the same problem! It worked for me after trying it several times but most had to get a new Versa. I had to reset my watch and delete my device and start from scratch. Pain in the butt. Fitbit is just going from great, to bad, to worse! Now we have to reset, delete the app and reinstall the app and so forth every so often just to keep it working and connected. It’s become too much of a hassle to keep this thing connected and running properly. If you go to either Apple or Android app stores there are nearly all one star ratings in recent months about their app and devices. No wonder the Fitbit forum isn’t open to the general public. Also, recently it suddenly it holds much less of a charge.Update: Since the update my Fitbit no longer forwards text messages to me. It also changed a lot of my settings which I had to reset to the way I wanted it. It turned on sleep, do not disturb and kept turning off the always on feature. It worked so much better and was more reliable before the update. Now it doesn't sync as reliably and I've had to delete the app and reinstall it to get it to recognize the Fitbit. I really like the idea of the Sense, but with all the problems I've been having with the Versa 2 I can't soaking even more money into a product of Fitbit!Update: February 2021 - Fitbit dies last month. Screen just went dark and after searching for fixes on the internet nothing I did could turn it back on. I had it a total thirteen months. Fitbit has forgone quality for quantity!",1
1,"Day 3 since I began my health journey with the aid of my Fitbit (we'll call her Jan).The Fitbit app tells me about the quality of the foods I eat and counts my macros. I just scan my food on the Fitbit app (which is free, btw) and it counts everything for me so I don't have to. It has helpful nutrition articles as well. You don't need a Jan in order to utilize many of the cool features of the Fitbit app's free service--just use your phone to help you log your workouts and food and manually input your weight and measurements.One of the nice features of Jan that my other fauxbit had is the sleep count--although Fitbit's sleep tracker is more in depth and pays attention to your sleep cycle and can wake you up to half an hour before you set your alarm based on when your cycle is less likely to cause drowsiness. This happened yesterday (my alarm was set for 9:12am) when it woke me up at 8:47. Talk about a look! I glared at Jan because I had half an hour to sleep but then I realized that was dumb, I should get up. So I did and I felt no grogginess.Today I woke up at 8:07 on my own and my sleep quality index gave me a good score of 85% (yesterday was 88%). I woke up a lot but I blame my sun burn and sore muscles. We'll see how tonight's sleep score does as my sunburn is already improving a lot since yesterday. (Was working in the yard almost all afternoon)Also something I'm super happy to report is I've lost 6 pounds since Monday! I kept trying to start this earlier but my family has been detrimental to my waistline. I'm all like ""I'm going to start eating right"" and my husband is like ""hey, you want a chocolate cake for mother's day?"" And I'm like ""NO I SAID I AM EAITING RIGHT!"" And then my cutie kids are like ""here's a giant size bag of starbursts, your favorite!"" And I'm like ""now I must eat all the candy"" and that's pretty much my life in a nutshell.So. I hope you're all doing well with your health journey. There are tools to help you (the fitbit app is free and you get 90 days of premium with the purchase of your fitbit)",5
0,"As a fitness tracker its OK, not spectacular. The band swap out is nice, decent battery life (if you don't leave the display on continuously), and looks average.Reliability is poor. I am on a second replacement now inside of 1 years. No abuse, nothing exotic in the daily wear but they just keep failing. First one had the display go dim and become unreadable after 5 months. Second one (replacement) just up and quit, won't charge or do anything, after another 5 months.For the price I was hoping it would last longer than a year. I had bought this to replace an older Fitbit that crapped out just past the warranty. Now I think these failures are a feature, not a bug and it is time to move away from Fitbit as a brand, buy a better watch for a bit more money and get a longer lifespan.So far I have bought 4 Fitbit watches (1 still works, 2 replaced under warranty and now dead so 5 dead total), 2 Fitbit scales (1 died out of warranty, current one won't connect and out of warranty)....all told well over $1000 down the drain. Lets raise a toast to the slow learners like me! I won't buy another Fitbit.",1
0,"I have been a Fitbit user since 2014. And I don't know why I keep getting them. Every single Fitbit I have ever owned has failed, glitched out, or died. Every. Single. One. This one took all of five months to get a ""snow screen."" It started having a problem with the display, so I contacted customer service. I was told to do a factory reset on it. So I went ahead and did that. It fixed it for about a week. Then the display turned into a snow screen, like the one on an old TV when a station went off the air in the 1980's. So I am told to send it back and I will get a replacement once they receive it back. They use to just send you a replacement when it broke and it was under warranty. Now they want their failed product back. Since Fitbit pays for the cheapest, slowest return shipping possible, my broken Fitbit has been circling California for the past two weeks through FedEx Smartpost. And when I asked customer service why I had to wait this long for a replacement when Fitbit put out another flawed product, the customer service rep was snarky and of absolutely no help. This will be my last Fitbit. I am switching over to a Galaxy watch. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time. All you have to do is look up ALL of the problems in the Fitbit community shared by other Fitbit users. Seriously, just Google Fitbit Versa 2 problems. Don't be dumb and keep giving them money for seven years like I did for cheap, low quality, overpriced garbage.",1

My husbands works amazing, which we bought from Fitbit directly, so we know its a good product. Great battery, great tracking, comfortable, and works as it's supposed to.The problem? After waiting for this second order since the first never showed up, we are incredibly disappointed with Amazon. This is the SECOND Fitbit we have ordered from Amazon that arrived USED. Not just like someone tried it on... no... this one isnt even a Versa 2 in the box. The bracket is broken, the cracks and crevices are filled with dirt/dried skin, and the package is gross. Im returning this and never ordering a Fitbit from Amazon again. The lack of checking to ensure the product is good is terrible. There is nothing more disgusting than opening a package and have someone elses crusty broken product in your hands...",1
1,Well I bought this for the sleep tracker and because you could put music on it. The only way I found I could put music on is with a premium account from a music streaming company I resisted at first and tried to put my own music on it but it was unsuccessful. So I tried the premium service and I loved having the music on my watch for 4 months. Then the music stopped downloading and after contacting support instead of fixing it they removed the music that was already on my watch making the music feature useless. So in one week I went from loving and recommending this watch to hating it. UnFortunately there are not many watches suitable that you can actually put music on. Everything else I basically like but being I chose this particular watch because of the music feature I am very unhappy with Fitbit and I am looking for something else now. Fitbit has been zero help in resolving this seems like they and Deezer the premium music service can't figure out whose problem it is so they blame each other and leave the customer with no solution at,3
0,Bought two of these on October 2019 and both have broken as of July 2021. These watches only last about a year and for the price it’s disappointing. Thankfully Amazon’s stood by their protection plan so we were able to get one repaired and the other replaced. Will not be buying any more Fit bits after this due to poor quality. My sons Fitbit screen froze with a huge red X and the repair time was a month. The 2nd Fitbit purchased the screen actually came apart from the watch and I used super glue to hold it down. About 2 weeks after that the screen turned grainy white and resetting it did not work. Contacted Fit Bit but since it was just over the one year warranty mark we were advised we had to buy a new watch. Fit Bit support was unable to fix any of the issues. Thank you Amazon for making this right! Once these Fit Bits break (hopefully we have a year) we will be purchasing another brand of watch to count our steps daily. The watch did work great for about a year but for the price it’s not worth it. Was expecting them to work for at least two years. We took care of our watches and had a protective screen cover; never went swimming in them or had them wet yet the screen on both gave out.,1
1,"I have been wearing the Fitbit Versa 2 for about a week. I like the watch/health tracker, but there are some things I do not like. One was the silicone wristband. I find that it makes my wrist sweat a little. I've already bought a cloth wristband (from Amazon named ""XIMU"") and I like it much better. I like the Echo Alexa feature for my Smart Home. I don't know if I would have purchased the Versa 2 had I not been given incentive by signing up for the Amazon credit card.I think the watch face is pretty in rose gold, however just a tad big if you ask me. [I have not worn a watch in years b/c of smart phones.] I bought a face protector brand named ""Orzero Newzero"" from Amazon and it fits well. I like it.I honestly was considering returning it as it was but I will keep wearing it and see how I like it with the new band. It is just so much more comfortable.My reason for initially purchasing it has nothing to do with exercise as much as it does for the heartbeat feature. I recently had an A-fib incident and I want to keep up with my heartbeat to see if there is a continued problem.I haven't gotten the hang of the sleep tracker yet but we'll keep trying.I may update this review later on.",4
0,"Not as water proof as they'd like you to believe. I went swimming in mine two days in a row, removing it to air dry the first day, as advised. The second day, the whole display became detached from the metal casing. The thin, black adhesive was hanging off as well. The display was hanging by the wiring, but still working. I dried it out and decided to use some adhesive to reattach it. The device had died in the meantime (the battery was low when the incident occurred) and I placed it on the charger. It will not charge at all. I did not purchase the extended warranty, and my initial warranty is over. I definitely won't buy another. Why put a swim tracker on them if the crappy thing is going to come apart in the water? Ridiculous.",1
0,"I am a long-time Fitbit user so a bit pained to have to share this experience, but I would never buy this tracker again (and am not sure whether I will buy any Fitbit again, to be honest). It left a horrible, red, peeling rash on my wrist - the first time I assumed it was somehow my fault (maybe soap residue was left under the band when I washed my hands, etc) but the rash took forever to heal and was very painful - not at all like 'normal' skin irritation you might get incidentally while living your life. Once it had fully healed, which took over two weeks, I started wearing the Fitbit again and was VERY careful about making sure it was fully dry, that it was loose on my wrist, etc - within a day and a half it was itching and burning again.At that point I googled 'Fitbit Versa 2 rash' and the first link was to the Fitbit Community forum, where there were HUNDREDS of posts all about the same issue, most from January 2020 (people saying 'I just got this for Christmas and...'. I was really upset to find out this was a widespread, known issue and Fitbit was still selling this product anyway. I contacted them first rather than just return it, and was passed to a special service team for this specific issue.I am pleased with the final resolution that came directly from Fitbit (full refund) but still upset that it is even being sold when it's KNOWN that it is causing consumers issues. I do not plan to replace it with another Fitbit device (although until now I have never had any issues with Fitbit and have cycled through many different generations of Fitbit products, always owning one and using it every day), at least for some time. I need to think carefully about whether I plan to give money to a company that knowingly sold a wearable product that literally caused me and hundreds of others a product liable to cause something like a chemical burn when worn exactly as it was meant to be, despite the years-long history of satisfaction I had with the company and their products prior to this.",1
0,"I spent $175 on this because I wanted a quality piece that would do what it promised it would. It did not. I wore it appropriately tightly... it didn't bounce around or slide on my wrist. Yet it never, ever, had the correct heart rate. When the treadmill at the Gym said I was at 141 bpm, the fitbit had me at 120. When I moved to the elliptical, the elliptical had me at 142 bpm... the fitbit had me at 171.My max heartrate is 147. If I had been at 171, I very likely would have suffered very serious damage.Further, I kept it well charged... it does charge quickly enough. 2 or 3 hours. But for the last week I owned it, it recorded zero minutes of sleep. Zero. I only took it off to shower... I slept with it on.But here's the worst part: When I called FitBit customer service, they asked me if I was wearing it tightly. When I said ""yes,"" they said ""We're sending you an email with a dozen or so articles to read so you can fix the problem.""For $175, I don't want to fix the problem. I don't want there to BE a problem, but if there is, I want YOU to fix the problem. And if you want me to fix it, not only will I return the Fitbit (I did) but will leave an honest review on your Amazon page to keep other people from suffering the same fate I did.Will not buy again.",1
1,"This is my third Fitbit watch. It replaced a clunky Surge that got to the point it required daily charging. I say clunky because the Versa 2 is much more stylish, and more comfortable to wear sleeping. I hesitated making this purchase because it was not clear from the information available that your current day flights of stairs would display on the watch. It turns out it does if you pick the right face. And speaking of that the number of free faces available is amazing. Besides flights I am concerned about steps, heart rate, and sleep. Sleep info is available only on the app. I can't comment on Alexa or other functions as I have not used them. The battery is only making it about four days on a charge, but it charges in about an hour. Why does there have to be a different proprietary charger for each model? I'm happy because the display is fantastic. First criticism; It occasionally misses a flight, but I'll live with that. Second; the little nub on the band that holds the strap flat. It was the same with the Surge and I find the lack of improvement inexcusable. It's makes taking the watch off and putting it on too much of a chore. I'll have to live with that, but come on Fitbit you're getting really close.",4
1,"Overall i'm very happy with this purchase. The watch is great. Activity tracking has been fun, especially the sleep tracking. Also, this watch is pretty nice looking. Four stars though because when I was first setting this watch up and pairing it with my phone (pixel 2 xl), the syncing process, and also updating the watch's software, were both a bit wonky. I had to try each multiple times to get it to finally work. But once it did, I've really had no issues since, which has been great.",4
1,"I bought my wife the Versa 2 to replace her Versa for an early birthday present. She was extremely excited to get it and open it up last night! Here are some notes after her first night of using it:1. Setup was quick and easy, including setting up Alexa (just had to log into our Amazon account)2. Since I bought my wife the Special Edition, she gets 3 free months of Fitbit Premium. She has already signed up for a couple guidance programs and has already done two meditation sessions through the app. So far it seems like she really likes the Fitbit Premium experience and has already talked about buying it for her mom for the holidays (who also has a Versa)3. Of course, she's already loved the sleep data and is focusing on getting more ""good"" night sleeps4. In addition to the nicer screen, one of the best (and most important, in my opinion) parts of the upgrade to the Versa 2 is the faster processor, which makes everything so much faster and smoother on the smartwatchI'm now torn whether I should upgrade to the Versa 2 or keep my Ionic until Fitbit (hopefully) releases the Ionic 2!",5
0,"I liked this thing from the start. I bought it mostly for sleep tracking. And it worked very well. It gave me REM/deep sleep cycles, with restless sleeping indicators. It was perfect.I also used when walking for heart rate and foot steps. That worked well. And also used the timer for time on my stepper.But while wearing it during sleep, it would cause my arm to ache. And on my left arm, it cause extreme soreness that I couldn't use my arm without it being painful. There are stories online about people having arm issues with this device.My arm still has weakness and pain. I haven't totally gotten over it.",2
0,"This is my second and LAST Fitbit. I am sick of spending hours resetting devices in the hopes of it syncing to my phone. The stair counting is awful. Its set for commercial stairs of 10+ feet so usually misses residential stairs. Fitbits advice? As your going up the stairs raise your arm over your head so the fitbit sees a 10 foot elevation change. Ok. I learned to just disregard the stairs count. Next the distance walked pie chart started looking for 8 miles despite being set for 5 miles so the pie chart never fills. Ok, still says I walked over 5 miles so just ignore the pie chart. Does fitbit fix the display? No. Now, with the latest update, the time is 7 minutes slow despite syncing to my phone which has the correct time. I've tried everything they suggest. Reset the phone, turn bluetooth off and on, reset the fitbit, drop and re-add the fitbit, change time zones and change back. Nothing works. So now I have a watch that can't even tell time! Never again will I buy a fitbit product! They are all garbage!",1
1,"As a small disclaimer - I bought my Versa 2 through a local retailer earlier in the year since I was able to take such an amount off with coupons. Were it not for that though I probably would still be using my first FitBit watch, an Alta HR to this moment. The deal was hard to pass up and just for $10 more I bought some extra bands and cases here on Amazon, perfect for me so I could keep my motivation at a high as I was expecting to be home quarantining for months.THE PROS/FEATURES:- A step-up from any old FitBit model on a budget (especially if you can get one for under $150 USD).- Battery is advertised to last 5 days, but you can potentially stretch it 1-2 days past that point.- In addition to the battery life, this thing charges pretty fast!- AMOLED screen - beautiful picture on a small screen, and plenty bright to see outside on a sunny day.- Very easy to wear for hours at a time, even through periods of sleep.- Accurate heart rate readings; I've noticed taking my own pulse the watch is at most 3-4 BPM off.- Application support, with a few standard with the watch - Spotify, Pandora, Alexa to name a few.- Able to setup push notifications right to your watch, from nearly every app. Even simple stuff like the news.- Appealing watch faces, with many custom choices available for download.- Waterproof to an extent, can even setup exercises for swimming activities- Able to time and track specific physical activities, including sports and use of workout equipment.- Integrated feature to find your phone by setting off a LOUD noise; do not do this with headphones in!- Able to answer or deny calls right from your watch, even supporting iOS.- Ability to track your sleep, though not perfect and some insights on that data gets locked behind a paywall.- Fun challenges to take on yourself, or compete with others.OKAY/SUB-PAR:- A majority of custom watch faces are paid, and it is a pain to determine which are free or need to be bought.- Some durability issues, which could be partially adverted with third-party cases/screen protectors.- Current price should be lowered given the recent release of the Versa 3 and Sense.- Included charger does not support watch cases, and the charging cord should be way longer.- Lack of customization when the always-on display is in use.- Cannot use applications such as Spotify or Pandora without relevant subscriptions.- The only way you can power off or reset the watch is a hidden option in the ""About"" area under settings.- Alexa app has no audio feedback and will lack full functionality w/o Alexa app installed on your phone.- Offers use of a tool like FitBit pay, but you can't use FitBit pay for things like watch faces or subscriptions.- Google Assistant now supported, only for the newer watches despite previously announced to support Versa 2.- Weather app will ask you to sync if it's been awhile, will not show any weather otherwise.- App choices are slim and are nothing compared to what you'd see on other high-end smart watches.- Should let users have more information you can track, such as how Apple lets you record things such as symptoms.THE CONS:- No built-in GPS and instead relies on your phone to track location.- Cannot respond to texts from app (such as a pre-canned message) on iOS, supported on Android.- Bare minimum Alexa features such as no support to control smart home devices.- Zero integration with Google or Apple's health applications.- Many features locked behind premium service, despite ownership of a spendy watch.- No speaker, but I suppose this makes sense given it's a watch and not a phone.- Warranty is not done directly through Fitbit, and they may likely direct you to Square Trade.- Lackluster customer service and have personally experienced two cases of rude customer service agents.- If you have a feature, you have to go to a vote-based suggestion forum that is essentially a graveyard for all sorts of user-submitted ideas (some examples on this later).THE BAD, UGLY:This completely concerns the Fitbit application, because I have such a strong dislike for it. First off, there's often troubles with syncing whether it be syncing your watch where you'll sometimes get the message it cannot find your Fitbit device - this even extends to little things like Spotify, so about once or twice a month I have to sign out and sign back in to get the Spotify app to work. What's more is sometimes the app bugs out in little places, I'll have times where I want to switch or install a watch face and it will get stuck (to the point of where the only fix is to change the face manually from the watch, and restart my phone). It's also worth mentioning there are Mac and Windows versions of the Fitbit app but they're a colossal waste of time and not fully-fledged with features like the mobile versions. Last but not least what bugs me the most is a lack of a dark mode (despite having previously suggested by users over 5+ years) which includes both the iOS and Android applications. On iOS there is also no home screen widget support, a feature Apple rolled out with their most recent firmware update. Finally and as mentioned earlier there are a number of features locked behind a premium plan which includes things like better insights on your data, workout tips and even simple recipes - this will cost you a hefty $120 a year via. monthly plan or just under $80 through an annual yearly plan; for a watch you have already paid over a hundred dollars for.OVERALL THOUGHTS:For how big the smart watch market is today, the Versa 2 being now in the past generation of Fitbit's watches still holds up well with the caveat the sale price still hasn't been lowered, which definitely should be the case as new watches (and even those not from Fitbit) are out with more and better features. This is a perfect option for somebody on a budget, especially if you're an existing owner of a Fitbit watch. But because there are other options out there such as Garmin, Apple, and even Samsung you may want to do heavy research on what fits you best.Personally speaking this is my fourth year of using Fitbit devices and may consider a new model when I have the money to upgrade. However with the pile of issues the application has, the absence of not considering ideas from the community and even the price for what they are I am thinking also about other brands for my next watch.",4
0,"As you can see from the picture, this thing is not accurate. PulseOx says my heart rate is 104, manual check verified 104, but versa says 82. Doesn't track heartbeat, sleep, or stairs well. Does not work over tattoos. Alexa feature stopped working on day 2. You'll get more help from Google than from fitbit support. Those idiots are clearly reading from scripts and getting their support elsewhere. Put you on hold 3 minutes, come back, ask another question, hold 3 more minutes, rinse and repeat. If you have any type of wifi that uses real security, like MAC filtering or network profiling don't bother contacting support. They can creepily tell you that your versa2 is connected to your phone and what the battery charge is, (probably more) but that's it. You'll have to figure the MAC address out on your own. I had to scour my logs to see what was being rejected. Still haven't heard back from support on the Alexa issue. I was told the case would be ""escalated to the specialist group"" and that someone would contact me by email. Horrible horrible support. The app is clunky, a little difficult to navigate, and lacks a dark theme or night mode. Don't jog at night and open the app. You'll be blinded by the searing white and get hit by a car. The band's are strange lengths but somewhat easy to switch out after a little practice. For me the small goes to the third from last hole preventing me from tucking the excess into the keeper while the large tightens to the first hole leaving a lot of excess band. Neither fit properly. On a positive note, it does look nice and the battery life appears to be 5-6 days. Basically it's just a fancy expensive watch you can get the weather on if your close to your phone.Update: second versa 2. Alexa worked for three days. Got a new phone galaxy S10+. Reset versa 2. All fresh installed apps. Alexa still doesn't work. This thing is garbage. Fitbit support wants to replace it. Again....Update 2: have had the replacement less than 2 years. Could never get Alexa working again. Now, the heart rate and O2 sensor have stopped working. It's literally a watch. Garbage. Do not buy Versas. Go with another brand.",1
0,"I went with this watch so it would track my active minutes. I'm very disappointed that the band snapped after less then a month. Also, I think it's crazy that there isn't a 'find my phone' feature/app included. This is basically standard on any other watch I researched. I have been considering returning the watch since this feature isn't available. It's a major disappointment.Just FYI, Fitbit is well aware of customers wanting this feature. It is documented in their forums since at least February 2015 for different watch models. There appears to be a badly functioning paid app available for install, but after paying over $200 for a watch I'm not enthusiastic about paying more for a feature that should be included. Only a little bit of programming needs to be done since the connection between phone and watch is already established.Also, it's crazy that my GPS has to be active on my phone for it to sync notifications. This drains my phone battery very quickly and is totally unnecessary. I think there are some major design flaws with the Fitbit Versa 2 device.",1
0,"I can’t use my Fitbit Versa 2 because it has been locked for weeks. I was able to use the step counter but now the watch won’t sync and update either. I had a cheaper fitness tracker and ran into similar issues but was always able to correct the issue. This Fitbit is not useful to me since it is stuck on the wrong day. Additionally, when I tried to begin the setup over, the code is sent to my watch but I can’t see it because it is locked. I could not be more frustrated with this device! I will have to go back to my smaller no name fitness tracker because at least that one will sync with my phone and give me the correct time.It is now weeks later since I sent the defective Fitbit back. I still have not received a replacement watch. Fitbit has not taken any initiative to provide me with any updates concerning my return. I have contacted FedEx and they said that Fitbit used a cheap return delivery method and they couldn’t tell me when I would receive the replacement watch. When I requested a refund from Fitbit, the representative said that I can’t get a refund because I purchased the watch on Amazon. The watch stopped working less than 4 months after I purchased it.I am left with having to call Fitbit weekly to get an update. I wish I had just gone with an Apple product.",1
0,I had high hopes for this watch taking a chance and paying three times as much as dozens of other watches that look identical. With the name Fitbit being one of the most well-known and will established smartwatch manufacturers I expected they would have their act together.1. The interface / getting around the software on this watch is clunky at best awkward and disorganized. Just trying to find the most basic of features on a smartwatch... . The sleep module is ridiculously hard to do. It's easy to find heart rate monitor calorie burning and step counting but try to find the icon for the sleep feature... Go ahead try!!The $30 smartwatch I purchased previous to this that looked identicle in shape and size I was easily able to find an spo2 feature. On this watch the feature does not appear as a separate module and when I try to download a watch face that displays spo2 it says it's unavailable for this model.Bluetooth: I have never had a smart device disconnect from Bluetooth as often as this one does. It seems like every 10 minutes it's asking me if I want to pair the device. in 2022 this is unacceptable. When I search for solutions none of them seem to fix this consistently.Sleep monitoring. My Galaxy watch monitors my sleep automatically and is relatively accurate. The first night I had this watch on my wrist I woke up in the middle of the night took a look and not one ounce of sleep was monitored..... Since I can't even find a sleep module on the watch I look to my smartphone in the app and shows zero sleep tracking activity monitored. Maybe because the Bluetooth can't seem to get attacked together between the watch and the app?Doing good thing I had to say about this watch is that it was very accurate when I monitored my activity on my treadmill and my weight lifting and it is nice that it has food module you can log the food you eat.My wife who has sleep apnea is especially disappointed in this device not being able to monitor her sleep. If I can't get this resolved I'm going to have to return both watches hers and mine. They been manufacturing smart watches I think longer than anyone else..... You think after all this time they could have their act together?,2
1,"Customeer service was easy. I signed into my account told them the problem, went through trouble shooting and then they offered a replacement. Still not happy it doesn't hold up but....... Hasn't held up for me. I motor a lot. A min day is about 12 thousand steps. I walk, garden, clean horse stalls, and the last fitbit I bought was April 2 2020, ( approximately 3 months on this one) its now July 5th and it has done what the one I bought 8 months before this one did. The screen just goes black and its done. So within a year two of them have stopped working. I plan to call their hot line on Monday since on the second one I saved my invoice and purchased the extra insurance (which only is good after the manufacture warranty is over) I will up-date the outcome of customer service at fitbit once this happens. Of course it stopped working on a holiday weekend so I most likely will be without my watch for at a min a week (wishful thinking that they will send me a new one fast) Not sure why I am having such terrible luck with these. I keep it dry, I keep it clean. Frustrated.",3
1,"I wanted to love you Fitbit Versa 2, I am REALLY trying to love you! Idk if I received a dysfunctional watch but I've had so many issues and overall frustrated/disappointed:- updates take forever to complete- even though 'all-day sync' is turned on, it doesn't always work...sync errors constantly occur and I would have to go into the app to manually run the sync- the app store is EXTREMELY LIMITED w/ apps no one probably even uses or heard ofNow for the apps that were preinstalled (and you can remove them if you'd like except the apps by Fitbit like Exercise, Today, Alarms, Clocks, Weather):- the music apps Spotify, Deezer, Pandora will not work unless you have a premium account.- Philips Hue refuses to connect to my bridge no matter what troubleshooting I try.- Even though I added my Starbucks card to the Starbucks app, it took hours before it registered on the watch; even after numerous syncs.- I downloaded the NYC Subway app and it worked but then each time I tried to access it thereafter, it said 'undefined'Don't get me wrong this is a smartwatch of great quality! If you need something for minimal usage, to track your activity, sleep and exercises then this is the way to go (which is why I've kept it...trust me I purchased the Fossil Sport and I am way better off with my Versa 2. Though the look of the Fossil is sleek and shall we say more modern/high-tech, don't waste your $$ if you can't wear a smartwatch for a day without charging. Yes, the battery life is THAT BAD!!). I digress... The Versa 2 is very easy to use, the fit is neat and lightweight, not clunky at all and the touchscreen/resolution is great. You can add up to 5 clock faces to choose from and the battery life is AWESOME!! So far I've gotten approx 6 days. Oh, and it holds up in salt water - tried it out at the beach and was pretty impressed.",3
1,"I was so accustomed to the small size of the charge 2 that I was hesitant to get the larger Versa 2. The first thing that I noticed is that it is a bit thinner in height than the Charge 2. That small difference means it no longer snags on seams when I put on shirts! The size is kind of large when I look directly at it but when seeing how it looks on the arm in a mirror it looks fine. I wear the large size band but have narrow width to the wrist where it is placed....maybe 2"" across. Looks fine. The accuracy in high intensity sports (racquetball) is so much better than the Charge 2. The charge2 would record maximums of ~123 bpm when I was huffing and puffing. The Versa 2 reports > 155bpm during this type of exertion which is much closer to reality. If I look at my worst exertion it reads closer to the 170 I'd expect. I've read reviews that the clock face is difficult and time consuming to change. I disagree. Once you find the one you want the download takes maybe 10 seconds and the watch keeps all that you have tried in its folder. The one that I chose (pictured) has big enough lettering/numbering that I can read info without my reading glasses (I'm 57). Setup for all the functions was very easy since I already had the fitbit dashboard set up. I initially got a fitbit to assist with checking my sleep quality. The Versa2 adds the sp02 reading to sleep stats so that I can check to see if there is a trend with blood oxygen levels which may point to other avenues to check for sleep health. Overall, very satisfied with this watch.",5
0,"I have purchased between 3 to 4 different fitbits in the past. I had the fit bit versa the 1st gen and it worked fine, minus the display being compromised either by it not working or freezing or being over worked by its possible small processor.I have done this time and time again with a unit and spending the usual amount that they ask and getting a replacement for it once it stops working. I call and they are helpful in making sure I get another unit sent out to me. Well it happens again and again to the point where I'm done purchasing this thing.Well now the fitbit versa 2 comes out, maybe this has less bugs and it has been fixed. WRONG! Don't fool yourself there is a reason they have sales on this item from time to time. This unit freezes and crashes and out right does not work when it wants. I sweat a lot and maybe the sweat is breaking this item, but its waterproof or resistant to a certain degree. I never shower with it and when I wash my hands I always pull the watch closer up the forearm so that it doesn't get wet. The watch just freezing and just outright doesn't want to work anymore. I called for a replacement and they instructed me to keep the bands and don't worry another one will be sent to me. I don't have the face unit since in the past they never asked for the face unit since its defective and doesn't turn on anymore so a replacement is sent. They wanted me to pay my return shipping to them and have the unit sent to them as well. I asked for a return label and they stated read the returns and warranties.Do yourself a favor and find another market for watches. This companies stocks have been falling nonstop, and now I see why. Don't waste your ""time"" or money buy from some other company, or don't and buy and waste your mental health on dealing with this company.",1
0,"Update: I’ve really learned to hate this thing. Because of its shortcomings it really gives you no insight at all. I splurged for the pro subscription (in for a penny, in for a pound) and it is even more frustrating. I walked all over a huge hospital today pushing my husband in a wheelchair and it recorded a measly 4800 steps (if your arms aren’t swinging you’re not recording steps. Also, careful how you hold your shoulder bag, gotta swing those arms like an orangutan if you want steps.) And the stress management insight MIGHT be helpful if it worked which it usually doesn’t. No data. They have a lot of nerve charging for functionality that they know does not work consistently. Really.The things it does, it does just ok. For instance, it tracks your sleep. Usually. But not always. For no reason it will just skip a night. This is frustrating as it usually fails on a night when I’d really like to know. No explanation why. Then, it tracks your flights of stairs. But not always. In my house, I run up and down the basement stairs frequently to take the dog out, to grab something from the freezer, etc. but since the flight is not quite high enough, it usually doesn’t count any flights at all. Why isn’t this a setting you can change? Then, you have to pay a subscription fee for advanced features, that’s just annoying. The wristband can be irritating too. Overall, not a very good product. Disappointing.",1
0,"Bought this to replace an older Fitbit Blaze. The Blaze heart rate monitor worked great while using a rowing machine. The Blaze was old and battery didn’t hold a charge very long so I thought I would upgrade to the Versa 2, but I was wrong!The Versa 2 heart rate monitor works well, until you do any kind of fitness activity.When I started using it on the rowing machine, it showed my heart rate as 80, after a few minutes of rowing, it might increase to 110, but after 5-10 minutes, it would drop to 55 or so. I am no where near an Olympic athlete and don’t think an Olympic athletes pulse would have dropped to 55 either. I compared to to my old Blaze and also a chest strap - those two were close to each other and around 130 while the Versa 2 was showing 55-60. The Versa 2 heart rate monitor was not accurate for running either. What good is a fitness watch if the heart rate monitor isn’t accurate during fitness activities?I called Fitbit and did what they told me to do with the same failed results. Fitbit customer service/technical support is the worst ever. I asked them if the Versa 2 doesn’t work for a rowing machine and never could get an answer.I returned the Versa 2 to Amazon and got another one with the same results, so I returned the second one also and bought a Garmin Vioactive 4. The heart rate monitor for the Garmin watch works when using the rowing machine and other activities.Amazon is great for returns, Fitbit is terrible. I was a loyal Fitbit customer for 10+ years, from the first tracker, even purchased Fitbit products for family members, but never again!",1
1,"I got tired of cheap watches poorly recording nightly sleep and finally got the Fitbit Versa 2. Finally, a watch with accurate sleep records! It gives time awake, deep, light, and REM sleep and they seem to correspond to reality. You also get a sleep score for every night with more than 3 hours sleep. It too seems more accurate than the cheaper watches. I also like the different watch faces available, with dozens of free ones. You can also download a great number of apps as well, also dozens of free ones. This watch shows calories burned and you can easily add foods and quantities for accurate food logs. The Fitbit app gives thousands of different food and brands for accurate logging of calories and even allows custom entry of food like everything that goes into a dish. You can even scan barcodes on foods to put in calorie and nutrition values of store bought foods. Once you have added these custom foods once you don't have to do it again. There are a lot of fitness exercises I'll never use but you can chose the ones you want and discard the others. I like walking best. When I go for a walk, it estimates your stride and transfers it into miles so you can easily record totals. It even connects to GPS on your iPhone (or android) and you get an accurate map of your walk. This would be great for hiking. This watch and the accompanying app does a lot more. The online manual is 80 pages! I highly recommend it. I found out what is wrong with my sleep and the app tells how you can work toward better sleep and overall fitness. Don't be fooled by the cheap watches and get a really decent one that will correct your sleep and fitness. At $129 at Amazon, the Fitbit Versa 2 is truly a fitness watch. You could also pay hundreds of dollars for an Apple Watch but this one really does a lot.",5
1,"I pre-ordered the Versa 2 and it arrived! The amount of joy I felt as I opened the box to reveal this beauty. It’s lightweight (for some reason I thought it would have a heavier feel on my wrist), the battery so far is what I expect with getting notifications and pretty much jus excited to look at the Bitmoji clock face all the time. The Versa 2 is an upgrade coming from a Charge 2. I didn’t have any issues syncing the device with my iPhone. I have not tried using it in water or the shower as other reviews peoples watches already malfunctioned so I’ll refrain from taking the chance just yet. The pandora, Spotify and Deezer all require paid subscription to use so that’s a downfall. ( Free subscribers should have the benefit to listen to the apps). My only reason behind giving this watch 4 stars at the moment is because the app must be open on my iPhone in order for Alexa to work. I find it odd it keeps asking to sync and let app run in background. Maybe it’s an early glitch but that is kinda annoying to someone who already has Alexa products. Overall If they can fix the bugs, the watch is great for tracking steps, sleep, and keeping goals for health and fitness!",4
0,I use timers at my job all day multiple times a day. This watch is utterly unreliable when used for either a timer or an alarm. The timers just simply refuse to work 50% of the time. I can literally check on the timer 10 seconds after setting it and it will sometimes say “no timers set.”Other times I will try to set a timer and it says “there is a problem setting a timer at this time.” Even worse is this message sometimes pops up 10 seconds after set the timer. Totally unusable in a professional setting.The alarms are just as bad. Granted its not a feature that I use frequently on my watch but it should work!The watch desyncs from the phone way too much as well. A lot of the time when I go to check the weather or whatnot it tella me to resync with the phone.I’m selling this garbage on ebay.,1
0,"UPDATE 1/7/22I reached out to support on the second device they sent me that stopped working after 8 months and they offered be a 35% discount code to purchase another device. Why on earth would I spend more money on a device from them when they do not last?! Again, do not waste your time or money, and if you do at least get the most extended warranty available because the 2 devices I received did not last more than 10 months before something stopped working on it.I bought my Fitbit versa 2 in March of 2020. Within 10 months my versa stopped charging. I tried everything to get it to charge but it wouldn’t. I contacted support and they had me ship it to them so they could make sure it wasn’t charging. After a few weeks they mailed me a new versa 2. Now after 8 months of having the new device, the side button stopped working so I am unable to use that at all. It’s very frustrating to spend $200 and to have to deal with support now on multiple occasions with two different devices.After spending $200 on a well known brand with good reviews I thought it would at least last a year, but don’t count on it. Very disappointed fitbit.Don’t waste your time or money on this.",1
1,"I am not into fitness or a health nut. I see people wearing smart watches all the time and I really just kinda wanted one. My mom bought me Fitbit Versa 2 for Christmas, and I am pleasantly surprised!!! There are quite a few options on here that I won’t use since they are related to working out and taking care of yourself (lol). But there are other things that are very cool and relative to my daily life. I especially like the fact that I can get text messages and Facebook messenger notifications. I have a two-year-old, and I am not on top of my phone as much as I used to be. I also loose track of my phone often when im chasing her around the house. So it’s nice having something attached to my body just in case I am away from my phone when an important message comes through. I also set it up So I can get CNN updates, and weather! I was a little worried about the watch being bulky or uncomfortable. When the pandemic started, I had to start working from home, so I haven’t put on jewelry or gotten dressed up much at all. So the thought of having to wear something on my wrist all day seemed undesirable. But It was very easy to get used to. The watch face is very flat and doesn’t stand tall on top of my wrist, I’m very cozy! Overall, I really love this watch and don’t have any complaints.",5
0,"The media could not be loaded.
 Amazon shipping was fast. My low review is strictly on the Fitbit Versa 2. Great watch at first, easy setup, worked as expected, charged about every 5-6 days. Sleep monitoring wasn't really accurate, would show me sleeping just laying in bed reading. Bought in June 2020. In April, less than 1 yr after purchase, I contacted Fitbit support because the display started going wonky, see video. They replaced the watch in June. 2 months ago, the replacement started messing up, too dim to see unless I'm indoors & notifications are intermittent. Customer support has informed me that there is NO warranty on replacement watches, so after only 3 1/2 months on the brand new one they sent me I'm SOL.Will never give Fitbit another dime!",1
1,"I’ve only worn the watch for a few days so I will definitely update this review after I’ve had it longer but here are some things I noticed right away.I went with this model specifically for the music. However, you can’t just log into Spotify and listen to your playlists. You have to PAY for the premium subscription for all 3 music apps on the watch in order to stream them through it. Why in the world does a watch with Amazon Alexa not come with the Amazon music unlimited app? An app that I already pay for which would be way better than the 3 offered on the Fitbit.Another issue with the music: I’ve tried 3 different sets of Bluetooth headphones and they all sound terrible. However, when I connect it to my Bluetooth speaker, it sounds fine. The entire point of me getting this was to listen to music on my runs without having to lug my phone along with me. I also don’t want to carry a speaker. :/The accuracy doesn’t seem as good as what I’ve heard about other Fitbit models. I went for a walk this evening just to test it out because the numbers didn’t seem right. (I edited this next part after what just happened the last couple hours) I walked another 150 steps but the watch is showing well over 300. Also, as of tonight, It was 12:03 am; the watch had just reset for the day and I already had 90 steps?!! I was standing in the living room talking to my partner, look down at my watch and it shows 110 steps when I was literally just standing there?? I was upset the first day when the watch was missing steps but adding them is another ball game entirely.The fit is good, even with the big face against my bony wrist. I hate wearing watches but after a few hours I barely noticed I was even wearing it. The design is cute and I love the color.",3
0,"After owning an Apple Watch 4 for almost a year, I fell and shattered it. I love my watch except for the short battery life and the high price. I opted to give Fitbit another try having had one prior to the Apple Watch due to reluctance to spend another 400-500 so soon.I have tachycardia and need to keep a close eye on my heart rate even at night. Fitbit Versa 2 does nothing more than show current pulse. This was the first disappointment. The clock faces are rudimentary and most are hard to read. Access to apps is disappointing. The phone app is not user friendly. The watch itself shows only very basic information.The last straw, though, was trying to pay for a clock face. I kept getting a code instead of a clock face. I would pay for it, and a few hours later, the code shows up again. This happened 3 times before I gave up and went back to the on board clock face.In conclusion, the Versa 2 is probably fine for someone who has basic needs and has never owned an Apple Watch. It's glitchy, the app crashes often, and overall, it's a disappointment. I've requested a return.",1
0,"I have had a FitBit for about six years and I've always been happy. This one is the most frustrating I've ever had. I had issues from the start and took me four days to even get the device set up to connect to my app. It does not sync, the display is black half the time so I can even use it as a watch. It is even black if I hit the button on the side multiple times. It randomly vibrates but then won't display the screen. Every time I contact FitBit they say ""to try the factory reset."" I have done this, the device won't take it, now it is stuck in a never ending ""unsuccessful"" period. Right now the watch is stuck on ""sync to reset"" and the app cannot sync with the watch.They offered to have me send it back and give me a new one, but honestly, this seems a consistent problem with the product NOT my exact FitBit. I even asked if others were having these same issues and they said yes. Super disappointed, unsure how to proceed apart from purchasing an Apple watch or the like. They are more expensive, but I'd rather pay more for a product that works vs. a product that does not work. This design never should have gone to market with so many bugs. Completely unacceptable.",1
1,"I have had this Fitbit for about a year now and have a pretty good understanding of what works well and what is just okay. Now let's be clear, to me any Fitbit is a fitness tool first, and everything else second.Now in regards to the fitness features it does okay, but it is not great. I work in a pretty sedentary profession. I have to purposefully get out of my chair just to get the blood pumping. I also bounce my legs a lot while I am working. Between the typing and leg bouncing, the step tracker can count a few hundred steps an hour just while sitting. This leads to thousands of miscounted steps throughout the day. I compensate by setting a higher daily step goal. I am not sure if the technology in the watch can tell the difference between me actually walking or if it estimates steps based on breathing and heart rate. Nonetheless, it is less than even close to accurate. That said, the floor counter seems pretty accurate as I have to go up a flight of stairs at least 4 times a day, sometimes more, and it does seem to count each flight has I go up. As far as the sleep tracker, I am able to compare the data from the Fitbit and my CPAP. It is not bad, but again it is not amazingly accurate. Personally, I trust the CPAP data more than the Fitbit data.Here is the great news! The secondary features are pretty awesome. First, the built-in Alexa is great for anyone who is an Alexa power user or for someone who wants a basic entry-level Alexa device. Also, with the most recent update, Fitbit added a ""Find Phone"" feature that works whether you phone has the ringer turned on or off. Finally, my favorite secondary feature is the ability to reply to texts by speaking replies into the watch; it is amazingly accurate most of the time with both spelling and punctuation. It also does a nice job working as a low-profile caller ID when I am in a meeting. I can also say that my wife is more responsive to both calls and texts as she usually keeps her phone on silent and before we purchased these watches she would always tell me she didn't hear the phone.I still use this watch daily, but more as a secondary device to my phone and not as a fitness device. There are plenty of features that I do love and do work very well, which is why I still give it 4-stars.",4
0,"Very disappointed with Fitbit. I used to love their products. I’ve been using them for years and periodically upgrading to newer models. I never had an issue until last summer. I went swimming with my Versa 2 after reading you could but then it completely crashed. I did more research and found that is a common issue yet they say you can swim with it. So I ordered another Versa 2 on 7/7/2020 and it’s already trashed. Only 9 months later! The battery is no longer holding. I used to charge it about every 5 days, then two weeks ago I noticed I was having to charge it more and more. Now it has to be charged twice a day. It just isn’t worth it. So after being a loyal customer and app user for several years, I’m done with Fitbit.",1
0,"This Fitbit is expensive with great potential.Unfortunately, the user app is terrible and it’s a pain to setup and navigate.It’s not accurate at tracking actual steps as even minor movement is counted.A minor yet incredibly annoying detail is when I turn my wrist to check the time or step count it rarely ever turns on.The find my phone function worked for a week and now it rarely sees my phone and says to “move to another location and try again.”Hardly any good screen skins for the Versa fitbit so I’m left using the default one.I definitely regret not getting the Versa 3 or charge 5.Shell out the extra money and get an apple or Samsung smart watch.",2
1,"I had the Fitbit Charge 2 previously, which worked great, but I wanted the ability to read messages on my watch. This watch does a great job at everything it claims to do, but I have two complaints:1) I've noticed, like with my previous watch, that it counts steps from movement, and not necessarily from taking a step. I was working retail during the holiday season, and the watch would say I did a few hundred steps while I was standing in place stocking product on a shelf. And I can't hold on to the sides of the treadmill or the watch won't count my steps- I have to hold my arms down at an awkward angle, or not hold on to anything, which for someone who is clumsy and unsteady, is kind of scary. I constantly feel like I'm going to fall off the treadmill.2) I have the Bluetooth connection on my phone on all the time, but often I notice my phone and watch aren't syncing, where I'll get a text or Facebook message, and it won't pop up on my watch. Not a deal breaker, but kind of annoying since that is the feature that made me get this watch in the first place.Overall, I'm pleased with this purchase, and I get a lot of use out of it.",4
1,"The pros... I love the feel of the watch. It fits so comfy and I love that it has a little notch on the watches band loop that locks your watch into place. I love that you can upload and pay with your credit card from your watch, the step count is very accurate as is the heart rate monitor. And I am slightly content at the very most about the messaging feature. Now the cons... You would think for this price, this watch would be a lot better. Before this watch I had a $60 watch that did way, way, way more. Yes, yes, yes, the watch has some really great features... that only work with subscriptions. But unlike my $60 watch, this watch has no ""find my phone"" option. It has no way to control your music that you are playing from your phone. Yes this phone offers Pandora and Spotify, but you need subscriptions. But I am subscribed to Amazon Music. And yes this watch has Alexa, but it doesn't support the music portion of Alexa. Also, this watch has a very limited version of Alexa. So limited in fact the only thing Alexa can do from this watch, is set an alarm 😒. Everything else is ""not supported"". Like texting someone. ""Alexa, text Jose""... nope, not supported. The only way I can text Jose from this watch is if he messages me first, then I can simply reply to him... or any other contact who messages me first, hence why I am slightly content at the most with the messaging on this watch. My other $60 watch I could only read the messages, not even reply. So I guess in that context, I upgraded. I just feel like compared to the cheapo deepo watch I had before, this watch was extremely underwhelming. So no, I probably wouldn't buy this again.",3
0,"Instead of an Apple Watch I got the versa 2. I have all apple products, but after reading the reviews and all the capabilities the versa 2 has I decided on this. I love the way the versa 2 looks and I haven’t had any discomfort wearing it. I love it motivates me on making sure I meet my step requirements and Takes my heart rate so I know when I’m resting or burning fat. However, I have had difficulty from day one with syncing to my Apple phone. After working on the trouble shooting tips for 3 days I finally got it to synchronize with my calls and calendar. After owning this for several weeks and updating the app, my phone and the watch I still cannot got my text message alerts on it. I’m very disappointed as I use that with work daily. It should be able to do the main functions as advertised and not be so difficult.",2
0,"I'm so frustrated with this watch. This is my second one in a month. I chose this one because overall the reviews were good and it was $50 off on prime day. Win/win, right? Well...It doesn't calculate mileage correctly. I have a 5 mile loop that I've mapped with multiple devices. Every time I take that loop I get a different result. The only time it seems to get it right is if I leave the app open on my phone and re-sync every few minutes. This is extremely frustrating when I take a different route or a new trail. I have no idea how far I've gone because I apparently can't rely on this watch to track it correctly. I can't focus on my workout because I have to keep re-syncing the damn thing!The alarms are also very unreliable. With both watches I set up a week day alarm to wake me at 4:30am every day. It worked perfectly for about a week. Now it either doesn't go off at all, doesn't vibrate at all and I just see it going off on the screen when my backup alarm sounds (which I shouldn't need), or it goes off at a completely different time than it's actually set for. This morning I was already up and I waited...it went off at 4:53. Yes I have it set correctly, it's been triple checked. Yes the smart wake it off. I've tried all the suggestions from Fitbit and nothing seems to work for more than a couple days if at all. I'm pretty set on returning this one as well and purchasing a different watch altogether...that's not a Fitbit.",1
0,"I had the Fitbit Charge for a couple years and then the heart rate monitor stopped working. That is my main focus so I got the Versa. I have only had it for a couple months and the heart rate monitor is not accurate anymore, it's way off. When I know my heart rate should be 150+ it says 90 or 100, something ridiculously low. The screen is already chipped, again, had the Charge for a couple years and it never chipped. I liked watching my active minutes until the App changed them to active zone minutes and obviously if the heart rate monitor isn't working then the active minutes won't be correct either. I went with the Fitbit over the Apple watch and I wish I hadn't. I've read the Fitbit has a better heart rate monitor but obviously that isn't true. I also wish challenges were based off of active minutes, not just steps, since I don't get steps for riding my bike or using an elliptical. I've used this watch to track my hiking and even when it's connected to my phone the GPS is way off. I do not like any of the free watch faces, the one I ended up using the numbers on the time overlap and are different shades so that makes it hard for a person to see that needs reading glasses, which you don't always wear. It is pretty much a complete bust for me.Update: Still hate it. Will never buy another Fitbit. Just like a lot of stuff the product/company was good in the beginning but now the quality is slipping. I finally got Fitbit to replace my Versa 2 and guess what, it does the same thing as the first one. I will be hiking, up hill for hours and my heart rate has been low, like 66, or 80 and then 2 minutes later it's 140, constantly jumping all over the place. I have been walking fast on my treadmill and the heart rate has read 204!! When I've talked to the company they say ""this is normal."" Their active zone minutes and calorie burn is based off of heart rate so those are completely off since the heart rate monitor is complete crap. I hiked for 4 hours and my heart rate was crazy low the entire time so I didn't get zone minutes or calorie burn. At this point I cut my losses and just never buy a Fitbit again.",1
0,"This review is split into two parts: one for the tracker itself and one for the app and company. My overall rating for this product is 2.5 Stars.Versa 2: 3.5 StarsI had my Versa 2 for a year and a half before it had a quick downward spiral from the touchscreen acting up a bit to completely nonfunctional within two weeks. While I am not impressed with the longevity, I found the watch to be useful and handy but also lacking for the cost. For context, I paid around $150 on a sale, and not long after I believe it went on sale for $130, but even judging by the $150 price and not the full price, it is disappointing.Pros-Tracking: For others, this may be a Con since I cannot verify how precise the tracking is, but as someone who uses it more casually, I found it to be perfectly fine. It did a reasonable job at tracking my steps, logging my exercises, and telling me how I slept.-Apps: Aside from the default apps, additional apps can be installed. You can rearrange the apps too to put the useful apps in easier access. Generally, I found it easier to use apps on my phone but some like the alarms and timers are great.-Customization: One big positive for the Versa 2 is that it is fairly customizable. It can change its clockface from a huge selection and easily swap between them. You can also swap out the watch bands.Cons-Alexa Support: This is an awesome feature in concept, but the majority of the time it failed to work. At least 4/5 times when I tried to use it, it would tell me it couldn't connect and to set it up in the app (it was already set up). It was so inconsistent that I stopped using it over more reliable means.-Bands: As nice it is to be able to change the bands, it is annoying to swap them. Other trackers like the Charge 4 can swap bands far more easily.-Interfaces: This is a more minor nitpick, but something about the look of the apps reminded me of a decade-old device rather than something modern.-Longevity: If you told me when I bought this that it would only last 1.5 years before breaking (averaging $8+ a month), I probably would have gotten something else instead. If you are used to upgrading devices often, this may not be a big deal but as someone who wanted a device for the next 3-5 years, this majorly underperformed.Fitbit: 1.5 StarsThe AppIn terms of content, the app is pretty nice. It displays the information from the tracker nicely and it lets you input additional data to track weight, food, water, and exercises. However, it has one glaring problem: connectivity. The trackers need the app to sync the data and from my experience, it likes to not do this for seemingly no reason. If you search ""Fitbit won't sync"" or look at the app reviews, you'll probably find I am not alone in this issue. Sometimes the troubleshooting like restarting Bluetooth or my phone will help but other times I can try every trick and it still won't manage to sync, then a day or two later it will start working again. At times it is so bad that I'd get my weekly report email and half the week with have nothing because it went that long without syncing. Other trackers may run into similar issues, but I don't recall it being nearly this bad with my old Fitbit One, which synced with an adapted on the desktop, so since new trackers only work with the app that seems to be at least part of the problem.The CompanyBefore the Versa 2, I had a Fitbit One that I used so much I needed my third replacement strap. To the best of my knowledge, that Fitbit One still works fine as ever. When the Blaze transition to Versa, I noticed far more negative reviews pointing out issues. I hoped the next model would be better, but the same problems seemed to persist or even gotten worse. And based on my own experiences, these new trackers do feel subpar and not as good as they used to be.After my Versa 2 broke, just after the year warranty, support did offer me a 30% discount on a new tracker through their website. Unfortunately, this didn't count for much as they'd run a sale within the week offering around 20% off. I ended up getting a Charge 4 and the tracker is pretty good, especially for what I paid, but the company stooped to a new low by dropped support for my device right after I ordered and failing to notify me, then giving me terrible support to the point it was insulting and refusing to accept any returns or offer any compensation for effectively delivering a product different to the one I ordered.Overall, I would not recommend a Fitbit. Personally, I am looking into other trackers/smartwatches, specifically Garmin. But if you want to try a Fitbit, I'd suggest a Charge or similar model over a Versa. Also, I'd look out for a sale, which tends to happen multi times a year.",2
0,"It may seem like a deal in comparison to the Apple Watch, but not if your value your time or want a product that works longer than 7 months. I have a Versa and bought my father a Versa 2. Aside from a lengthy set up, both worked great for about 5-6 months. At that point they would occasionally just switch to a different time zone. I would charge and do a a hard synch to my computer and usually it would resolve. But now neither watch keeps a charge or even reliably tells time. So not only doesn't it track steps or connect with my phone -it doesn't even tell time.I just spent 45 minutes on chat with someone in India who basically told me to clean the contact points and try restarting it. Yes, I read the help docs, I already tried that. His resolution was that at some point, someone would email me about the warranty.This is my 3rd fitbit (4th if you count the watch for my dad) I always want to believe they have figured it out because the concept is so slick and the price so attractive. Bottom line, I won't waste my money again. These are garbage and so is their support for their product.",1
0,"This is my second Fitbit / versa.... I had such high hopes. I love the look of it. I don't do some of the bells and whistles like music and all that crap. That to me is just useless to have on a watch....It feels nice, it's a great display, the button works great scrolling through what you want is easy. My biggest issue is that it is extremely inaccurate. As far as steps and counts. Way off. And I mean way off!. The Fitbit versa light was the same way. In fact we back when fitbit first came out....I had purchased one of the first couple of originals. And it was the same thing. I compare this with both my garmins that are very basic yes.... However they are both very accurate. And only changing the battery once a year sometimes a year-and-a-half actually is a huge plus. Nonetheless I wanted to try the new fitbit's out and it's nice you don't have to charge it for every 5 days. Which isn't too bad. But I can't get past the inaccuracy. I was not feeling well a couple days ago and I know for a fact I never reached my step goal but according to Fitbit I did. so then I measured it up against the two garments. Fitbit was off fitbit over a thousand! It's too bad because I really wanted to love this watch, activity tracker rather. The sleep is accurate but no more accurate than my Garmin. I was just hoping to find something with a big display it had a few more fun features. The other thing the Fitbit versa 2....It does not record flights of stairs as accurately as I hoped either. Which was my main reason for up grading from the versa light. I did 5 sets of stairs it didn't register one of them.More than likely I will be returning this item and just sticking with my Garmin. I keep trying to find a product that I might like better and that has a once-a-year replaceable battery but so far no one has come out with it. And although this is only a $200 item.... The accuracy in stepping should be far far more accurate.So if you're looking for a true fitness band because steps and fitness features are most important this is not the band. If youre just looking for a watch with some bells and whistles and an approximate tracker of your fitness? Then its ok.",2
1,"I used to have the Charge 2 and wanted a bigger screen and the ability to do more apps etc.This was on sale so I paid around $175 and got a leather strap too.I love the bigger screen, the apps I hardly use (Alexa is handy for setting timers!) but my biggest issue is the sleep app, it was great on the Charge 2 but on this Versa 2 it will count me as asleep when I'm sitting down watching tv or reading a book in bed, it is nowhere near as accurate as the Charge 2.The battery lasts a long time between charges, the screen did go black one time with the low battery and when I set it up to charge nothing happened, apparently this is common until it's been charging for a minimum 30mins so just wait! The Helpdesk were very responsive when I thought the watch had died!!So overall I like it but I don't love it.",4
0,"I've had two previous Fitbits that were very simple. They basically tracked steps, sleep, etc. When I bought the newest and much more expensive, Versa 2 last month, I was excited about what it offered. It comes with Alexa, as well as other apps. However, when I received the watch I was disappointed in things I thought it would have, but didn't, especially since it’s relatively the newest. Alexa is nice, but it's minimal for what it can do. I loved that I could set alarms on the Versa 2, but the biggest disappointed for me, is that I couldn't label the alarms (i.e. 1:45 p.m. Dr. appt., or whatever). You can only set times, but without labels to them. I have to set more than one alarm on my watch daily, and it would be nice to know that they told me what they were for. Instead, I have to try to remember/memorize what they are all for. I would think having a label for the alarm(s) would be a simple feature to add to the Versa 2. I was also excited about having music (Pandora) app. It would be nice to connect that to a bluetooth speaker, but when I wasn't able to get Pandora, I called Fitbit, and she told me it is something I have to pay extra for per month. I like being able to see texts and phone calls on my watch, but I wish I could reply to the texts by speaking into it. I know people who have Apple watches that are cheaper than what I paid for the Versa 2, and they have that feature. They are also able to label their alarms; again a HUGE (and biggest) disappointment for me. My next watch will not be the Versa 2, and wish I would have returned it sooner, before my time ran out.",2
0,"I previously had the Fitbit Inspire HR which I loved for the way that it tracked calories and I was able to lose weight. My husband then bought me a Galaxy Active 2 and I have been using it a while but it doesn't track calories as well. So I decided to go back to Fitbit because it seemed to have a better fitness app overall. Well immediately after setting it up, it kept saying it was not connected to the internet even though I was right next to the router. Apparently this is a common issue because I found a lot of forums for troubleshooting. The reason I am going to be returning it is that the text notifications will not work at all. Phone call notifications will only work if your ringer is on (the Galaxy Active 2 will vibrate if the ringer is off). Overall the Galaxy does have a lot better features and customization.",1
0,I have NOT been able to receive texts at all. I bought this Fitbit Versa 2 after MUCH deliberation over this vs Apple Watch. I sooooo regret my purchase. After SEVERAL contacts with Fitbit support (after exhausting my troubleshooting research) they finally admit that there is a problem with *some* Fitbit’s receiving texts and that I must await some future update. I was assured their tech people are working on a solution (apparently have been for months) but no timeframe was given for a fix. I JUST missed the return window (Jan 31) and now my birthday present to myself is just a watch.Sooooo frustrating! THINK TWICE BEFORE TAKING A CHANCE ON FITBIT.,1
1,"This was an impulse buy, something I don’t normally do. But I’m so glad I did. I already had an Inspire HR and it was still working great and was in great condition but for some reason, all of a sudden, I wanted the bigger screen. So without reading any reviews (also something out of the ordinary for me, I obsess over reviews), I bought this. It is wonderful, the screen is large and colorful. I have had no problems syncing it to my phone. I’ve found it to be accurate. I absolutely recommend this Fitbit. On a side note, I attribute Fitbit in general to my overall health and fitness. Since I’ve started using a Fitbit, I’ve been much more active and I’ve been able to hold myself accountable for my activities. It encourages me to set goals for myself and to make sure I’m getting a certain amount of steps, active minutes, and making sure I’m up at least for 250 steps every hour. If you’re new to the Fitbit idea, I can say it really is helpful. And good luck on your fitness and health journey!",5
1,"Not impressed. If this is your first Fitbit watch maybe you will enjoy it? I ordered this for myself for Christmas from my husband to give to me thinking it would be a fun and useful watch with the bigger face than my Charge 2 watch. Even though the face is bigger and you can see a lot of info on the clock screen you can also find the same info in the app when you sync a watch like Charge 2 to it. The exercises like run, swim, etc are something I don’t do everyday. The apps are kind of useless to me. The notifications for text are for Android phones only another bummer. Again it’s a great watch if it’s your first Fitbit and you want to see more on the screen and if you have an Android phone for the texting. But to be honest I like my elegant Charge 2 style and simplicity better that shows the basics I need on my watch and everything that’s important to me in the app like the calories burned, miles walked, my sleep, heart rates, etc that syncs with the Carb Manager app I use to show me how many calories I can deduct from my caloric intake. Like another reviewer said Fitbit is trying to be like an Apple Watch I Also believe it’s true.",3
1,"I own a Blaze and a GalaxyNote8. When I tried to set up the new Versa 2 I just purchased, the app takes me back to the account screen. I called support and was told the Versa 2 has 'not been tested for my phone. Is there any thing else I can help you with?' This is a new watch that doesn't work with Samsung Note 8. Fitbit needs to do the work before launching its products. UPDATE: I've upgraded from 1 star to 3. I uninstalled my fitbit app and reinstalled. This allowed me to setup the new Versa 2 with my Samsung Note8. Tech support needs a refresher course on their new products.",3
1,"I love this FitBit! Battery power for me lasts 4 to 5 days. Waterproofing is incredible! I have worn it in lakes, showers and baths with no issues whatsoever. Sleep tracking and period tracking (ladies i am talking to you) is incredible. It predicts cycles based off of body temp which is incredible to me because it works! I am v irregular and it is able to tell me when my period will start even when it is not in the regular pattern. It learns about your sleep and body cycles and helps you keep track. I love it!!",5
1,"Bought MAY 2020 so have had a year of experience with the watch. Have to trust that it is accurate.Positives1- Looks good on my wrist. The square design is better than my Round Motorola IMHO. And it quickly shows the correct time whether you use the always on feature or the flick of the wrist feature (my choice).2- Comfortable enough to wear 24/7 (except when charging)3- Multiple faces to choose from and are easy to read indoors and outdoors.4- Most important is the Sleep Analysis feature. From amount of REM, Deep, and Light Sleep to Resting Heart Rate and Oxygen Level Variation, the watch is worth it for that feature alone.5- Lots and Lots of features like Music, Spotify, Relax, Pandora, Wallet that I usually just use my phone for since I have it with me the same amount of time as the watch.6- Nice to have the watch buzz and display who is calling when you have a call during a meeting so you can quickly see if it's important7- Continual Heart Rate Monitoring - An important feature if you even have a remote heart problem.8- Physical fitness stats to give you a quick view of how many steps you've taken, stairs you've climbed, etc., and a reminder if you've been sitting too long.9- Phone App gives you a vast amount of data on health and exercise.10- Better way to charge the watch than my previous Blaze Fitbit.11- Access can be protected with a four digit code.12- A ""Find my phone"" app. How many time do you lay the phone down at home and forget where it is?Negatives-1- Although Fitbit adds features to the Watch and App (Health Metrics, for example), they collect a lot more data and will only show it to you if you pay a monthly fee for Premium. That should be included when you buy the watch. It's your body's data!!2- Alexa can't be set to your at-home name. Nice to have an Alexa connection, but not all that useful.3- Not a problem for me, but for those who like to change watch straps, it doesn't look easy. Haven't tried it since I had a Blaze.4- Too many apps that are really better on my Android phone.This has been a great watch to have during a pandemic to keep an eye on things like Oxygen Levels and other health measurements. But in other matters, it is an accessory to your phone, not a replacement for it.Personally, I've grown to rely on my Versa 2 to make sure I'm getting enough sleep and exercise and to monitor critical values like heart rate and Oxygen levels. If that's what you want, this is the watch for you at a ""decent"" price. If not, check out the Versa 3. It might be worth spending the extra money but I'll stick with this one until it falls off of my wrist.Stay well and safe!",5
1,"Just recieved this today, so the review is only after wearing for about 3 hours. So far this tracker is great! The Alexa integration is seamless with a simple Amazon login through the Fitbit App. The voice control is smooth with no lag, just as if I was talking to one of my existing Alexa devices already in my house. The display is great and it seems to be picking up my motions and steps accurately.The only reason I left off a star is for the wrist band. While it's not terrible, it's your usual run of the mill band, that seems pretty thin, and with a decent amount of activity and wear, will likely need replaced with something more sturdy. Overall so far the device has not disappointed!***UPDATE*** I'm going into day 5 of wearing this. When I first took it out of the box, the battery was at 73%. I didnt charge it before puting it on, and have yet to charge it. So for BATTERY LIFE it is SOLID! Starting day 5 with 21% battery remaining. I'm active all day every day, have it monitoring heart rate, recieving quite a bit of notifications which I frequently use the watch to reply to. Use alexa several times a day, and it's still holding this level of battery.",4
1,"I got this in January 2020. The screen ""locked"" that April; couldn't get it to do anything. No buttons, touches, or swipes worked. Called Fitbit and they sent me a replacement for free. That one worked until December 2021 where during the middle of an exercise-bike ride, it gave me an error message with a big red X. I called Fitbit and they walked me through an entire reset. That worked, but it didn't record my 45-minute bike ride. The next day I noticed it was low on a charge; now it needs to be charged EVERY DAY. I don't have all-day display on, I only have it activate when I tap the screen or push the side button, the screen timeout is only 10 seconds. There's no reason it should need charging every day! I'm frustrated because it wasn't cheap and the warranty is only 1 year. Am I supposed to buy one of these every year? I researched alternatives like Garmin and Samsung smartwatches, and their warranty is only a year as well. I really don't like the idea of having to buy a new one of these annually. Not sure I'll replace it with another Fitbit; seems like planned obsolescence. When it works, it's a great little device, but it just doesn't work long enough for the price.",3
1,"Pros:Loooong battery life and fast charging. I charge it at work for about an hour every few days.Alexa, I can set routines for the watch that work with all of my other devices.Small enough for my tiny wrist. But big enough to use easily.No issues with it staying connected to my phone, even from other areas of my 1300sqf house.Tons of watch face options, many of which are free.Water resistant. I can keep it on while helping my kids wash their hair (now that I have a new band. see cons).Cons:Odd charger design. If you put on a protective case, it has to be taken off the watch for charging.Silicone band. I HATE the band. It holds moisture against the skin and gave me a blister. Terrible choice for a fitness watch that is expected to get damp at times.Like many standard watch bands, the silicone band had a setting that was too tight, and one that was too loose, with nothing in between.I bought a new band.",4
0,This watch is horrible. Let me clarify.. The watch itself is very nice and is extremely comfortable to wear.. That's where the positives end. Nothing ever works. Constantly saying it can not find device and 9 times out of 10 Alex isn't working. I read all the things you should do to fix these problems Too many to list. Why on earth should I have to do any of them. I had the previous Versa and didn't have all these problem. Waste of money..,1
0,"I'll be honest, I liked my FitBit Versa2 while it was working. Then, after about 10 months of use - it stopped. But no worries - it is still under warranty, yay! Boy was I wrong. Here is a quick timeline of the warranty process:November 25: Contact FitBit support because the watch would not turn on.November 25-28, attempt multiple troubleshooting exercises.November 28: receive a label to return the broken watch for warranty replacement.December 6: Ship broken watch back for warranty return (upon return from vacation).December 6 - January 2: wait for a replacement.January 2: Find out replacement is also broken - spend the day with Customer support chat only to be told that I'd have pay to send the 2nd broken watch back.So, here I am, 38 days after initial support contact about to return my 2nd watch (the same day I received it). I'm hopeful, but not confident that it will take less than a month to get the 3rd watch.Honestly - I have already moved on to an Apple Watch and have enjoyed that immensely for the past month. This FitBit will eventually go to my daughter, assuming it works.",1
0,"Cons: So Alexa is what they advertise with for this model. She is pretty much useless. I wasn't able to find anything she can do except saying ""I didn't get that"", ""I don't know this "", ""Thete is no news on this"" or the weather. Although she isn't always able to show a forecast either. She varies between Fahrenheit and Celsius and even though my phone (which is synchronized to her via the app) I has a turned on GPS she stopped using the right place for forecasts after a couple of days. Then she would automatically use a village that is about 4 miles from where I grew up in Germany (never went there since I have a phone) even though I bought the watch in the US and it has never been in Germany with me. Pretty ridiculous and super annoying.The sleep tracker sometimes doesn't track when you sleep or it thinks you sleep when you're lying down to watch a show or snooze/doze in the morning when you sleep in. Luckily, you can manually delete this though.When you work out it will often think it is Aerobics (happened when I was dancing in a bar as well as for martial arts). If it doesn't realize you're doing a workout it counts the active minutes (realizes that by heart beat) but when you add a workout for that time the active minutes get deleted and you might end up with 0 active minutes for that day. When you add a workout manually you have to add the calories manually which I feel is kinda not the point.The food tracking or rather the statement of calories you have left doesn't make much sense either, at least the calories in and out part which is why I haven't really been using it since it is just weird.I can't synchronize it in a way that I could use timers etc. on the watch.Not really good designs available for free but the orginal fitbit one is, so you could go with that. They let you try the ones you need to buy for a day though.I bought a pack of designs for $10 but afterwards they didn't show anywhere in the spot where you chose your design. I just got shown the one I had tried because that was already saved with my favorites. The other24 don't show and I don't know where to find them to use them. Wasted money again.Pros: Pretty color and watch seems high quality. Not a plastic but actual glass display. The showing of the sleep score and oxygen concentration is a great feature, especially for the sleep phases and the possible comparisons to your usual length of each phase and the average for your age and gender.The floor and step counter mostly works well too and I like that it shows how far you've walked with that and your burned calories and the heart beat plus your average resting heart beat.All in all: it has many great features but next time I would get the version without Alexa and always try to get it discounted because like this it's not really worth the money.EDIT:I edited my rating to 1 star because it keeps not synchronizing properly even though ""All-Day-Synch"" is turned on. Wore it for a run for the first time and even though GPS to track the trail on a map is activated there is no chance to see a map or pace. All it shows is heart rate and the way of energy use (cardio, fat burn, peak), duration, calories and steps. I was really looking foward to seeing a map with pace and distance but nope.Also, I found out I can't connect it to my whatsapp to see my messages on the watch.Guess an apple watch would have been a better choice. This device is not worth more than maybe 50-70 bucks. So I can not, in any case recommend it. I'm sorry.Edit after 4 months: Broken, watch display doesn't light up anymore, only the other tabs when you swipe - not the watch face",1
1,"If you dont need a phone on your wrist and you want something that looks decent, has decent battery life (not 1day like smarter competitors) good build quality and does the basics like health/ sleep tracking, Alexa voice assistant, notifications including reply and some more basic apps then you will be happy with this product.PROS:-Alexa works well and can be used to control many smart devices.-Battery life is very decent considering you can last for around 5 days with continous hrm and a good amount of notifications. Most of the more advanced smart watches will last half of that.-Looks nice and build quality is also good-Slim profile and comfortable to sleep with.-Cheaper than any other smart watch which can be called a smart watch (has an app store and can reply to notifications)-Excellent fitness featuresCONS:-Navigating through the menus can be choppy from time to time, not as smooth and as nice looking as some other more expensive products (guess its cause of the lower spec hence better battery life)-Not as smart as something like Wear OS, Gear or Apple watch... number of apps much lower and quality not as good.-Under sleep monitoring ""Sleeping Heart Rate"" is locked and requires premium subscription-Spotify just remote not the full app, adding music is clumsy.",4

0,"Stay away from this if you really accurate calorie data. This watch is counting calories even you're not wearing the watch. It is estimating your calories burned based on your personal information to set the watch up with. That is simple false because your heart rate isn't the same at all times and assuming the watch knows how many calorie you burned is getting you nowhere. You need to know exactly in order to adjust your calorie intake. I've contacted the Fitbit support and they told me that this watch has no option to disable the estimated calories burned. So in order to get sort of an idea, even if the data is wrong, you'd have to wear this watch throughout the night. Otherwise you'll be waking up looking at calories burned without having done a thing. In my humble opinion this far from the reason why you want to buy this watch. I am actually being lied to in a way and I am not paying for receiving false and incorrect information. So I will happily return it and will go with an Apple watch that is proven to be 90% accurate. If you look up the accuracy of Fitbit versa 2 you'll find things ""50% accurate ""most"" of the time. I hope this will help anyone to make the right decision on what to buy.",2
1,"I bought this to replace my Fitbit Blaze. I like the display and the silent alarms, but the heart rate monitor is inaccurate during intensive workouts and the sleep tracker doesn’t work well.I am able to cross check my pulse on the elliptical and the Versa 2 is way off, sometimes displaying a pulse of 150’s when I’m in a recovery period and it is actually around 120.The sleep tracker just doesn’t recognize my sleep about every 4th night. I’ve tried moving the band, making it looser and tighter.I was also unable to transfer my exercise playlist on iTunes to the Versa 2, even after using all the tips in the database and chatting in real time with a Fitbit rep.It still works as a watch and step tracker, but for the price it should be more functional. I’ll get the Apple Watch next time.",3
0,Multiple people reporting the screen stops responding to touch screen. I have a hard case on my watch after getting a scratch the 1st day I got this. 15 months later the screen just stops responding. I call customer service they have me factory reset which of coarse does nothing. They tell me my warranty is up and offer a 25% off discount to buy a new Fitbit. I work in IT and I will tell you if you're using an outside developer application the screen will work all other attempts will not register. That's a software issue. I'll never purchase another Fitbit. My buddy got a cheap smart watch at half the price and it is still working with no issues. Of coarse now that google has taken over Fitbit issues happen right when the warranty expired,1
0,"My Fitbit Versa 2 broke last week, at just over one year old. The face came apart from the watch and it no longer works. I called customer service three days ago, and then sent an email with photos and the case number. I've yet to get any kind of response, even just to acknowledge receipt of my email. Still waiting. It worked great up until that point, but three days and no response is ridiculous. Might be moving to a competitor.Update: After a week with no response, I called the company again. The agent was very friendly and helpful. However, the company only offered me a 35% discount on another Fitbit device. Again, it was just over one year old and it broke. I wore it daily, regular use, no unusual activity. So, it was just outside the warranty. I am now going to a competitor. A product that breaks after one year of intended use is not a stellar product.",1
0,"Right away I had issues with my Versa 2 syncing to my phone. I researched it, and I'm not alone. I did the chat thing with Fitbit and was told to go through all the various processes of rebooting the watch and phone to make them ""see"" each other and though that may help temporarily, I refuse to go through a dozen trouble-shooting steps every time the watch won't sync.So I decided to use the watch for the month I was allowed from Amazon before the return window expired. EVERY morning the Versa 2 refused to sync to my phone, until I left my house, when it would then finally sync. So obviously there was some kind of bluetooth conflict with another device in my home. Again, this is something Fitbit should have figured out before the product went to market.Now at the end of my first month of ownership, the barometric sensor has failed and the device can no longer see when I climb stairs.For $200 Fitbit should be able to do better. Maybe now that Google owns them things will improve. Returning for refund.",2
1,"I got my Versa 2 directly from Fitbit, on sale for just under $150 plus tax. I was upset when a few days later, I saw it at Costco for just under $140. But that is not why I gave it a mixed review.It looks a lot better than my Surge, looking more like a real watch. It also has a greater variety of clock faces (most of which you have to pay for). The battery is excellent. It tracks sleep about as well as my Surge. I checked my average O2 a few times and it would sometimes give me a reading. As to it having Alexa and being able to hold some music, my cell phone is a lot more convenient for both, and holds a lot more music.However, the touch screen would work sometimes and not others. I would often tap, double tap with nothing happening only to have to push the sole button on the Versa to get something to happen. Other times the touchscreen would work fine. I often use a timer for certain exercises I do. The Surge's timer vibrates for a few seconds, then shuts off. The Versa 2 keeps vibrating until you manually shut it off (an inconvenience if you want to hold a stretch a bit longer). I can stop and start music and podcasts on my cell phone with my Surge, something I was unable to do with the Versa 2. One other problem is that you can set it to vibrate at certain intervals as you walk/run; however my Versa 2 would vibrate often on my walks, totally unrelated to distance traveled. So that feature was worthless. (My Surge only vibrates every half mile - I know exactly why it is doing it. After giving my Versa 2 a one month try, I ended up sending it back, within the 45 days Fitbit allows, having to pay only the just under 6 dollar shipping charge.I plan on using my Surge until it dies, despite its chunkiness and weakening battery.",3
1,"I ordered this fitbit and started using it yesterday. No matter what I do, I cant get it to receive texts. I did all of the troubleshooting that I could find on the internet. I finally contacted fitbit themselves. They went through the same troubleshooting things with me that I had already done. They basically told me its an issue with my phone update vs their fitbit software. I have a Samsung galaxy s10e. Its not an old phone. I didn't think there would be an issue. So the support guy from fitbit said I wont receive texts on my fitbit until they figure out what the problem is and there is an update, hopefully fixing the issue. This is very frustrating since I bought this with the notion that it would receive text notifications since the description of the product says that it does. It does has a lot of other cool features though. It will receive notifications for snapchat, FB, my spotify works.. would be amazing it the texts came through as well!!",3
0,"I really liked the watch while it worked. That is a month and a half. Everything good that people wrote in their reviews is mostly true. But now I find myself with an expensive watch that is no good. It self resets 5-20 times a day. It is often unresponsive to any action, push the button, swipe in any direction, move your wrist - you name it - it’s not working most of the time. My guess that it should not be worn in water. They say you may, you should be able to swim in it, just dry it completely after. I did. Now it’s glitching all the time. Will try to replace it. My husband does not wear his fitbit versa in the water and it works fine. Except for sleep tracking which does not work. So I hope to get a replacement. Will not swim in it. But still I plan to workout in it, otherwise what’s the point? And it means sweat. We’ll see if the sweat is also a challenge...",1
1,"I was excited to try this after I briefly tried the Apple Watch 3. Unfortunately, I hate iPhone and my Apple Watch obviously could not be used with my Samsung Galaxy. So after months of reviews, I decided to get the Fitbit Versa 2 while on sale.Outside, it is beautiful. However, features are lacking. I was very disappointed with the lack of Apps for a smart watch.Messaging works well, and Alexa is great with typing replies. However, Alexa is overall useless for anything else.If you have an iPhone, get the Apple Watch.I'm only keeping it for the step count and because it's cute. I could've just gotten the Charge 4 for 30 dlls less but figured I'd get the Versa 2 since it is supposed to have more features.If you're on the fence between Charge 4 and Versa 2,maybe just get the Charge 4.Also, the band has given me a rash twice in the 3 weeks I've had it. I noticed I got the rash when I wear it slightly tighter. I live in Houston TX so it is very hot and humid, likely get the rash from the friction and humidity. So don't wear it too tight.Unsure on the effect of this on body measurements.",3
1,I was very happy with this device and I would have kept it but I had to agree with my husband the features it was missing were too important with me riding my horses alone more and more.What it doesn't have that I needed (these details were difficult to find in research; one review/article would tell you one thing and a different the other)1. Doesn't have fall detect2. It doesn't make or receive calls or texts without your phone being near by and connected.3. Access to an app or have a horse riding option in the exercises.Things I liked.+ I only had to charge it every other day. Sometimes I would make it to the 3rd day.+ All the options to be able to make it your own with your style and likes (bands and accessories)+ RoadID makes a slip on that fits+ The charging stand that held my phone too (optional accessory for extra)+ Simplicity of the app and how to get everything set up and going.How well it tracked things and how easy it is to keep all my health & wellness information together. I really liked the Premium upgrade and using the sleep program; sleeping isn't something I do well and this helped me remember what to do.You can track your food with the watch although it was a little clumsy. I usually just tracked it on the app and really went back to using MyFitnessPal and linked my fitbit to that so I could have it upload my fitness stuff.In the end for the money you spend you get the bang for your buck. It just was a level below what I needed for my safety. I felt it was an amazing product that I ended gifting it to a friend who was diagnosed with a big diagnoses (needing to track her stats on an hourly/30 minute basis) and I knew it would help her immensely! And for what she needs it is perfect and working so very well!,4
0,"After being a longtime Fitbit user (since 2014), I had decided to upgrade my Versa lite, but all of the features I purchased this one for either doesn't work or requires a ""premium subscription"". Any of the music streaming apps require the paid subscriptions, and of course the one I do pay for doesn't have an app for this. The Fitbit app wont update nor will it let me download additional apps to this device. After doing a ton of research it seems Fitbit says they are aware of the problem but has taken on a 'too bad so sad' 'we don't know when we can fix it' attitude towards it. Poor customer service Google/Fitbit. I'm returning my new Versa 2. I guess I'll use my Versa Lite until it dies and then will be switching to another brand.",2

I've enjoyed the competition their devices inspire.Upgraded to Versa 2 from charge 2.This device had been nothing sorry if frustrating and disappointing.The GPS doesn't consistently work. Whether I start it from the device OR the app, it doesn't create the map or track my activity.I had a problem with the device not tracking floors - I believe that's resolved, but hard to tell really.My consistent issue has been unresponsiveness to tapping and swyping. Fitbit asked me for a VIDEO of this issue! Ok, I can play IT games, my husband and I captured the video and emailed it. No response.At first I believed I ended up with a ""lemon."" But, after taking to Twitter - seems there is a known issue.I'm not above returning the device.OH, yesterday my battery was at 100% today it's dropped to 58%.I'm not playing music through it, not receiving texts, email or calendar events. Essentially, not using any of the extras.I cannot recommend this device.",2
0,"This is my FOURTH Fitbit WITHIN A YEAR. I'm so fed up with it. The watch itself would be fine if not for the stupid app. It doesn't sync properly and is so buggy that it's unusable. My first Fitbit (Versa Lite) just stopped working after the battery died and wouldn't charge. I bought a Versa 2 and it worked for a month; I woke up from a nap and it just stopped working with a full battery and would only function on the charger. I couldn't change the watch face or get any apps because it just would constantly say the download failed. Got a replacement and within an hour and doing NOTHING with the watch, it went from 75% to 24%. The watch faces and apps wouldn't download AGAIN so my watch just said ""error"". PLEASE save your money and get a Garmin or Samsung.",1
1,"A handy product but it has some downsides. It advertises you can use certain apps if you buy it. But you cannot use certain apps without premium subscriptions to the apps. I was looking forward to using the Spotify app with my Fitbit. Spotify can be used free when you download their app. But on Fitbit you can only use Spotify if you have the premium subscription to Spotify. Well, I'm not buying a premium subscription for an app that I can use for free everywhere else. And it would be nice to be able to use the music apps that I do have subscriptions to like Amazon Music. Good for keeping track of steps and heartbeat. Good at keeping you motivated to stay active.",5
0,"Skip Fitbit!! Fitbit absolutely refuses to back there products! Purchased the Versa 2, and for 3 months worked great! Loved Alexa, tracking, watch faces, etc. Then the Versa microphone quite working. Contacted Fitbit support, multiple levels of support, and was told they will not warranty the product.Why? Because the phone I primarily use is ""not approved"" (by the way, that list of ""approved"" phones is short if you don't use Apple).Independently tested Versa on iPhone 11 (officially supported phone), and microphone still doesn't work. Does it matter to Fitbit- nope!This is the 3rd Fitbit I've owned in 4 years. It will also be my last Fitbit I will buy. My first Fitbit lasted for 4 years. The Versa 2 lasted for about 3 months before the biggest feature (the microphone for Alexa) stopped working. Fitbit is making cheaper garbage, and selling it for more, while refusing to provide warranty support. I'm tired of dealing subpar products with horrible service.

I plugged the device into the charger and nothing happened. The charger is fine but the watch will not charge. I called the help desk for assistance. After trying everything they recommended I was told they would give me 35 % discount. This is so disappointing. It is ridiculous that a watch lasts only one year.

0,"Purchased this in November 2019. It's now 2 years later and the thing is barely functioning. I will never be purchasing a fitbit product again after this experience. Where shall I start?First off, the side button stopped working after about 8 months. So that's great, using the watch was that much more difficult.Second, the battery life went downhill fast. When I first purchased the watch it could go over a week without needing to be charged (with the always on display turned off). However, it now can't even to two days without needing to be charged. Quite a joke.Third, the wristband broke after a year. Bought a new one which is much nicer but still a waste. Fourth, the heart rate monitor broke and no longer worked after around a year.TLD; I spent 150 dollars (on sale) for an ugly looking watch that works as an alarm clock and that's it. Don't purchase this product.",1
0,"DO NOT BUY THIS MODEL. I got the versa 2 in April 2020 after my versa one died. A few months later the touch screen aspect started to act up, followed all the suggested steps to fix it and then the watch started overheating to the point where it burnt my skin and had to be placed in my freezer to cool off. I called into FitBit and was advised to send both the watch face and charger to FitBit for them to fix it. The rep stated that once the watch was received I would be contacted with an estimated date of delivery back to me. Weeks went by (which I assumed was normal due to COVID delays) and nothing. Reviewed the tracking and the watch had been delivered a week an a half before but no contact. I understand it was during a pandemic and things would be delayed but when I called FitBit the rep stated the watch had not been received (as I was looking at a confirmed delivery with the tracking information FitBit provided) I’m usually pretty understanding of communication disconnects between departments but the fact that I had a confirmed delivery showing with the tracking provided was a bit off. In addition my account did not show the charger as needing to be returned and there was no record to backup my claim that that was what I was told to send back. Went back and forth for over an hour with a rep and I wound up having to escalate the situation so I could finally get an approval for a new watch face and charger to be sent to me. I received my watch and charger back the beginning of September after a month and a half of it being without use. And now after only 2.5 months the same issues are starting again.. It is basically just a watch that appears to have great added perks but I can’t even end an exercise to track it accurately bc the top right corner is not detecting touch but will randomly allow a swiping motion.",1

1,LOVE IT! Easy to set up. Connected to my phone and my apps easy peasy. Haven’t tested out many workout options yet but so far so good! Lots of options for clock faces too!,5
1,"Fitbit is an amazing device and it helps you stay health conscious daily. If you're competitive like I am, it gives you that boost to keep at it. What's even more fun is trying to beat your previous score or trying to beat your friends scores. The challenges with groups are a lot of fun too!App: The app is awesome. It has amazing tracking features, and easy to understand logs. (Sleep, food etc) it also has pretty cool clock faces.Bonus! If you have a premium it makes the app/watch even more special. I can't really comment on the free side of it since I haven't tried the free. I instantly got Premium; it is worth it.The app itself has amazing mindful prompts and videos to listen to whenever you need them.There are groups to join in areas that interest you. It's very social; you can chat, post & share your stats and more to a wall timeline. You can meet others like yourself and do fun challenges.Fitbit band Watch Face: The band is comfortable. So far the band hasn't given me any irritation.Update: band did cause irritation so I ended up buying canvis bands which is much better on my skin.The screen is bright and clear. I would say the accuracy on this watch is ""eh"". It's okay, so you'll have to give it a little estimation here and there. Sometimes it gives a lot more steps than you should have. If you want 100% accuracy, this isn't it nor is it perfect. Like pretty much all the other trackers, I'm sure there are better fitness watches on the market. So don't go into this thinking it's the best accuracy tracker ever...it's not...I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND buying a screen protector. This screen scratches easily! I'm not even kidding here. Invest in a screen protector as soon as you buy this. I'm very careful with my things especially if I invest this much money into it. So, to my surprise, I woke up and there were small tiny scratches on my screen. Small deep little scratches. Freaking out eternally trying to figure out HOW!? 🤦🏻‍♀️ So you need to protect the screen.So far that is my only issue with this Fitbit.Except the color, I'm not fond of the deep plum color. But that's a personal opinion. But that's okay I'll buy new bands.Would I recommend it? Yes and no, I'm hoping maybe with an update on the software might help with the step count accuracy. But I'm not holding my breath on that anytime soon. If you work a lot and work a very physical job. I wouldn't recommend this unless you have a screen protector!Pros:*Encouragement to stay health conscious*Pretty simple to use*Has amazing guides and etc*Comfortable to wear; even at night*Cool clock faces*Alexa seems to work without issuesCons:*Screen scratches VERY easily*Accuracy is off A lot!*I have a few issues with it syncing properly*Battery definitely doesn't last more than 2 days. That with dim to low brightness and not a lot of use on the watch itself.I will update later if there are any changes.",4
1,"I was very impressed with this watch at first. It has a great look, the app shows activity and sleep in nice graphs, and it even has a music app on the watch (in addition to Spotify and Deezer) that connects to headphones from the watch's bluetooth. Pretty impressive until you realize you can't download the desktop app required or how to get your files on it. Tech support was absolutely useless. I knew more about the watch than he did. He actually told me there was no music app (while I was in it) and that Spotify was the only way to get music on it. So a simple search yielded the simple instructions of where the app is and so I installed it and it worked great! But the sleep monitor didn't care if you got up for an hour and went back to bed ... your sleep time was whatever time it decided you went to bed until you got out of bed. For me, totally useless. It's a nice watch, but I wouldn't recommend it. I sent it back where it came from :)",3

0,Well I got this as a gift Christmas 2019. I used it for 2020. Clearly not a year where anyone did much.. It would drop Bluetooth I'd reconnect a little annoying. Then it wouldn't always connect charging. If this happens immediately call. I thought maybe it just needed a cleaning. Wrong...now it won't charge it just gets hot. I see some water in it just coming out of winter clearly have not been swimming. I called sat on phone. Then had to wait for an email. Apparently they can't do anything its past the warranty. At first I thought I had this longer but looking at my purchase date now it a little over a year. The best they can do is a 35% discount. I'm not sure I want to repurchase a product that last barley over 1 year. Disappointing.,1

I liked the sleep monitoring features with the oxygen readings since I sleep with a CPAP machine.Well, about 6 months into having the Fitbit, the display went ""Poltergeist"" on me and I could not see any info except through the Fitbit App. Fitbit replaced the Versa 2 without wanting the original one.The second Versa 2 worked like the first and was fine until about 7 months later the ""Poltergeist"" screen returned. I contacted the insurance company since I purchased the insurance and it was past the year warranty from Fitbit.I sent off the Versa 2 to get repaired and then received it back where it worked good just as it had originally did until about 3 months later the screen completely black out and would not work again.That's where I called it quits with Fitbit. That is the reason I only have three stars since the main component, the screen, gave out so quickly is unacceptable. I will never buy another Fitbit again. I will be going to either a Samsung or Garmin.",3

Period.2) Because I have an artificially low heart rate, Fitbit thinks I am super fit and wants me to raise my heart even more than the average 72 year old, which is unattainable.They will NOT honor the warranty, to me it is broken because they disabled a feature I bought it for. They do not agree.This will be my last Fitbit purchase unless they make a correction.You are unable to write a review unless you are an authenticated purchase so I am guessing that many many people are not happy with this latest update, want to alert potential buyers and are unable to because they did not purchase through Amazon.",1

Both Amazon and FitBit should be ashamed of themselves--the information about this product doesn't clearly mention this fundamental change in the FitBit cost model...all of the other FitBits I've owned never required a monthly service subscription. This is where the value proposition fails.So long FitBit.One of these days when I just can't take it any more, I'll post a video of fixing their subscription services with a large hammer.

So I can't rate that part of the watch, but I wish that Amazon music was included. Why wouldn't it be, since this has Alexa?The sleep tracking is neat, it tells me how long I spent awake, in REM, light sleep, and deep sleep. It also gives me a sleep score which always falls into the ""fair"" and ""good"" range for me. I have yet to see what the best score is called, maybe one day! If you use the app to select ""go to sleep"" it will not give you a sleep score. If you do nothing and just go to bed, it will.The activity tracking is the best part I think. If you have your phone on you, it will use GPS to track runs, walks, and bike rides. GPS uses data. If you don't have your phone, it'll still tell you how many miles you did, and your pace, but there will be no map. It also tells you if you're in the cardio or fat burning zone, based on your heart rate. And it tells you the amount of calories you burned.The text feature is neat too. You can receive and read texts as long as your phone is in the room. You can also reply using voice which is a feature I use often.The band sucks, I removed a star for that reason. After 3 days of wearing this I broke out in painful blisters on my wrist. I ordered a cheapie fabric band, and have been wearing it without issue. I may save the silicone band for the pool or something, but I will never wear it continuously again.The O2 reader only estimates your levels after you've slept, it's not a good replacement for the finger readers which are more accurate.",4
0,"Very upsetting that within the first few days of having the device it turned out to be a lemon. I charged it completely the first time and it was good. The set up was very frustrating and not very simple to do, so I needed to watch Youtube videos. Then once the battery died the first time within a few days, it would no longer take a charge or turn on. I looked up the issue and found that this is a very common issue. Many people was resolved with a hard or soft reset. Problem was that my device was completely dead. I held down the buttons for over a minute and I got a response and then it said the battery was 98%. By the morning it was completely off again. Everything is connected by the app. The device does not have a speaker and cannot take calls, it only shows notifications from your phone. Setting up the SoundCloud has also been a hassle. I will be returning. I trusted this device more by the reviews, however I will be returning and getting a real smart watch for the price that was paid.",1
0,Don't bother with anything Fitbit. Their stuff used to be good. But the last few tracker purchases and a scale purchase - these things stopped functioning in less than a year. I loved my Versa 2 when it arrived. It worked great for many months. At the 9 month mark it started glitching. First the sensors stopped working. I did a factory reset. That worked. Now the screen is glitching. I'm seriously disappointed and will no longer be investing in the FitBit brand. Shame on you FitBit - is it cheap parts? Shoddy workmanship? Poor design? Some combination of these?,1
0,"Update 3-2-21The screen wouldn't accept touches around the top, or would do it intermittently. A few days later and now the touch screen won't work at all. So 1.5 years in and my $200 ""smart"" watch is only a watch with more on the display. I'll try another brand next time.------------------------------This is my first smart watch ever. I never preorder but decided to after reading a cnet article on versa2 and many articles that compared smart watches. The watch I'm sure is fine but the app is terrible. It wouldn't connect to let me create an account and kept saying the network was down. There is no documentation with the watch other than ""download the app"" and ""how to change bands"". I turned it on by holding down the one button but all it did was flash through languages saying to use the app. Which means it's completely worthless if the app doesn't work.-----The Bad----As I was trying to set it up I was ready to give it 1 star and wondering if I would have to return it as a paper weight. Once it finally let me join and login each page was terribly slow to load. It literally took 2 HOURS to make an account, update versa2, get it synced to my phone, and a few other basic things.Does it track steps or movement? Given that it's on your arm logic says the only way for it to track steps is based on moving your arm. However one moves their arm for many reasons. Getting ready in the morning and only walking through 2 rooms to do so it already had me at 400 steps for the day. Brushing my hair, pressing the tv remote, or other such tasks is not steps. It also auto logged me using the riding lawn mower as 30 minutes of bike riding. Pretty sure it doesn't burn the same calories so I'll be looking to see if the auto feature can be turned off. It lacks skating as an exercise so I'll have to choose something close.-----The Good----Once it finally got going it seems to be a nice piece of tech. Like a little phone on your arm but less features. It has tons of clock faces which each have a small cost, but will let you trial it.Still testing out the battery life. I am not using the always on and it used maybe 10% in 15 hours so it's looking good. I did not want a watch that had to be charged every day. It has a little charger it easily snaps into but the cord is very short and barely reaches my dresser.The heart rate monitor keeps up and appears to work well.It's also waterproof which is one reason I bought it.Played iheartradio on my phone with bluetooth headphones and the watch did control the volume.The sleep tracker appears to work as intended. There is no saying how accurate it is without a sleep study but it had me awake for 1 hour out of 8. It did take a while for me to fall asleep and I wake up many times during the night.I didn't see the point of a calorie tracker because I thought it had to all be entered manually and was just a digital notebook. However it has a barcode scanner so I was able to easily scan almost all of my meals for the day. Then it imported them to show an overview of calories and % of carbs, fat, protein.Did a manual start for the eliptical so that was recorded right.-----Other Thoughts----This is only day 3 with it and I'll update this as needed.In the food logger app you can click each item to see expanded nutrition. It would be great if we could see that totaled for the day instead of only calories. Such as total carbs, protein, potassium, sodium, sugar, ect.You can disable each ""auto exercise"" type so it doesn't log mowing for example. You can also change the minutes required before it logs them with a min of 10 minutes.It tracked a step for stepping into the tub so I was impressed with that. Then I went down my 5 porch steps and it didn't track it.",1
0,"I've had this watch for about two years. I like that it tracks fitness and that I can be alerted to incoming phone calls while working. The notification of calls is the most important feature to me - it eases my mind with kids in daycare that I'll know when the school is calling me even if my phone is in my bag. In the beginning the watch was great. However, recently this watch is AWFUL at staying synced with my phone and app! I have had to forget and re-add it to my phone countless times. Right now I have not received notifications on my watch for at least a month. When I go to sync with the app to check on the stats for the day, it won't sync. I am able to check the stats on my wrist of course, but I personally would rather use the app. Basically it's a smart watch that is currently only being used as a regular watch to tell time. A pro of the watch is that the screen is very durable. I'll attach a photo of it currently. There are some scratches but it has never shattered over the nearly two years of use.",1
1,Does more than I expected. The sleep monitoring has improved since my last fit bit. The health metrics are great. My mom has a versa 2 also and I can check her stats and see how she's sleeping and breathing. I love it. She has a habit of not hearing her phone and the notifications on her watch really help that. I am upset about fitbit pay because it doesn't accept any of my banks. That's my only complaint.Update : the step counter is very inaccurate. It said I walked 1000 steps while I was sitting folding laundry. Every movement of my arm seems to be a step. My last fitbit was way more accurate.Update again : I have had this watch for two months now. The steps are wildly inaccurate. I rack up steps doing laundry but not walking around the grocery store. My guess is because I'm pushing a cart. It also has me walking up way more flights of stairs than I am. I am disappointed because these are main reasons I bought another fitbit. I'm starting to wonder how accurate the health metrics are.,3
0,"I traded in my Charge2 for the Versa 2 and have regretted it from day one. I've had it about a month.... Have factory reset multiple times, Spotify doesn't work right, Alexa doesn't work right, and the sleep tracking, which was the part I am most interested in, will say I went to bed 2-3 hours before I even laid down to sleep. I've auto corrected the time, adjusted how I wear it, switched watch faces...it truly is ridiculous. It shouldn't be this hard people, not for this price. Regarding exercise, I'll be reading a book for two hours straight and somehow magically hit my 10000 steps. Fitbit needs to recall these and figure it out. I'm returning and going back to the Charge 2. I am NOT an apple fan and don't feel like I'm quite at a point where I need a smart watch so the Charge works for me, but if you really need a smart watch, this is not the way to go. Save your money.",1
0,"I really like it when it works, but unfortunately it seems to hardly work.It's constantly disconnecting and not syncing properly, and I have it set to all day sync. Spotify doesn't work, keeps telling me to connect my phone to Bluetooth, which is already is, and then tells me no internet connection. It's always popping off and on the Bluetooth connection according to my phone, but I get maybe half the notifications I need.I like the watch, and I hate to return it, but I cannot justify spending almost 200 bucks on something I had to immediately research how to fix, and never getting a permanent fix. I'm tech savvy, but this is just annoying.",2

 Update: Got in touch with Fitbit support team and they were quick to resolve this and send a replacement, no sending the damage pebble back so that was helpful since Im not in the US. They didn't hesitate and we very helpfulThis was delivered on JAN 16th. I've had it for 6+ MONTHs and it's no longer working, I'm getting a white screen and it won't go past the white screen. For context, I've been in lock down since March, the watch has had NO Damage, not even scratched to indicate that I haven't taken care of it and yet even caring for it's not working, this obviolsy looks like a factory defect. I'm now trying to comunicate with FITBIT to maybe get a replacement or some kink of help to or help I just flushed the money down the toilet. This never happend with my Garmin so just spend a little extra and go for garmin.Set up takes around 1-1.5 hours. NOT IDEALI'm super data-driven and Calories and Heart Rate Zones when working out are completely inaccurate. You could be well up in Peak Zone and know and the watch will say you are in a different zone. Sometimes Calories during the working up won't change after 1-2 minutes which is frustrating is this a metric you want to track.",1
1,There are so many things to love about Fitbit. I love everything about and especially the Fitbit community- BUT- it breaks within a year- every year. So I have paid on average $100 a year for years. I would return the one I have now but it is already a replacement for the one I bought in 2020. So I don’t think they replace replacements. Everyone I know that has an apple 🍎 apple watch ⌚️ loves it. I never wanted to pay the extra money for it- but after- 5 years or so of this- I’m done. It is a headache and hassle everyone it breaks. Today my heart started beating fast and I have no way to check the heart rate since it broke again.Dear Fitbit- if you send me a free one I will take this post down- but I don’t think you will. Seriously- is there some 12 month self destruct chip in these things? I’m so frustrated. Now I have to go spend my time which is worth good money to figure out which one is the best Apple Watch to buy. Blessing to all!,5
0,"I bought my FitBit Versa 2 in Sept 2019. It is now Jan 2020. The Versa 2 is advertised as having the ability to track workout activity, which currently is not working properly. When using the manual tracking capability, after the watch started to track an activity, it stopped without notice or provocation, rendering the tracking capability useless, i.e. the stats related to the full workout were not recorded. This has happened quite often, so I sent in a written concern/complaint about this and FitBit's response was basically to say (I'm paraphrasing): This is a known issue that we hope to fix one day but we are not guaranteeing a fix, nor will we indicate how long a potential fix might take to implement. We're sorry you're not happy.Their exact words (taken from multiple emails):""Thanks for letting us know about this issue. We’re aware of it and are working to identify a resolution as quickly as possible. Our team is currently working to resolve this issue and hope to have a fix soon. We understand where you're coming from and we'll make sure to take note of your feedback so we can determine how we can further improve our products and services. Be sure to keep your Fitbit device and app up-to-date to ensure you receive the quickest resolution.""and also""...our team is currently working to resolve this issue and hope to have a fix soon. We don't have a specific time and date yet. Be sure to keep your Fitbit device and app up-to-date to ensure you receive the quickest resolution""and also ""To address your concern, we'd like to let you know that as this is a known issue, having a replacement is not an assurance to resolve the issue since we've received similar reports.""They will not send me a new device, despite the fact that the problem was not caused by me, and they won't guarantee this will be fixed. Basically, I just have to wait and hope that they might one day fix it. In the meantime, I've wasted $200 (I bought this when it was brand new).To FitBit (who I doubt is reading this or even cares): If you advertise a feature, that feature should work, especially if the feature is fundamental to the product!",1
0,"Bought this on 01/02/2020 as a gift for my better half and it died today and the warranty is only 1 year. Be careful when purchasing and definitely buy the extended warranty if you live in the US. (not quite sure why it would be 1 year in US and 2 years in Europe but hey! free market and such)I upgraded from the original Versa after it died right at the two year mark and now this one will not charge up and gets SUPER hot when trying. I would have expected it to last at least two years, but I guess there is a reason the warranty is only 1 year. Just do a quick internet search and you will see this is a normal problem with these watches and not just the Versa models. Very disappointing and would not recommend.",1
0,"I bought my original Versa 2 on July 4, 2021. Two months later the face just fell off due to the rubber ribbon seal giving way. So, I ordered a replacement Versa 2 on September 9. The new one arrived about a week later, and I began wearing it. Last week, November 15, the face dropped out of the new one while I was asleep. Exact same problem. Mind you, I was not rough on these watches. I wore them all the time, but they never were submerged in water or got wet. This is apparently a common issue that has not been fixed. Although it did nice things when it worked, the fact that two of them broke within 4 months has made me decide not to get another replacement.",1
1,"I like the watch. It's nice and light and not too big and bulky like some models. I would say that the build quality is very good, and quite pleasant to the eye. Syncs well with the Fitbit app, but with one exception . . . sleep tracking.One the first night of use, it didn't track at all. I had the watch set up properly, but it failed to track. I set the watch back to factory specs, and tried again. The next night it did track and record my sleep pattern, but not as well as my older Ionic. Early evening, last night, I started to watch a dumb chick flick movie that my wife wanted to watch. I fell asleep after the first 15 minutes of the movie. Boring, would be a kind way of evaluating the flick. Much to my dismay, after a long, forced nap, the watch did not record sleep. My older Ionic was perfect recording any nap times. I will be calling Fitbit to find out why this function is not working as it should.Another issue I have with this watch, which also applies to the Ionic, is the small screen size in relationship to the entire surface of the watch. Way too large a bezel/frame around the screen. If you compare it to the Apple Watch, it is much worse. The active screen on the Apple watch is much closer to the outer edge than the versa 2. I hope that Fitbit addresses this in their next line-up of models.At this point, I would prefer not to recommend the Versa 2 until I find out more about the sleep tracking issue.Edit: Well, I replaced the watch and the new one works just fine. Only problem that I have noticed is that I have developed a nasty rash from the rubber band. I'm tired of having to return items, so I will reach out to Fitbit. After all, they are the ones who should shoulder the responsibility. This has been a tiresome journey trying to find a workable smartwatch/fitness tracker. I went through three attempts with Huawei. The watches were great, but they had issues syncing with their apps on both Android and iOS phones. My replaced Versa 2 works great in that category, but now I have to deal with a rash issue.Further Edit Sept 18, 2020: I'm finding out that these watches are so very inaccurate/problematic. It was working fine up until a few days ago. I'm now getting sleep recording when I'm awake and out and about. Yesterday morning, for example, it recorded an hour session of sleep with 20 minutes of actual sleep. What a joke. I was working at the time of recording. I called Fitbit and they had no answer for me. It's going back, and I'm done with the Versa 2. Please, don't waste your money.",3
1,"This is my first Fitbit and I'm a fan. I didn't get it for exercise reasons, but wanted something that would help monitor certain aspects of my health. The ability to use additional apps such as Alexa is a plus, and actually handier than I thought it would be.I haven't had any of the software issues that other people have mentioned. For what it's worth, I'm using a Google Pixel 2 alongside my Fitbit. Setting the watch and software up was relatively quick and painless. I did have a minor syncing issue once on the very first day, but all I had to do was restart my phone and everything was fine.It looks great. I'm small-framed with very small wrists and nothing about the watch feels or looks bulky or out of sorts. It feels comfortable during the day and while I'm sleeping.Overall, I'm very pleased, and am considering purchasing an additional watch for my boyfriend.",5
0,"I have been a Fitbit user for the past 6 years. Each fitbit eventually stops working and Fitbit tells you its outside of warranty so they won't fix it. I received all of mine as gifts. Got the Versa 2 last Christmas and last week , inexplicably the face fell out of its casing.When I looked it up its a known issue per Fitbit. I reached out and after a week of trying to get help via social media (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram) and email I was finally told that because I'm THREE WEEKS outside of warranty my only option is to buy a new one. Again this is a KNOWN issue with the product and the company refuses to fix it. Horrible company.Their products are inferior. They WILL break at no fault to the issue. FITBIT WILL NOT HELP YOU",1
0,"This was the third Fitbit product I've owned, and I'm done! The two previous watches I had to have replaced within the first year. This one never worked well from the beginning. I often had trouble syncing the watch to my phone app. Often, I couldn't get anything but the watch and steps to work properly. I was never able to get Alexa or the alarms to work. I've not been able to sync since July of last year. It will still charge quickly but the time is always wrong since it will never sync.I was traveling, moving, and dealing with family health issues and never got around to trying to get a replacement from Fitbit.The only good things I can say about this watch is that it charges quickly and is waterproof.",1
0,"I really liked this product from the get-go. However, about a week in it started disconnecting from my Bluetooth and would no longer sync to my app. I really wanted this to be a good tool for my weight loss journey and for a while it was after I spoke to a tech at Fitbit and he walked me through resetting it. I had to do this about once a week and then it just got to be annoying. When it syncs it works great, most of the time, but having to continue to reset it is cumbersome and it really shouldn't be that way! I got off the exercise wagon for awhile during a bad time in my life and after about 6 weeks (still wearing the watch the whole time because I was used to having the clock right on my arm, etc.) I noticed the time was off from my phone by about 3 min. I looked it up online and read that you have to sync it often to keep it up to date/time. So I did that and it worked well for about a week. Now, it won't even connect to Bluetooth! I've tried doing the reset process more than a dozen times and my phone won't even recognize it anymore! I don't have an old iPhone (11 Pro Max) but I turned my phone off and back on again to ensure it wasn't my phone and still nothing. Now I have to contact Fitbit again which is HIGHLY annoying and again, I really shouldn't have to do that! It's not even a year old for heaven's sake! I would recommend spending more on a better quality Fitbit because they do work very well and have a lot of great features when they work. I would prefer an Apple watch to round out my Apple products, but I can't bring myself to spend $500+ on something like this...",2
0,"If it worked as intended it would be great. But I had to have a new one sent when the motion tracker on my original Versa 2 stopped working at 6 months and wouldn't wake when I raised my wrist. The new one solved that issue but the heat rate monitor has never worked properly. I can do an intense workout and it says my rate never went above 100. I've done everything they suggest and nothing gets it to work consistently. I like it a lot when it works, but unless they improve the reliability substantially, I would not buy another Fitbit.Update: At only 16 months old the replacement watch has started outright malfunctioning, restarting itself multiple times a day. I've done all the steps FitBit support advised to no avail. The worst part is I really would like the watch if it actually worked.",2
1,"So far, I really like this fitbit. It's comfortable to wear, and I've even worn it in the shower. It has so many different components that I've not yet used. As for the sleep tracking, which is the main reason I got it, I think I'll have to log more time.It's really good at reminders to get up and do more steps, and is a very nice personal cheerleader when you've reached a goal.It shows incoming email with surprising detail on something so small. It also has a weather feature for two cities that's pretty nice also.Need to calm down, there's a breathing app for that. If you're a powerhouse exerciser, this will keep track of zones, stairs, strides, even yoga...which I haven't had a chance to try out yet.There are alarms, music downloads-but you need ear buds to hear. And your calendar is also something you can sync.I had a fitbit Alta, and this has way more options for me to learn.As I do, I'll update the stars. They're at 3 only because it's new, and I'm gathering information. I really like it so far. I also swapped out the band with a magnetic metal one that breathes and is totally adjustable.When you remove the watch for charging, or just because, there is a privacy feature you can set that locks the screen and data. Only you know the code!I got this on sale during Amazon Prime days and thought that was a nice deal also. It pairs well with my Android phone.Get it and stay healthy!",5
1,"I was super excited to get this fitness watch and wanted to love it. Overall it is a nice watch. I love that there are so many accessories for the fitbits and the app seems good as far as what data it collects and the ease of navigating it. My main issues and it was a deal breaker for me was that it was inaccurate in reading my steps and calories burned. I would get over 2000 ghost steps every day in comparison to galaxy fit2 and garmin vivoactive 3. This inaccuracy also lead to inaccurate calories burned readings. The other thing that was super inaccurate was its gps reading. It wasn't even close to the path that I walked which is really weird considering its gps is tethered to my phone. I've never had an issue with different tracking apps, the whoop and galaxy fit 2 mapping out my walks so I'm sure its an issue on fitbit's end. The first night it did not detect my sleep but I had no issues with that after the first night. The HR monitoring though seems to be pretty accurate at least. It's a pretty watch and easy to navigate and use. The screen quality is nice. The battery life seemed pretty good and about 5 days before you need to charge it, I assume because I never really let it go below 50% before I charged it again. Like I said, I really wanted to love this watch since I heard such great things about the fitbits and several of my friends use them so it would have been fun. The inaccurate readings plus to get the more detailed sleep analysis you need the premium membership, which I really didn't want to pay for (which is the reason I stopped using my whoop), are the main reasons to why I ended up returning it. I signed up for the 90 day free trial premium membership and just fyi, there is no easy way to cancel it. You can't access it in your settings. I couldn't get the chat to work and not sure if its a trigger when you use the word ""cancel"" because the chat app said sorry no agents available and call in when I tried the chat app during their normal hours. I had to call in to cancel but overall I didn't have to wait too long and it was pretty easy to do. I just hate having to go to that step, they should just let you handle all of that in your settings.",3
0,"My product lasted me just over a year. I tried to contact fitbit support after a system update was pushed through and the device stopped tracking my heart rate. The sensor completely failed. Fitbit support was rude and offered me a discount to buy another device to be deemed defective directly after a software update. In fitbit community forums there are dozens of people going through the same problem, yet they seem to be ignoring the fact that it always happens after an update. Then after just asking why the update would cause issues, the customer service person had the gall to tell me that my device is defective and I should just take it to a recycling place for proper disposal. They will NOT acknowledge the real issue. I was not asking for a free replacement. Just answers they refuse to give.",1
0,"I’ve had this thing over a year. It’s my second FitBit and replaced an a iconic, which I also gave 1 star. I won’t repeat the digs on its smart watch features. It’s not a smart watch, so what do you expect? It is a fitness tracker.But there is a difference between great fitness tracking “features” and the “quality” of those features. I have high end secondary ways to measure things like heart rate. The FitBit is almost always 10bpm, too high. That means the HR feature is worthless. That one is obvious, but it makes you wonder whether other features like sleep measures in deep sleep are similarly totally wrong. In other words, it make you question the validity of any info it gives you. Garbage in, garbage out. Data collection is everything. This thing seems to make things up as it goes along. Great that it can measure deep sleep, horrible if it just makes up a number by implication cuz the data collection method is horrible. It often thinks I’m a sleeping while driving. Hmm?But the worse thing is dependability. Like the Iconic, after a year, it just plain stopped working. Just like that. Rather suspicious. Great battery life is useless if the thing won’t work. And it only synked on Tuesdays with a full moon.Save your money. I’m replacing it with an Apple watch.",1
1,"Bad Buy, Good Warranty Replacement. Here's how it went..Versa 2 Worked awful out of the box. Fitbit replaced after much hassle. BWare when they replace you. You have to confirm thru an email that they don't send. Without confirmation they void your warranty replacement. Had to fight that battle all over again and demand the verification email that they don't tell you about and don't send without you hollering about it.When the hollering was over (many days of calls and continued problems) I had a new Versa 2 that now works quite well. Why all the hassle, I don't know. You'll have to ask them.Everything worked out well now but the hassle, WoW, Why???",3
1,"This is the third Fit Bit I have bought for my mother. At 77 now she loves being able to see what’s going on internally compared to what her Doctors tell her should be going on. I also find it to be a fantastic product. The only issue I have is setting one up. I’ve done it three times now. It seems with the technology at play it would be a much simpler plug and play process. It always starts out with not being able to locate the device while it is connected to the laptop with the app installed on it. If my mother had to do the setup she would never make it through. There has to be something to make it a more user friendly, plug and play process. That being said, it is a product that ultimately is worth a little frustration to have doing what it does.",4
1,"Gonna start this off by saying, I've only had this one day, so I'm probably going to come back at the three and six month marks to update.That said, I love this watch!! I went ahead and signed up for the premium features (I like the programs they have and the extra features but they aren't essential) even though I wouldn't say its *needed*. The set up was incredibly intuitive straight out the gate. You *can* integrate it to Alexa very easily, but its not required. I will say, if you've set up an echo, you can do this no problem.So far, its reminded me to walk more, helped me track my heart rate and breathing rates (for anxiety spikes), and reminded me to hydrate. The included guided meditations and focuses are very well done and they lowed my heart rate by 10 bpm, so that was pretty incredible.One caveat, which is true about a lot of step trackers, its not... exactly accurate. If you gesture with your hands a lot (I don't know if I could physically speak with out using my hands, its a curse) you're going to need to adjust your steps per day down a bit. A swinging motion with the hand that has the watch on it will count as a step.",5
1,"Owned this smart watch for almost a year now. Once every 10 days or so it restarts overnight or it does something that stops measuring the sleep cycle which is quite annoying since that’s the main reason I got it.I must say I have considered switching to an Apple Watch for a while now but you get the exact same thing (fitness tracker, WhatsApp and other app notifications, sleep tracker), it updates every once in a while (over the last year I’ve seen the mindfulness and stress tracking added to the list). Used it both with a Samsung S10+ and now iPhone 11 and it works just great with both.Battery life is wonderful (around five days, counting around two or three workouts) which is what has kept me off switching to Apple Watch.Got my second complimentary Fitbit premium membership (another 3 months) which is absolutely not necessary to get a good use out of the watch but it’s a nice upgrade.Step count is a little too sensitive for my liking, but works pretty well too.Overall, a couple of minor glitches but so happy with it. Band is starting to wear off now, though.",5
0,"This product has many flaws in it.1. It counts steps even if you don’t walk or just move your arm.2. The heart rate tracker isn’t the best compared to other products.3. Connecting with the app is a pain.Overall, not a great product. You can look at Fossil, Garmin, and other products.",1
0,"I bought the Versa 2 to replace my Pebble (battery takes longer and longer to charge). I was also interested in heart rate and SpO2 tracking. The heart rate tracking worked splendidly; I could now use it to determine when I cooled down enough after training instead of taking manual pulse readings. Three days of bliss. Then there was a watch firmware update that purportedly enabled the SpO2 tracking. Unfortunately, what it did was make the heart rate measurements erratic (spontaneously read more than double the rate) that I verified was spurious by manual pulse count.I contacted Fitbit support via chat. I noted that heart rate measurement was spot on before the firmware update and then immediately started providing erratic readings after the firmware update. I was given the usual brain-dead advice of doing al the usual restarts, etc. which I had already done (I had even reset to factory defaults and completely started from scratch). It seems rather obvious that it was the firmware update. What I wanted and what I hoped the factory reset would do is back out the firmware change. If correct heart rate measurement resumed, then we'd have clear identification of the problem. But that is beyond what the usual support chats can do.What is maddening is that this problem can be incredibly easy to resolve by reverting to the previous firmware (what harm could it inflict? it was working just fine with the previous firmware) and determining whether proper heart rate tracking resumed.Of course, SpO2 monitoring didn't work, either, but then it wasn't working before so no loss there. But if I'm not getting dependable heart rate measurements, I can get the other features with a cheaper watch. And I will.Update: today, the Versa 2 hasn't been able to sync with my phone for 11 hours. Restarting the phone and the watch did not help. Perhaps Fitbit should have better used the assets they gained from Pebble; during the years I had my Pebble, sync was never a problem. Most of my maintenance of the Pebble was reigning in notifications on the watch; I suppose Fitbit's solution is to have no notifications at all by having it fail to sync.",1
0,"The first watch I received would not connect with the app despite showing up on the iphone. After calling customer support and going in circles for 2 days with multiple factory resets, I sent it back to Amazon. The replacement went well for a few months, but now alarms at midnight randomly about every two weeks. I was told to do a factory reset, which I did. The problem is back now and the response is to send a picture of it for documentation. I do not take my phone to bed with me and I would have a few seconds to wake up, grab the phone and try to snap the screen. Every two or three days , I have to delete the device and link it again by Bluetooth. The annoying movement notification also has started popping up in the middle of the night. The watch does keep time, but will keep you up all night. Stick with an apple watch. This one has terrible quality control and worse customer service.",1
0,"The Versa 2 is my 5th Fitbit device.I bought the Ionic as an upgrade from my Charge 2. I do CrossFit, HITT and run the occasional 5K so I like the built-in GPS.However, the Ionic is big and heavy for my tiny wrists. I ""upgraded"" to the Versa because it was smaller and newer.I like the watch but you cannot rely on the heart tracker. During a HITT class, my heart rate was in the ""below"" zone and I was doing burpees! I know I was working hard and the Versa 2 still registered 60% of my workout in the below zone. During one class, my heart rate dropped to 59 bpm. Again, this is during a CrossFit class. My heart rate doesn't go that low when I'm sleeping. According to FitBit, the tracker must be tight and above your wrist bone by two fingers. I wear the small band and had it on notch 2. I kept pushing it up on my arm and it still wasn't registering even in the cardio zone. I switched back to my Ionic today and it registered a more expected heart rate. Maybe if you have larger wrists, the Versa 2 would work. I work out hard and I want my Fitbit to reflect - accurately - how hard I'm working. I'm very disappointed and I'm stuck with a tracker that doesn't track.",2
0,"The touch screen on my Fitbit Versa 2 stopped working a few months after the 1-year warranty on the watch expired, making the watch entirely useless. I called Fitbit customer service, and they said the best they could do for me was a small percent discount on buying a new watch. In case you're wondering, I treated the watch well and never damaged it -- only used it to track my runs. Do not buy this watch unless you want to get ripped off!You will find similar complaints to mine if you search Google. I, for one, will not buy another Fitbit product again and I hope this review saves you the trouble and wasted money. This is built-in obsolescence at its prime! Do not support such awful, wasteful brands!A few other complaints:* The phone app is extremely buggy. Several updates have made the app and watch stop working entirely. Check the Google Play App Store reviews as this is a common problem!* The watch face store is extremely clunky. There's no way to filter out watch faces by average reviews and it's extremely time-consuming to sift through hundreds of (crappy) watch faces to find one mediocre one. Horrible user experience.* Most of the watch apps I tried did not work properly. Want to control your Spotify playback via the watch? Sure, there's an app for it, but it does not work the grand majority of the time. Apps are truly a badly executed afterthought for this watch and any Fitbit watch.",1
0,They need to hire someone that can make a UI that is more intuitive. When they bought Pebble they should have just updated the Pebble app and store. This app is confusing and forces users to dig around way too much. I also get steps all the time when sitting at my desk.** 6 month update **This is a pile of junk. I will be buying something not made by fitbit. My battery is constantly low already. The Bluetooth is flaky and the screen is scratched. A $200 watch can't make it 6 months? I had my pebble since the kickstarter. I won't buy another fitbit product again.,1
1,"Well, first it measures your heart rate pretty well and I liked it a lot for a long time and kept me in check when I work out. Has alot of options to keep things on track such as water intake and menstrual cycle.However, I noticed a couple of things that I dislike and decided to give it away to my mom. when it counts the steps it doesn't really counts it accurately. It was buzzing that I reached 10,000 steps while I was sitting down with my boyfriend.And it won't measure my heart rate sometimes while I work out and I have a small wrist so the fitbit part is too much sometimes during workout sessions.Changing fitbit face was a joke. Too many ads and not enough free options. When I try to use the payment option it tried to make me download another app and Starbucks card options was annoying to set it up.Weather app was working alright but it is weather app🤷‍♀️.So I got samsung fit2 and gave this one to my mom. I think it wasn't for me.",3
0,"UPDATE: After it's almost 2 year anniversary. The device has died after downloading done Sudoku Kitty Watch Face and wouldn't turn back on. But since it's no longer in warranty. They won't replace it. Figured as much but how stupid is it this device died from downloading a watch face off the Fitbit app...OLDER: After having this watch for 4 months, I actually regret my purchase of this expensive, flawed device.The Alexa support is not 100%, actually you're quite limited in what to tell Alexa to do. It's more better if you like making mental notes more than anything. But don't forget to have your Alexa app open on your phone or else the function on the watch wont work... Like I said, has its flaws.Another flaw is to use certain functions like certain backgrounds and better customization for your watch, like everything else Amazon, need to get that Premium.. I think I get added more by hack bots on their fitbit app than I do on Facebook. The notifications of people to add you who don't even have a fitbit is ridiculous... and I suggest not adding them.The only good thing I find about this fitbit is that I can show my Doctor just how active and how much I sleep. The sleep part only goes into depth if you have that sub of course. It definitely is waterproof, shower wise. I haven't gone sleeping but I have taken long showers with it on and washed my hair with no problems of any functions on the watch itself.Oh my goodness, I almost forgot to mention how the syncing is for this and the app. Terrible. I have never had to close and open, refresh bluetooth for a device so much right out of the box it was stupid.. I was extremely close to returning it then. But if I didn't need to help track my fitness and getting this on a little sale... I would have. This app needs so much work as well as the watches software itself, it's quite annoying.To be honest, I feel like I only bought a overly fancy watch that can't do much besides track my fitness and sleep if I pay for a sub on it. I wasn't expecting this watch to have to rely on my phone so much though, biggest downfall I found. If I wanted a watch to be this dependent on a phone app, would of been better to get a watch with GPS in it at least.",1
1,"Previously had a Fitbit Inspire but wanted to upgrade to Versa 2 for the following reasons:View in direct sunlight.Elevation tracking.GPS tracing of hikes.It has provided this and more!I love the sleep tracking and it's helped me make adjustments so I can get consistently more sleep.Didn't think I'd use the heart rate tracking, but it's been extremely helpful in identifying sources of stress and sources of peace and whether I'm more at peace or more under stress at any point in time.It also shows which exercises keep me in a fat burning zone well after they're completed.I use the motion based setting for waking the display up as opposed to always on and I get 5 days of battery life.It charges very rapidly, 5 - 10 minutes usually.The only other feature is use is a customer face that shows current weather.",5
1,"Main issue I have found - in the pictures you can see that the manufactured band that comes with the watch is put together backwards. If you try to reverse it the pins won't match up and the closer is upside down. I don't know if it was simply a 1 off and I got it or this is actually how they are all made. It makes wearing it uncomfortable really bad.I love the watch in itself, I chose this particular smart watch because of it tracking swim laps as it's my main workout system. The trackers (heart, Step, etc.) seam to be accurate. I haven't gone swimming yet in it so can't say on that part or if it will hold up underwater (will update once I have).Now for the features -Text / Call alerts - No issues setting up the notifications they come through with no issues. My biggest issue is that text messages pop up and disappear really fast on the watch and you can't go back and retrieve them.Fitbit Pay - can't use as there are not many banks on their list (neither of my banks was available) can't add Google pay to the watch either so that feature is useless for me now.Music - You can use Spotify and Pandora can't use Ymusic or YouTube music (same thing) I've switched to Spotify from YouTube music and works great. I can skip tracks no problem at all stop / play music as well.Weather - Is accurateYou can use alot of other apps for notifications and quick replies such as - Facebook - Facebook Messenger - Seesaw - Gmail - any alot more.Add Google pay and fix the band that comes with it and this would have 5 stars 🌟",3
0,"The mobile app can be a bit confusing as where to find and do things. The learning curve was sort of large taking time to figure it all out. As a fitness and sleep tracker the watch did a good job. As a smart watch, for me it didn't fit the bill. I was never able to consistently receive notifications from my phone. I spent a good amount amount of time troubleshooting with tech support and was then told it was a known problem and they are ""working on it"". You can approve or ignore a phone call but you can't ""take"" a call because there is no speaker. The apps that are available are fairly limited. There are a fair number of faces available but most are pretty basic. Many faces and apps have to be paid for. I am a former Pebble watch user that was left out in the cold when FitBit bought Pebble (which was a great watch). I was very hopeful that the Versa 2 was an advanced version of my Pebble Round. Instead, it misses the mark. The one thing I must say is that the battery life was very good. It was the one thing that almost made me hang onto it and wait for better. The ledge wasn't wide enough, I jumped off and returned it.",2
1,"I love the Fitbit. Even though I have the versa now, I started out with the Fitbit charge 2, then moved onto the iconic. I have list 20 lbs by tracking and increasing my goal over the 1st 18 months. The weight loss was natural and slow. I wasn’t dieting, but increased my activity and steady goes it.The only thing I have a problem with is it seems the lifespan of each one was about 12-18 months. I’m so hooked that I always buy another. They’ve just stopped working. I have had them replaced by Fitbit, so for that I’m grateful. They’ve replaced the watch, the band and even the charger at different times. So be prepared to have some issues. It’s electronic, with a one year warranty. That’s about the lifespan, in my experience.",4
0,"I loved this watch. But when I went to do an update on software everything whacked out. The screen would go black. Then it would just randomly switch from sleeping to heart rate to steps when ever it wanted. Then the screen went green for 4 days I couldn't even get into the watch. Although it did track through my phone I bought it to track on the watch! Can't get any help due to the world being on shut down, which is understandable but I could have got my complaint in sooner. Tried message boards ev1 with the same issue so what do we do? Now it just doesn't work at all. Just a black screen and yes it's charged. Of course my return date was Jan 31st. I only bought it on December 25th. Seems like for $150 dollars I should get more than 3 months out of it. I'm quite upset about it and def not happy. I feel like I just threw $150 away and this is the first watch I've purchased in about 30 years and I loved it. I see a lot of unhappy reviews out there with the same issue.",2
0,"I was upgrading my previous fitbit with this Versa 2 and it died after 5 weeks of having it. It no longer held a charge and the color on the screen was all corrupted as well. I've always been a big fan of fitbit but this purchase made me no longer want to be a fitbit customer. I was 3 days out of being able to return this to Amazon. So had to go through fitbit and I still dont have my replacement nor can they replace the one i bought. They said i had ot return all pieces and then when the order email came they were only sending me the face> I sent them everything the original box. When i called them about it they said well we cant do that so now i am getting all the pieces and have to assemble it not to mention its not the bordeaux I ordered which apparently I can still get from amazon, but not from fitbit. Do yourself a favor and get a garmin or apple watch. Fitbit has lost its way, as it used to be a great company with great products and customer service. IT has fallen apart, i have now spent as much time waiting for my replacement, which I still dont have, as the amount of time i actually had my purchase before it broke. I hate that i couldnt go through amazon to resolve it and now am ending up with something i didnt want. Amazon has the better customer service so once you are out of that options you have to deal with FitBit and thats just a mess.",2
0,"The Fitbit tracks my ""steps"" when I move my arm, even when I am sitting still. My step count is therefore completely inaccurate. I like the look of the watch and the face is easy to read. Aside from that this is a waste of money.I bought this to track my steps and also to be able to see my text messages while away from my phone. As mentioned above the step counter is way off and I have had an impossible time keeping this watch connected to my phone so I'm not able to receive my text messages on the watch. I do occasionally receive notifications when I have a phone call but other than the first couple of days of having the watch, I've never been able to receive notification of a text message.I had a Garmin tracker prior to this. I never had any issues with it. I only replaced it because it was not as aesthetically pleasing as the Fitbit.Overall I find this watch to be a waste of my hard earned money.",2
1,"Great tracker but the heart rate is marginal for sure.Reason: bpm during exercise is roughly 30+ bpm above the actual.I have recently had heart surgery and currently in cardiac rehab connected to heart to monitors that show actual bpm during exercise. The versa2 starts off correctly and then as time continues the bpm increases way to high compared to actuals.Return first Versa due to this bpm issue. The second replaced Versa did the increase once. I turned of heart rate, reset the versa2, and turned on the heart rate. Working ok for now but will monitor and update the review later.Heart rate is the heart of the versa2 and should not be marginal when your life depends on it.Fitbit please address the issue.",3
0,"Don't buy this if you have a Google Pixel phone. Text notifications (which was one of the main reasons I bought this) does not sync with my phone, rendering the Versa 2 basically useless for me. Texts would come through for about a month, but now they no longer do. I don't know what Fitbit did to break this, but they don't seem to be in any rush to fix it. I loved my Fitbit Blaze and decided to upgrade thinking everything would be fine if not better....big mistake and a HUGE waste of money!",1
0,"Great battery life, good step tracker, horrible for tracking sleep. Last night's report says I slept from 10:53 p.m. till 12:24 a.m. then from 1:25 a.m. till 7:41 a.m., then from 9:59 p.m. till 11:11 p.m., then from 1:38 a.m. till 8:31 a.m. Obviously totally out of whack, and it happens all the time! I usually go to bed around 10:30 and go right to sleep. Many nights my FitBit says I didn't fall asleep until 1:00 or 2:00 in the morning. My FitBit Versa 1 had the same problem. When the battery died and FitBit gave me an accommodation price on the Versa 2, I hoped it would work better. It doesn't. Oh, and in addition to my original FitBit Versa 1, I've had to replace two FitBit 2s because of dead batteries. Next time this one dies, it will be out of warranty. I don't think I'll go for the accommodation price for the next generation. :-(",2

This Fitbit had never been dropped, soaked with water or any type of damage. It just went black one day and never came back.

So disappointed because I had heard such great things.",1
1,"Some of the major selling points, Alexa and Spotify, are terribly implemented, and Spotify especially is nearly unusable because it continuously logs you out, not just on the this Fitbit Versa 2 and the accompanying Fitbit app, but on ALL of our devices. The icing on the cake is that when attempting to sign back in on our android Spotify apps, the user email and password do not work, and the email reset link times out immediately too.The only way I've found to sign back in to Spotify is to either delete all app data, or uninstall and reinstall the app, both of which remove all your downloads and settings, every...single...time.There are forums from 2015 to now where hundreds of people are complaining about exactly the same problem with their Fitbit and Spotify, which still hasn't been resolved in 2020.So much for downloading playlists and swimming laps at the gym with waterproof wireless earbuds while the phone is safe and dry in the locker, half of the reason my wife wanted one of these.This really needs to be dealt with, by both Fitbit and Spotify.",3
1,"I did love this watch for the just over a year I'd had it. I bought it mostly for the heart rate monitor because my heart rate gets extremely high when I work out and leads to migraines. It worked perfectly until (conveniently) just after my year warranty was up.A year and just over a month after I bought it fitbit required a software update on my versa 2. After the update, though, my heart rate monitor stopped working correctly. It would say my heart rate during my cool down was higher than the hour long cardio workout I'd just finished. I contacted fitbit twice. The first time they had me turn the hr monitor off and back on. A few days later when I contacted them again, they told me I was passed my warranty coverage, but I could get 30% off another fitbit watch. So after spending $150 on a watch that only lasted one year, they expect me to spend another $150-250 on another that will probably last just over one year- again.Very disappointed in fitbit and their products. Don't recommend to anyone that wants their watch to last a bit longer than a year.",5
1,"The media could not be loaded.
 Not sure who's to blame, my smartphone (Oneplus 6T) or the watch, but I couldn't even get it set up. Whenever I tried, a ""popup"" just kept appearing and didn't allow me to do anything. Sure I could probably troubleshoot, but its not a great start so its easier just to return it. Docking 2 stars for that.The other star is because it didn't feel too comfortable. The back part, where it rests on your wrist, is way too convex, which is odd, I feel it should be concave so it forms to the natural curvature of the wrist.UPDATE: Got it to work! First make sure the watch is off, then install and go into the app, follow the steps until it asks to connect to the watch, then you can turn on the watch, it'll connect and work!So far, it's worked great. There's still some flaws, like the button being on the left side, never seen a watch with buttons on the left, I mean it could be great for right handers, but why not have an option to rotate the screen.Regardless, the main reason I switched to this was because my last watch's battery was so terrible, this one is pretty great so far. It has all the other functions I care about, monitoring heart rate, tracking fitness sessions, and changing the watch face.The fit is still odd, its not uncomfortable, but just the way it was designed (or perhaps the straps) has the watch usually sitting awkwardly high up on my wrist than it should be. I plan to get other straps, so hopefully that remedies that.Overall it's looking like a keeper. Still, minus 1 star for the terrible start, and another for the strange fit and inability to rotate the screen.",3
0,"I've had my Versa 2 about two months now. Shortly after I bought it, my watch recieved a new firmware and the Versa 3 was released. Ever since that time, my battery life, which had been doing a great 4 - 5 days depending on how active I was, is down to about 42 - 44 hours, max. Had a few days where it barely managed that. The screen has also started getting washed out has been acting weird.Checked with friends with the same watch, and least a couple are encountering similar problems, especially on the battery life side of things.Love the watch, but issues an iOS app store review weeks ago, zero response, so here's my review - great watch and good app - just don't update your firmware apparently if they're about to release a new product, because seems like a good way to ruin your watch.",1
0,"I’ve had this Fitbit for 16 months now and it is the most frustrating piece of technology I have ever owned. A lot of connectivity issues and you never know that it’s not syncing to your phone unless you’re looking at the watch and comparing the data to the app. I tried contacting Fitbit once and got a lecture about not disconnecting and reconnecting the watch to my account for trouble shooting- which was unhelpful and still didn’t solve my problem of connectivity issues. Of course the worst of the issues appeared 13 months after owning, when the warranty is expired. Now the watch randomly shuts off for no reason and has to be restarted in order to show even the time. Also randomly, the watch will use its entire battery in one day and then the next charge it will last for a week. Craziest thing and extremely inconsistent. It can be hours before I look at my watch to realize it’s been off the whole time not tracking anything. It’s never been wet- after reading reviews about it not working properly after getting wet contrary to its advertisement- I even take it off to wash the dishes. So no water damage and it still has lots of issues. Needless to say, save your money and get a different model or brand.Two stars because it seemed fairly accurate on the rare occasion it works properly.",2
0,"After about a month of use all I can really say about it is ""meh"".Cons - (if you workout a lot) I found wearing this for so many active hours a week caused sores on my wrist. The material of the strap will do a number on your skin. I rotate wrists, right now the sores on the left wrist are recovering while the strap destroys my right wrist. - Heart rate monitor isn't reliable. I've had it strapped really tightly to my wrist, yet if I'm getting very active the heartrate screen blinks out as if there is no contact with my wrist. I have a medical grade heart rate monitor, I compared it to that one in real time. The Fitbit is off, usually by 5-7~. - The shortcut key is very annoying. Frequently when doing sphinx pushups or just pushups in general the key is depressed by my wrist. Alexa or whatever else pops up. Might as well set the shortcut key to nothing. - I turned on the 'Lock device if it leaves your wrist"" security feature. Even though its strapped tightly, I have to enter the code about every other 10 minutes. - The workout menu is full of activities I do not give a single shit about. I cannot remove them or add activities I DO CARE about. - Spotify link to your phone is horrible, not sure why I'd ever want to use it. Half the time it says it cant find your phone, even though you repeatedly sync it. Spent more time trying to make it work than I actually functionally used it. - Quality of audio output to a speaker or blue tooth headphones is absolutely horrible. - The cardio fitness score makes zero sense. It started really high for me, then by the end of the month its telling me POOR to FAIR 31-35, ""Poor fitness for men your age"". I do at least 15 hours of cardio a week on a bad week, and a full lifting schedule. So I assume the rating is completely meaningless.Pros - Workout tracker is decent. Aside from the preset workout activities you cannot remove. - A selection of free clockfaces to find a display of information to your liking. Its not a very big selection though. - There is a method for adding and paying with credit cards using the device itself. I have not used this however, the security is dubious. - The phone app adds a lot. Its easier to track your calories and water on the phone, you can search from a lot of pre-made entries for common meals, organic breads, meats, etc. Pretty convenient for tracking your calories and water input. - There are a few handy apps you can get for free installed to the watch. Particularly handy is the 'Find your phone' app, for those of us who can't manage to leave it where we can find it.",2
1,"Battery life is abysmal. I get about 5 days out of it without having to recharge it. Wouldn't mind a bigger device if I only had to charge it once a month or so.I do like the steps tracking, and sleep tracking. Sometimes the device doesn't understand that I've twisted my wrist to check the time and I have to press the button. I have to do a hard ""snap"" of the wrist and that works, othertimes I just like to move my wrist gently. Unfortunately, always on is not acceptable because the bad battery life is even worse.Furthermore, you need FitBit's charger, so if you lose it, that's a specialty device you have to pay for.The fitbit android app is total garbage outside of the core functions. The syncing over wifi with my Pixel 4 XL never ever works, only bluetooth updating works, which means the core updates take forever. Fitbit Premium is not worth the price it's asking for.For $230 I expected way more, but I guess the tech just isn't quite there yet. Still, it's nice as a smartwatch with some pedometer functions, which is what I wanted. The software is just slow and clunky.",4
1,"If you're on the fence between this and an Apple watch, the Versa gets my vote. I bought an Apple watch (series 3 - the only one in the budget) in October after my old Fitbit died, and for four months my interest in it dwindled down to nothing. I found that the rings system was less motivating to me than pure numbers, that I really, really missed the sleep tracking feature that Fitbit offers, that the Apple battery life on the 3 was and that I kept forgetting to pick it up from the charger because I wasn't looking at it enough throughout the day to care. I finally decided to sell the Apple Watch on FB Marketplace and order this.I'm thrilled with that decision!! I've had the Versa for two days and already my steps are higher, my movement is more frequent, and I'm feeling more invested in the whole thing. I like the look just as much, I love the bigger screen, the strap feels more secure than the Apple watch's strap, and it still pushes my texts and notifications through. I rarely used the ""text back"" feature on the Apple so I don't miss it on the Fitbit. I've connected Spotify so I'm good there. I'm loving the comprehensive app (and I don't even have premium) which I found very unsatisfactory with Apple. Overall I'm obviously really glad I made the switch back to Fitbit, and I don't think I'll ever switch again.",5
1,"So here's where I'm at. I'm still new to Fitbit, 48 hrs exactly, and I have to say:1. For non tech savvy people it's not user friendly at all.2. It doesn't seem to be doing things, sleep hours, heart rate, that I did figure out how to set up (I think).3. There is absolutely no way that I have found to put music on here. Fitbit Versa 2. I've looked all over and no music shows up except for the music in the phone app and, of course, the watch but getting the computer app to show a music file isn't happening. What I've found is to use fitbitconnect but when I look for FBconnect all I get is the regular phone app, no connect.4. The directions I received with the watch were all foreign.5. And finally for what I paid for the watch I don't feel like I should have to buy more accessories just to be able to get music. Some info suggested the dongle, but none I've seen said it will work for V2.I don't have a wireless or Bluetooth computer so using those options won't work for me. I'm probably going to see if someone can help me figure it out and if not most likely I'll just return it and find something a little less complicated.For more tech savvy folks and people with wireless computers I don't think you would be disappointed.",3
0,"I had this watch all of 3 hours before deciding to return it!! Horrible accuracy on the step tracker which was to me one of the most important features. I can lay in bed and record all of my goal steps of 10,000 by shaking my arm!! I work in a very fast paced environment where my arms move very fast, I would record thousands of steps without moving my feet. Today I sat in a classroom and because of my arm movements I racked up nearly 3,000 steps!! It was also disappointing to learn Alexa doesn't talk to you, she will text you the answers, that is if she can get a signal. If not it says thinking thinking.....NOPE very poor quality for the money. If this was a $30 watch I could understand the incompetency but not for a $200 watch! I will stick to my Samsung heath app on my phone it does much better at recording my ACTUAL steps.",1
1,"This review has nothing to do with how the VERSA 2 actually works. I have a Charge 2 and I thought I'd enjoy the upgrade. I have several bands for my Charge 2 including stainless and leather. I wear it all the time and like to dress it up. It has a cool little clip that makes band changes a breeze - well designed. The VERSA 2 has no such clip. It has the tiny little spring pin like a regular watchband, with a little protrusion that's supposed to allow you to pull back the little pin without using jeweler's tools. NOT! The little protrusion is almost impossible to use. It took me 10 minutes of hard work to switch the rubber band's size. I couldn't imagine doing this before going out when wanting to upgrade to a leather band. It seems like some bean counter at FITBIT came up with a way to save a few nickels on this unit by designing this horrible band system. Big mistake!",3
1,"I'm so disappointed with FitBit in general. I've owned 4 versions of the Fitbit. I thought that by now, the kinks would have been worked out but they've all but been ignored.My steps are largely over estimated. As is my sleep. My period prediction will not show correct information even though I've supplied information to my very clockwork- like cycle. It's unchanging so it should be easy to track. I bought cases to cover the screen but they turned out to be cheap so within the day of the case falling off, my Fitbit was scratched. I hadn't even owned it a week. What's worse is that both of my hands are dominant for different reasons, so i have to mark the Fitbit as on my dominant hand, and Fitbit will still track trivial movements as steps. My heart rate is one of my two most important things. I like to track my activity to beat personal bests, even at work because i clean hotel rooms on the top floor. I love to watch my heart race after I've brought a 70lb. Bag of laundry up the stairs.. but I'll do that and it won't show my accurate heart rate. The old ones, i could rest a second and the tracker would catch up and show my rate, even if it slowed a bit while waiting. The versa 2 does nothing. I know my heart rate will be at least in the 140s and it'll rarely even show i broke the 100s. It is one of the single most important things i wanted in a tracker (heart rate, steps, and stairs climbed) and none of the things i wanted to know track accurately. I paid for something that can't even show one accurate stat. I realized i wasted over $200 the very first week of owning it.",3
0,"Have the watch two days. This versa 2 is junk. Does not read my heart rate 90% of the time. Woke up two mornings now and do not see any sleep records and no details on the different levels of sleep. What a waste of $200. The $27 China watch I bought a few weeks before I thought I was upgrading to this one, worked way better.Update 1/3/22: Battery only lasts 3 days at best. Outside temp says 70°F and it's actually 30°F. I tried everything to get the weather working and nothing works. If I sleep 8 hours and it does read my sleeping that night it will say maybe that I slept for 4 hours. Most of tue time it doesn't give me a sleep score and will say I slept an hour or 2. My Wifes Fitbit Versa 2 does all the same things mine does.They really need to do some serious software upgrades.It does tell the time though. LolI still say ""SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!""",1
1,"If you were a fan of the later Pebble smart watches, the Versa line is pretty much its spiritual successor. Fitbit acquired Pebble's intellectual property awhile back.I have been in the smartwatch game for years now, have had several Android Wear watches, and even an Apple Watch. I actually prefer the Versa over them all. The watch doesn't try to do it all which is actually a good thing. While it does have an app and watch face store, that is definitely not its strong suit. It keeps things simple being a tracker first with basic notifications.I like the always-on OLED display feature and days long battery life. Even when the battery does get low you could throw it on the charger for maybe 15 minutes and that's enough for a day's usage, give it an hour or so and it's basically fully charged.I would probably use the Fitpay option more if they supported my bank. I do not use the Alexa feature at all.One big plus that is nice about the Versa is that it pairs well with multiple phones at once. With the Apple Watch or Android Wear, you have to factory reset them in order to use with another phone. The Versa just works without much of a fuss. You don't even have to re-pair it. It doesn't even care if it's Android or iOS. It just starts working.",5
0,"I've been using this for about 1 year and 9 months now. At first it was fine but 6 months ago, the watch has behaved oddly.... After charging it, the following day, it will run out of battery by night time. But then, I charge it again and it will last a full week. The problem is that it is so inconsistent on this behavior that it is always unknown what it will do next.The heart rate monitor is also a bit off... I could be finishing off a very demanding squash rally and sometimes it reads 170 bpm, sometimes it will read 120 bpm... it is inconsistent.Disappointed.",2
0,"I cannot in good conscience recommend this product to anyone. The main reason I got this was because I could play music directly to my headphones and I wouldn't have to carry my phone on walks, runs or in the gym. The screen constantly locks up and requires 8 or 9 resets to get it to work. I go on with customer service and get the same troubleshooting answers every time. It is a very high maintenance piece of equipment. If you don't mind spending an hour to 2 hours every 48 hours resetting it over and over so that you can swipe through the various screens then this product is for you. If you want a low maintenance product go somewhere else.",1
1,As a fitness tracker and watch to wear on the daily that looks nice and feels comfortable the versa 2 is great. If you are expecting a smart watch like an apple watch then you'll be disappointed. So far I've had no technical issues with this and some features like the sleep tracking are very impressive. And the battery life is amazing compared to other watches. There are some things that arent so great. Like how you have to do everything through the phone app but i can live with that. It's half the price of a new apple watch. Note: this is my first fitbit or smart watch.,5
1,"Overall I really like the Versa 2. I like the size of the watch, the band for me is very comfortable, and I think its stylish.It tracks pretty well. I like the sleep tracker, and the steps, and the clock, date, etc. I paid more for the Versa 2 because I wanted Alexa. The idea is great and when its worked I love it as I use Alexa all the time. Unfortunately it will not connect most of the time, and constantly says its ""not connected"" to wifi. I would say 75% of the time it is not connected, and I mean several times a day. I also have never been able to get notifications or texts on this no matter what I try. I would rather pay less and get a Charge 3 without Alexa than pay more for this and not have it work. This is not unique to me so hopefully fitbit will get this fixed.",3
0,"Update: This has a one year warranty. That was up a week or two ago. The watch face literally fell off the body of the watch. Support can’t help, since it’s out of warranty and just gave me a 35% off coupon.Planned obsolescence? I don’t know. Poor workmanship? Yeah. I HIGHLY doubt the competing Garmin or Apple smart watches would have such a critical failure. I’m never buying a fitbit product again, if their expensive watches fail after just a year with no recourse.Id rather pay $50-100 more for a watch that is reliable and in the Apple ecosystem for example. At least now I would.———-This is a great fitness tracker, displays notifications, has some neat watch faces. It isn’t a smart watch first, it is a fitness tracker first. The data it provides is great, but to get more out of your data with deeper analytics you need to subscribe to Fitbit’s monthly premium plan.Only thing I didn’t like was a couple times it didn’t track my sleep, after a night of partying with friends etc where my heart rate was elevated even during sleep. It just didn’t think I was sleeping, even though I obviously was.",1
0,"Days 1 through 30: The Honeymoon Stage, Star Rating = 5 stars--------------------------------------------------------------------------Straight out of the box, everything worked flawlessly. I could add watch faces to my heart’s content, and I could add all kinds of apps and actually use them! I used the Starbucks app a number of times.Days 31 through 65: Some Apps Wouldn’t Work, Star Rating = 4 stars--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Some of the watch faces that were free had some defects in them, so I decided to stick with the watch faces that Fitbit had made. There were some apps that I couldn’t use, but for the most part, the overall functionality of the watch was satisfactory.Days 66 through 99: Resetting the Watch on a Daily Basis was Normal, Star Rating = 2.5 stars------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Many times a day, the screen would not show up while I tapped on the watch or flicked my wrist to see the watch, so I had to reset the watch at least 3 to 5 times a day, and most of the apps would not load.Days 100 through 122: The Versa 2 was a Large Tracker, Star Rating = 1 star----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I took it for granted that I could not load any of the apps, and the main Fitbit app also would not load. I had to recharge the Versa 2 watch at least two times a day. All it did was to keep track of my heart rate, the number of steps that I walked, and the number of floors that I went up. The floors feature did not reliably measure the actual amount of floors that I went up. It was also capable of measuring my sleep on a reliable basis.I have been a Fitbit member for many years. Since yesterday, I have moved on to another fitness watch made by a manufacturer that begins with the letter S. I still use the Fitbit website to keep track of my weight. I will miss being able to synchronize steps into the Fitbit ecosystem every day. As a long time Fitbit customer, I had purchased this watch on Amazon which came with free shipping, as I am a Prime member. When I found out that I had to pay to send the defective Fitbit Versa 2 back to Fitbit, I had decided at that time to move on. The Fitbit website is fantastic, but their hardware, especially their Versa 2 line is underpowered and its software is defective.",1
0,"Please read to the end. I have purchased 2 FitBit smartwatches/fitness tracker in the past 3 years. I initially bought the Fitbit Versa (1) followed by the FitBit Versa 2. Upon my first year with my purchase I really did enjoy my Versa, it was sleek, lightweight, fashionable, and had all the features necessary for someone looking for a health tracker. That was what initially grabbed my attention to Fitbit despite other smartwatches/fitness trackers on the market, I wanted something health focused without the add-ons I'd get on my cell phone. So for that, I can give them 5 stars. My first Versa tapped out unexpectedly at around the 2 year mark, the heart rate monitor no longer working. All other features of the watch worked but the heart rate monitor, not even the light was working. I called FitBit and they went through the motions of having me reset the watch and ultimately factory reset (Gee, why didn't I think of that myself -_-). Flash forward to the Versa 2 and the SAME EXACT ISSUES, only this time less than a year in! I called Fitbit for 3 consecutive days with very little help from those who assisted with my claim, but the kicker was the last agent I spoke with. He immediately pushed for the 35% another Fitbit since the ""1 year manufacturer warranty was up"". I had to further advocate for myself pushing for the protection plan I had purchased. (I should note I distinctly remember purchasing a protection plan for my original versa, which apparently never happened and ""could not be found on file"". Following this, FitBit passed me over to square trade and no longer has a say it what occurs next regarding my device. In a nutshell, I will no longer be purchasing any kind of FitBit device as they are simply not a good investment in the long run. Granted, this could be my personal experience, however, I find it odd that the malfunctioned heart rate monitor occurred 2x which is clearly an indication of poor manufacturing. Moreover, this also supports their infamous 1yr manufacturer warranty, knowing damn well that after a year the device will croak. I hope this was informative.",1
1,This is another great product from Fitbit. I really like the Alexa addition. This is replacing the original Versa but did take several hours to get sleep tracking and exercise to be available in the stats window.,5
0,"I enjoyed the product for about 15 minutes. I was able to successfully pair it. Then after 15 minutes the my phone could not longer sync with the device. I visited the fit bit website or troubleshooting, followed them to a T, and even did a factory reset to start the whole process again. The second time around I began the device set up. My phone said it found the device then started the setup process and suddenly reverted back to the message window suggesting I check that my device is charged and i that didn't work restart the blue tooth on my phone. Having done that 10-20 times before I decided I no longer wanted to deal with the hassle and requested a refund. I have never had such dificulty with a it bit product before.Now on to more practical things. The charging cradle is the most cumbersome and impracticable charging cradle I have ever seen on any tech period. It does not easily lay flat and is a true hassle to deal with. The face looks nice and I was able to change the clock face.Wish I could have gotten some practical use out of it.I really have come to my end on Fitbit from this experience.",1
0,"I have gone through a Charge 2, Versa Lite (failed due to water damage) and a Versa 2. I bought this Versa 2 on Dec 1 2019 here on Amazon and it lasted exactly until today (Nov 14 2020), so less than a year. The plastic backplate that is glued to the aluminum frame uses a pretty poor adhesive/sealant which lets water in. The same happens for some people with the screen detaching. Please, if you do buy a Versa 2 - which I don't recommend - do not expose it to water, sweat, humidity or anything liquid for that matter. They are not water resistant, much less swim proof. They will fail on you at about 1 year of usage and Fitbit's customer support is laughable. They sent me a replacement for my old Versa Lite and it was a used/refurbished watch.If you are an active person, exercise a lot, wash your car, jog in the rain, wash dishes, etc. go and buy a Garmin or Apple Watch, but stay away from Fitbit. Out of the 3 I have had, the only good one was the oldest Charge 2, probably because they had better quality control. Shame as I've spent probably more than $500 over the years in bands, watch faces and the watches themselves.",1
0,"The watch seems good as do the basic settings. Annoying that Fitbit has constant prompts to buy their program but same for all models. This is #4. I attached a metal band that needed to return due to clasp. -no problem. I cannot reattach the junky rubber one that came with the watch, bloody under fingernails & sore. I tried the videos but the rubber will not shrink & balancing that & pin is impossible for me. Now I have to go back to the loose clasp til another band can be tried. So frustrating! Why have they made this difficult? I do have some arthritis in hand. Makes it hard for me to like the versa. Cloth band works easiest but gets loose quickly. Got a magnetic band but cannot attach it. Done - this is Not a unit for anyone with the least bit of arthritis-Returning",2
0,"I've had it about a year now, and have been frustrated with it most of the time. It will not stay synced with anything most of the time, not my phone, tablet or PC. That means I can't use the Alexa app on it, which I don't need at home, but sometimes I want to use it (with my phone as the anchor) elsewhere. No joy, ever...Today the time is off by a couple of hours, so I spent over an hour trying to get it synced with either my phone or tablet. Once again... no joy. I disabled the skill in the Alexa app after I fiddled with the app for over an hour I almost destroyed the watch out of anger and frustration. If it won't work, why have it. I finally deleted the watch in the Fitbit app and re-synced it as a new watch. The time was corrected, but now (and always) I can't pair it with Alexa because the watch won't sync with my phone's Bluetooth. I jucking give up. and will just toss it in a drawer from now on.The ONLY thing I like about it is the sleep tracker which other than how I feel in the morning and how restless I was the night before, it gives me an idea of how much actual sleep I got.",1
0,"I purchased the Fitbit 2 with Alexa built in. The screen is totally frozen, no touch capability at all. It's still tracking and counting, but I have to use the app on my cell to get any of the data. As with any step counter, the exercise tracking is not accurate; the heart/pulse function is totally accurate. It just would be nice to be able to read the information while I'm actually exercising, as opposed to getting the report later from my cell. The battery life is quite long, because the screen doesn't work, and so is never drawing juice. Very disappointing product.",1
0,"I actually like the device. However, pray that you never need to use the warranty. I've had to go through the process TWICE for the same device. Each time, I was without the watch for at least a month. First, you'll have to prove that you've gone through several troubleshooting steps. These steps may include changing watch faces, removing apps, and waiting several days. I know the call center employees are just following a script but the procedure itself is needlessly convoluted.For my first warranty return, the watch face just suddenly stopped working. Otherwise, it was still working--communicating with my phone and tracking everything. Sadly, I need the primary watch function to work and invoked the return. Bam! No Fitbit for a month. I received what was likely a refurbished device, not the repaired original.For my second warranty return, the battery suddenly stopped holding a charge. It would completely discharge in less than a 24 hour period, disrupting my sleep tracking, etc. According to FedEx, as of writing this the watch is floating around somewhere in Southern California, where it's been for about a week and a half after being in transit for nearly month total. There's no way they'll process and ship it back to me within one month of me sending it to them.In summary, for the one year warranty period since my original purchase in mid-June 2020, I'll have been without it for two months total. I feel like that shouldn't be. Sadly, I really like the device overall. I just wish it were more reliable and/or the warranty wasn't so cumbersome. I'd settle for either.",2
0,"To be fair - I loathe the software on this device. My main use was to use this for swimming laps. It is fairly accurate but not dead on. Lap counts vary by about 10% from actual in a 25yd pool. I haven't been able to figure this out. That is ok however and not what spurs me to write a hate review.The software for this - on the device, on my iphone and on the web is just really annoying to the point of maddening. On the device I'd like to customize the display so it works with the way I use the device and to better suit my aging eyes. I believe this to be theoretically possible but practically impossible. Thus I have to wade through all sorts of options that I'll never use to get to the few options that I do use. Also it means that I can't see my lap counts or distance or time per lap while I'm in the pool.Likewise the iphone app constantly pushes a ton of information and options at you that you'll never want to use but that you have scroll through or decline to get to the things that you do want to know or do. What is maddening about this is that there is often no (obvious, if at all) option to permanently decline stuff or to get the things you want more easily accessible.I have a Garmin for running and I've used a TomTom in the past. I can't wait for enough time to pass so that I can trash my Versa and move to a different product line. FitBit software seems to be designed and driven by sales staff (purchase this new service!) and not by athletes using the products.",1

1,"Bought these a few months back. Husband & I both upgraded from the Blaze.Pros:1. Amazon Alexa built in is great for timers, reminders, alarms, and adding shopping list items2. Smart wake picks the time you are on light sleep in the 30 minutes before your alarm so waking up is less jarring3. Vibrate alarm let's your spouse sleep if you get up at different times4. Heart rate tracking is better than older models5. Nice variety of clock faces to choose from in app. I just switched to the one that shows O2 stats because I have asthma and was interested6. Basic apps can be clever & useful if you keep their limitations in mind7. Text alerts on watch work well. Voice to text responses are great.8. Move reminders, step alerts, etc are nice and not annoying9. Lots of other features that I'm forgetting are greatCons :1. Not a full smart watch if that's what you want - limited app choices & functionality2. Band irritated my skin. I replaced it with a cloth one that has been perfect3. Alexa app doesn't work perfectly. Mine keeps asking me to re-pair with phone app, so I have to go get my phone, which defeats the purpose.",5
1,"Very reluctantly, I had to admit that my 2nd Pebble Round was no longer worth nursing along. The battery was done, and support for the product long since ended.Versa 2, with its fairly low price point, 3+ day battery life, heart rate tracking, and ability to verbally respond to texts - plus use most Alexa features - seemed like a decent replacement. (Pebble's ability to respond to texts was one of its major selling points, until the feature died with the product support!)Unfortunately, after wearing it for about 10 weeks, I remain underwhelmed.Let's start with the good, though* Battery life really is in the 3 day range* Bright, legible display. I found a decent free watch face that displays on an angle, so your arm can stay at a more natural one.* Comfortable strap, nice look overall.* I don't really have a baseline for sleep or heart rate tracking, but it seems to work fine.But now, the not so good.* Connectivity to my Moto Z Play is spotty at best. Unlike the Pebble with its bluetooth icon right on the watch face, the watch itself gives you few indications about whether it's communicating with your phone. Your first clue is usually when you hear your phone binging, but realize you got no corresponding buzz on your wrist.Long story short, my experience is that once connectivity is lost, rebooting the phone is my only option. No amount of begging for a re-sync through the app, or even force-quitting the app is going to cut it.I doubt I've ever gone 24 hours without losing connectivity either - frankly, I think simply stepping out of Bluetooth range is enough to kill it most of the time.I know this works better on other phones, but as I am not looking to replace my beloved Moto Z, this is cold comfort.* When everything is connecting nicely, the voice-to-text feature works pretty well. Except that sometimes it gives every indication of having sent your text, but it never actually makes it out of the ether. I won't venture to guess how frequently it fails, because frankly I don't get to use the feature (for the reason above) enough to have a good idea.* The app itself is not particularly intuitive. I know I've bought into the Fitbit ecosystem here, and that the same app does for many devices. But I wish it were a bit more device-centric and spent less time trying to upsell me on premium features.At first, the app was crashing constantly, and noisily, several times a day. An update sometime in late January or early February (to the firmware?) seems to have addressed that. Now it just doesn't really like to sync. :)* I seriously question the step-count. I have GoogleFit installed on my phone. My Pebble's step count and the phone's step count were always within single-digit percents of each other, unless of course I'd put the phone down for long periods of exercise.The Versa 2 on the other hand consistently reports a step count 20% higher than my phone.Without a lot more research and motivation I obviously can't prove which device is more accurate, but let's just say the Versa is the ""minority report."" The minor attention I've paid to the issue suggests that the Versa picks up and counts a lot more random non-walking movement than the Pebble, as the phone and watch seem to stay in closer agreement when I am actually on a long walk. (Oh, and while we're at it, wouldn't it be nice if the Versa could sync with Google Fit?!)To sum up, I would Happily add a fourth star if this silly watch just stayed connected with the phone without all the drama of silent failures and annoying reboots. But as it stands, I have found myself less and less motivated to do those reboots and just lived with a largely crippled watch, without consistent and reliable access to many of the features that I was most looking forward to, and - I might add - just Worked on the Pebble.",3
1,"I LOVE my Fitbit. I haven’t had any issues and I’ve been wearing it for about 1-2 weeks. I like that you’re not limited to what workouts you do and I was able to get rid of other fitness apps on my phone that were solely used to track one workout versus multiple. The FitBit app is really informative and right now I have the Fitbit premium trial, which ends in April, however I don’t see my self keeping it. I think the standard app by itself is great. I love how I can set my alarm directly on the watch, change music, pay with my FitBit, and it even gives me reminders to drink water or walk around. As for individuals who have experienced chemical burns, I personally have not. I recommend not wearing the watch in the shower and cleaning it with a Clorox wipe at least once a week. The charge also lasts me at least 3-5 days and I just put it on the charger when I shower. The only thing that annoyed me was the price dropped 3 days after I purchased🙃 it was only a $20 difference, but with the ongoing pandemic, that’s a lot to a broke girl 😂 but I didn’t want to deal with the return and reordering process. So if you see it on sale, BUY IT! You will not regret it. It keeps me so motivated and you can easily see your tracked workouts in the app. Also my favorite color is baby pink and this watch matches my aesthetic so perfectly 💕",5
0,"I am very disappointed with this fitbit versa 2, connecting is always an intermittent problem, the sleep tracking leaves a lot to be desired. I think they know there is a problem with the bands, they a place to make a claim on their website just for broken bands....been trying to get my calendar to sync since I received it. wont happen....will update on how fitbit handles this claim.Feb. 25, 2020 update:Received my replacement from fitbit yesterday, 15 days to get a new band here. and guess what? It is not the band that came with the watch!!! I did upload pictures to fitbit for the warranty process. I guess they could not see that it was a STANDARD FITBIT BAND!! I spent another 30 mins today with fitbit online chat to explain to them what I received and what I wanted. the tech help was trying to interrogate me. finally after I said you are making this harder than it needed to be. so, now I am waiting for the next slow boat from china for the correct band.fyi, I did actually try to locate the standard fitbit band for the versa 2 online I did after looking for 20 mins find one! and only one.......FITBIT HAS A PROBLEM WITH THIS BAND DESIGN........WOULD NOT BUY IT AGAIN.UPDATE 4/2/2020: now 4 months old, I can easily confirm that fitbit versa 2 has a connect problem, if i leave it in update all day it will work, but then it totally drains the battery on the watch and my cell phone. so I only do the sync manually now and it is a constant battle to get the watch to connect and sync.......once again I am sorry i Have bought this junk......UPDATE 5/27/2020FITBIT UPDATE 3 DAYS AGO,  now at version: 35.70.8.0, ever since the update I cannot turn off syncing!! I contacted tech support via chat on my phone and after going round and round with the tech, he finally admitted that the latest update removed the possibility of doing manual syncing......his reason was they wanted to give us a better experience with fit bit!!! the real problem is that now it will sync all day and all night and the battery is shot in 3 days, also drains the battery on my phone. his fix for this was to turn off the blue tooth on my phone! I cannot do that as the phone is connected to a heart device.  I am so sorry to be stuck with this fit bit device, will never recommend or deal with fit bit products again.",1
1,"For some reason, my original Versa REALLY didn't like my Pixel 4. It had worked with my original Pixel and Pixel 2 (no idea if it worked on the 3) and I didn't anticipate any problems with the 4. While it was really disappointing, I grabbed the V2 when it was on sale in the hopes that it might work better with my phone with the full intention of returning it if I had the exact same connectivity problems I was having with the original every few hours.Fortunately... no problems at all! The battery life feels as if it's lasting much longer and putting a new clock face on it didn't take upwards of an hour trying to convince the watch to sync and update. Just works. The Alexa connectivity is really nice since my voice isn't that loud and it's difficult to get Alexa to understand me when I'm in bed or not close to the device. Notifications work well, and while I haven't tested it's music functionality yet (as I use my Mp3 player for that) I imagine it would work just as well.Overall, I'm very satisfied.",5
0,I bought this because I can get texts and especially because of 5 day battery life. I also wanted to get texts and use Alexa. I have now getting rid of almost every app on it so the battery “might” last just thru the day. Most times I have to plug it in during the day. The main thing I use it for is to use during hiking and gps. It would not last Thru a hike. It would die. I got hacked so I wasn’t able to get on to my account to send it back. I have to use my 5 year old tracker if I want it when I am awake all day and work all night. I loved my last fitbit and am surprised this one is t as awesome,1

Hopefully it will just completely fail soon so I have a reason to get a different monitor and app.Even the basics of steps and heart rate and the real purpose of the monitor are unreliable. I work in surgery and when I remove the monitor to use to be in surgical gloves, it somehow manges to measure my heart rate (which suddenly jumps to more than 150/minute) and my steps, even though I am just standing it will credit me with taking at least 600 steps that hour.Provides completely bogus metrics with inferior technology.Keep looking for something better than what FitBit can provide.Even the website interface is is not very intuitive. Many markings for different functions but can not find any list or directions of what the markings mean. Trying to whittle through the ""support"" pages is not helpful. Real support from FitBit personnel is virtually non-existent and you are left having to read through 100's or 1000's of comments to try to find any help from other consumers, not company help. The forum is usually filled with numerous others complaining about the same problem, but no one having any solution. The compnay only provdies faulty updates that require several more updates when the rollout causes the unit to stop functioning.Update: Abondoning this monitor forever as of today. New glitch as monitor keeps restarting itself every minute. Now it can't provide heart rate, steps, or time.Where can I recycle it?",1
1,"Having owned a Fitbit charge and a Fitbit flex I thought I would really like the Versa 2. As far as being a Fitbit it is ok.....but there are several things I don't like about it. First, the size. It is a lot bigger than my previous Fitbits and tends to bump against my wrist bones. Second, the battery life isn't great. I have to charge mine every other day (yes, I don't have the features on that lower battery life). Finally, the band is hard to get on and off. I liked my other Fitbits b/c I could change my band and have one band for work (which has a lot of dirt and water) and one for home. It takes about 5-10 mins just to put a different band on. Other than that it is a good Fitbit but I think I will purchase a different Fitbit next time.",3
1,"I've tried a few smart watches to help me stay on track with exercising daily since this is a new task for me. My first phone wasn't fully compatible (being that it's only tested on certain devices) then I got a new phone now it works great!It is a bit tricky if you don't go into the watch itself on the app. That's where the bulk of the settings are to enable most of it's functions.I love that it tracks my sleep being I have issues falling asleep. It let's me know approximately what time I dozed & for how long.It appears to be fairly accurate being a watch not an actual medical device but that is a factor so we must keep that in mind.I would recommend the Versa 2, it's very handy with a lot of cool accessories to look like u have multiple watches! 😍The only thing I don't like is that it doesn't do little cool things like take a picture or control the music like other watches I've tried ( at least not with my phone) & a squat counter as u go as I've seen on other watches but I still love it because has all the main functions u need a smart watch for.The Fitbit app with the monthly premium is awesome. I am not of FB, IG, Twitter etc but I love the Fitbit Community it's also motivates you to keep going and going! 😆",5
0,"I’ve only had my versa 2 since May and ever since I change the face I’ve had nothing but problems. And when I tried to change the face back to the original I get this blank screen not sure what to do at this point.Update as of April 30, 2021.I really thought I had a lot of faith in Fitbit. When the first incident happened they replaced it no problem. It really gave me a lot of confidence in the brand so much so that I even bought stock in it.But after this I’m not so sure. So I’ve been out of the game (not able to where my watch) since the beginning of the week..under 1 year and my Fitbit seems to fall part. Like many people I wear my Fitbit every single day. And the only time I don’t wear it is while I’m in the shower and it is charging. It is been great for the last 11 months. The first time I tried to update it the screen went blank it wouldn’t turn on. Now the seal has broken off from the frame and Fitbit won’t replace it because of The replacement band that I got because their band was not small enough for my wrist. They did not even make any recommendations as to how to fix it. So what am I supposed to do ? Has anybody ran across this issue where the seal has broken? what have you done? I really like Fitbit but at this point they’re forcing me to get an Apple Watch… my husband has had his for three years and nothing has happened it!!😭😡",2
0,"This is not an apple watch which we all know you buy bc you don't want to pay an apple watch price. Or you just hate apple but can't let go of the iPhone. Both of those are me. But this watch functions like crap. The pictures are where my battery is after a full charge last evening. When you're working with a new iPhone and you know Apple then you're gonna be disappointed with this ""watch."" Trust me. Save up if you need to and get an apple watch even if it's a past gen. You'll regret saving $150 on this piece of ""whatever"" that wants to be an apple watch but never will be.",1
0,"I purchased the Fitbit Versa 2 to replace my Fitbit Surge which I purchased several years ago. I love the Surge but it is a bit of a clunky fitness tracker and would routinely get caught up in my jacket or shirt sleeve. After researching for several weeks I chose the Versa 2. When I received this fitness tracker I was immediately impressed by the style and the comfort of the fitness tracker. Set up was easy and the fitness tracker looked great. I really liked some of the new features such as the fitbit pay and the alexa. I wore it for a couple of days and found that the watch strap kept falling off. I made several attempts to re-attache the strap without success. After several frustrating minutes of attempting to re attach the strap it would fall off the fitness tracker. I have large hands so I took it to some female acquaintances who have smaller and more dexterous hands to see if they could re-attach the watch strap. No success. The thought was that the watch or the pin on the strap is defective. I tried again by watching You Tube videos but was still not able to attach the strap. I could see no visible damage to the strap or the watch itself and concluded that it could not be re-attached. Obviously, the fitness tracker without the strap is not acceptable which is why I gave the Versa 2 two stars. For the short time that I was able to wear the Versa 2 it seemed to accurately record the various fitness features. I was really hoping that this fitness tracker would be an upgrade to my Surge. As I said earlier the fitness tracker looks great and has many great features but I think I am going to look at other fitness trackers in the future. The product was returned to Amazon.",2
1,"I've had a couple of Fitbits that had pretty short lives for some reason where the battery just refused to charge. I was replacing my second Charge HR and wanted to get a waterproof unit that could handle lap swimming. I looked at an Apple iWatch and this Versa 2 Fitbit. While the Apple had more features, I did not want to be tethered to having to charge the iWatch every 18 hours. That was a real dealbreaker for me. The Versa 2 lasts for days. I have been as long as 5 days without charging it and it probably would have gone another day (the Fitbit was nearly new). I do charge it daily while I take a shower and that is enough to keep it charged in the 70-95% range. I wear my Fitbit to bed every night to track sleep and swim in the pool with no problem. The touchscreen on the Versa2 is convenient as there are apps available for barcodes (I use mine for getting in the YMCA, well, at least I did when we could go the YMCA). You can also put a Starbucks app on the Versa2 so you can pay without having your phone or cash and an number of other apps. It doesn't have built in GPS like the iWatch does (some of them) so you must have your phone with you to use that feature. The Fitbit app on the iPhone has some issues. Texts and calls show up on the Versa2, but you can't respond to texts from the Fitbit if you have an iPhone. I hear that you can with an Android phone. Maybe I will change to Android the next time I upgrade my phone. All in all, very happy with the Versa2 so far. Hopefully the Versa2 will last longer than the Charge HRs which both died before 2 years of use.",5
1,"This is the second wrist monitor I’ve owned and this one so far is well worth it. My first was horribly inaccurate and I ditched it in a week, you get what you pay for and it was cheap. It uses heart rate to monitor activity and predict calorie burn. I have found using it in conjunction with Cronometer to log my food and found this to be very beneficial. I was trying to slowly lose about 20 lbs over the last few months and literally landed on my goal weight today thanks to this device.The good-it logs all sorts of activity that you may have not realized contributed to calorie burn. It logs sleep and gets somewhat close, sometimes it thinks I’m sleeping when I’m just being morbidly lazy. It encourages you to get up and move every hour which is good. It updates fast. It auto logs exercise if it thinks your working out after 10 minutes of an activity(it knows when I’m biking vs running). For me it has been pretty much accurate however I’m already in good shape and that plays a role in the monitoring of heartbeat.The Bad- honestly not much, keep in mind again it uses heart rate so while a healthy person doing an activity retains a lower heart rate than someone who is unhealthy they will likely be burning more calories than is registered. Likewise an inactive person’s heart rate will increase rapidly with less movement providing a higher perceived calorie burn when it is in fact lower. You’ll have to play around with it.Overall I recommend it for anyone trying to lose weight, gain weight, or just keep track of activity.",5
1,"I love the Versa Watches because I am a lifeguard (formerly coronavirus decided to shut down my pool) but It was perfect for me when I was lifeguarding every day jumping in the water and swimming my laps. You can stay in the water for a long time with it on I use it while I tread water for 30 minutes and it works just fine after. This is way better than Apple Watches in my opinion.When I heard the Versa 2 had Alexa I had to buy it immediately. I don't know why I thought she would be able to talk to me through a speaker but there is no speaker. You have to read the screen but it works just like a regular Alexa except for no sound! I love it!The ONLY problem I have with the Fitbit is the weird RASH both Versa 1 and 2 have given me. I think it's the band, I haven't bothered buying a separate band because it doesn't hurt or itch at all it just seems irritated. Maybe I am allergic to the type of latex or plastic or whatever they use for the band but It doesn't bother me It's just unflattering. The Fitbit people say to take the band off sometimes so I usually take my band off once a day to wash the band and my wrist but it doesn't do anything to help it go away so I just constantly suffer but I really don't care.Cool watch!!!!",5
1,"FITBIT overall score: 2 stars. I'm going to put this out there..... I am not a fan of fitbit. I think it's crap that you have to pay extra for services they advertise. I get it if they have extra stuff like coaches and videos, but the tracker related stuff should not be charged for. I tried the premium membership and I prefer beachbody workout on my TV than the tiny screen on my phone giving me a workout.... and if I was traveling and had no choice, I could still use my beachbody app. The only feature that I would have used is the sleep insights and I am not going to pay for a membership to use one feature that I don't really care about. I also dislike the fact that they hype you up and act like they will consider a new feature and I have yet to see them implement a single feature I have voted for. They leave it under consideration for months and then say 'nope'. Their reminders to move feature is only useful if you're a total couch potato and want to be reminded to get up for the last 10 minutes of your hour. I wanted to use it to remind me to move if I haven't reached my own hourly goal.... you're stuck with their 250 step hourly goal. You can't change when the reminder to move goes off either. Sooo, say I want to set an hourly goal of 1000 steps, the reminder to move sounded 10 minutes before the end of the hour (and only if I haven't taken 250 steps) By the time I could find the graph with my hourly steps and mouse over each section to get the actual count and then add up each count, my 10 minutes was almost up. If I can't change the 250 step count, it's not motivating me to move MORE than I already do. If I can't change when to remind me, then I don't have a chance of completing it. What if my work break is at the beginning of the hour and I forgot to take my steps? The ability to change the hourly step goal and the reminder times are a simple fix and Fitbit closes their ears to people.On my fitbit charge 3, I had a work around and set a silent alarm on the fitbit app to remind me to complete my own step goal. This was fun, because I had to write down the steps I had already taken for the day and then get my steps in. I spent more time sitting in front of my computer trying to figure out how many steps I took than I did actually taking steps some day. The funny thing is, on the versa 2, it actually does show me my steps this hour... but only until I reach the 250 step goal and then I am back to using the graph on my phone again. Now the even funnier thing is, Fitbit has removed this feature of setting silent alarms on the app. At least for the Versa 2. I googled where it was and searched for THREE hours, it's no longer there. I even watched a video that was on youtube showing it was there two months ago, but when I followed the steps, my screen didn't match up with the video. I can set a silent alarm from my watch, but only 8 alarms total, so I can't set an alarm to go off each hour for 12 hours to get 1000 steps each hour...... And the hours I need it to go off changes depending on the day of the week. The other feature complaint is the 'relax feature' I like it, BUT you can only set it for 2 or 5 minutes.... why the restriction? Why can't I pick 10? 15? Set my own? It's not relaxing to reset it every 5 minutes for 15 minutes.My final complaint with fitbit (there really are more, but these are the biggest ones), the user manual within the app is USELESS. Take the above example of silent alarms. If I go to the 'how to use' section and click on silent alarm section, you would expect a walk through of how to set a silent alarm, right? No, this is literally what is says: Silent alarms: Set a silent alarm on Versa 2. Your device gently vibrates to wake you up in the morning or alert you at a certain time of day. If you don't dismiss an alarm, it goes off again in 9 minutes. (Btw, when I got the charge 3, it took FOREVER to figure out how to dismiss a silent alarm instead of snoozing it). And this is how the entire 'how to use' portion is on the app. It's all a description on what each feature is used for, no instructions on how to set it up. Notifications? Timers? Alarms? Quick Replies? Weather?Be prepared to google search how to do EVERYTHING other than how to remove the wrapping from your watch.So why the 5 stars? Well, I knew when I bought this watch that I think fitbit trackers are the dumbest of the trackers. BUT when I got the Charge 3, I had a newborn baby. I was going to return it the day I bought it, however I discovered one redeeming quality.... it will notify me by vibrating when I have a call. I am on the clock 24 hours a day and when you have a newborn baby, the phone ringing is frustrating. Missed calls when the phone was on silent. So the notifications and quick replies gave me a reason to keep it. So I can't give a crappy review of fitbit on this device when I knew going in that it wasn't going to be what I wanted for a tracker. I gave it a crappy review on the Charge 3.But this time, I bought this one due to Alexa being on the watch. I have a Fire TV, an echo show, 2 echo dots, a kindle fire and a kindle paperwhite, (earbuds are on the way) I am a prime member and I have several subscribe and save items. My whole world is tied together on this watch. My packages come? Shopping list? Whatever reminders I setup through Alexa comes on my watch too. I can watch my workout on the firetv and if the baby needs me, press the button on my watch and have it pause the TV.... I can't tell you how many times I have had to look for the remote in the baby's toybox just to pause the tv, then rewind and pause.... lol. I know that amazon music is not tied to the versa, I am hopeful that Amazon flexes a little muscle and gets it. Or google buys fitbit out and uses common sense and adds it as a feature. But the notifications from my phone, the link to Alexa were enough for me to upgrade from the Charge 3. I have found I like the clock faces for the versa 2 and the ability to see more of my stats from the watch and less looking at the app. And being able to have Alexa log my food on myfitnesspal for me is nice too.Ok, one final complaint about fitbit..... versa 2 has Alexa.... common sense to have amazon music, right? Nope they must be getting money from Spotify and Deezer to keep it off there. But I am not paying for a second service for music when I get amazon music with everything else I need, shipping, movies, tv shows, smart house controls.UPDATE: disappointed with bluetooth range. The watch disconnects from my phone a lot. I know that some of this is the phone, however my apartment is small and my Charge 3 never lost connection while I was home. I sit my phone on my desk to keep it out of reach of my toddler and rely on my watch to notify me if I have a call (can't hear the ringer with the toddler and kids). Realistically, I am usually within 10 feet of my phone 90% of the time, 15 feet if I am in the kitchen. I will go to use spotify from my kitchen and it will tell me connection is lost.",4
0,"the Good news is this watch is very nice looking and seems to be well made.The bad news I tried to change the band from the small to the large. the pin was to be pushed and I got the watch band off, however, the pin is so small to work with and I could not get the larger band on. The holes that you insert the pin into are tiny a hard to see. My older Fitbit all you did was snap out and snap in. A senior citizen or a person with a hand disability would never be able to change a band. Somethings don’t need to changed. I am returning the watch and do not plan to repurchase.",2
1,"Formalities: The watch was delivered on time, and in new condition. Box was sealed and no signs of damage. Now that all that jazz is out of the way.I used to wear a Samsung Gear watch to go with my phones, but I just couldn't pinpoint why I didn't care for them. It bugs me, but I just didn't like wearing those watches, so I switched to a FitBit.The FitBit Versa 2. I ordered the Grey wristband version and I really liked the light grey color of the silicone bands. However, like a few other people mentioned, the silicone bands weren't for me. I shower/clean myself daily and wash the wrist bands separately every morning before wearing. Even though I took precautions, I still developed a very itchy, open sore/rash. To fix this problem I ordered separate Grey wristbands right here from Amazon that are like a fabric texture ($13 for both small and large bands) that are 100 times easier to connect to the watch than the original bands by the way. No more rash, and they are extremely comfortable.Setup/App/Functionality:Setting up the watch is straightforward. Charge the watch. Download the app. Turn on watch. Follow prompts. Very easy to follow and very easy to connect watch to Wi-Fi.Functionality wise, this watch provides enough information. Steps. Heart rate. Obviously the time, etc. However, this watch does not have the ECG/EKG function. It has plenty of watch faces you can download, free or for a buck or two. Please note that some watch face creators actually have it where if you purchase a face and install, but want to change up to a new face and choose to go back to the one you just uninstalled, you will have to purchase that watch face AGAIN to re-install again if you want to go back to it. Pretty grimey, but it is what it is, I guess. Battery lasts about 2 days or so. It really depends on how you have your personal settings set up. Lastly, as I am sure everyone else that owns a smart watch has determined this, but if you are using the watch to gain exact measurements, heart rate, actual steps, I wouldn't go by this. My actual resting heart rate and what the watch displays are two totally different numbers, and the watch counts driving (turning the steering wheel) as steps. I use the numbers from the watch as a baseline.The App:I have an S21 Ultra, so Android version of the App. I, personally, find the Android look of the app to be, well, just better looking than the iOS version. I have the Android phone, she has an iPhone. The layouts are slightly different, so it will just boil down to user preference. The App can prove difficult when trying to find some things, like attempting to change the time from standard to 24HR or military time. It requires taking a few different avenues, but once you figure it out, it's easy to remember.I already voiced my sort of gripes above with the watch face schemes, my personal experience with the silicone bands, and the accuracy of the steps and heart rate, but other than those things, this watch looks and feels great! I'm a larger man, and doing a pushup with my thick forearms, they don't press the single power button on the left side of the face over and over 🙃. For that, I am grateful.I cannot compare this to the other Fitbit watches. She has a Versa lite, which I feel has the same footprint as my Versa 2. Other than that, I like this watch. If you were considering this watch and it has been sitting in your list or cart for a while, go ahead and get it. Just remember the option for different material wristbands if the silicone bands give you trouble, or just preemptively purchase the other bands at the same time.Stay healthy my friends!",5
1,"To begin with the pros. The watch is beautiful, my mom had one in the past and I wanted one. So far the interface is smooth and it's fairly accurate. I haven't gotten random steps when I'm sleeping or when the watch is off. I've been checking it Everytime I get up and the steps remain the same as when I sit down. My bpm is about the same as when I test it myself, so it's as accurate as you can get without a chest strap.For the cons I'll start with saying the watch is not waterproof, my mom fried her old one but using it in the hot tub and I won't take the chance with mine. When I set it up it desynced which made it confusing but it fixed itself within 30 minutes. The strap it comes with is super uncomfortable and I bought an after market one. With the new straps it's super balanced and I barley notice it's on. Also it's kinda slow. It's smooth when going through the interface but if I clicked on an app or a widget it takes a solid 30 seconds to load up. Lastly when I first set it up my Alexa and my speech to text didn't work after uninstalling and reinstalling the app it fixed it, but I can't help but think the software is just buggy.Overall I'd still recommend this product for a $200 fitness tracker / smart watch it does it's job. It's more accurate than Samsung's watch even tho it's features and software aren't as polished. If you want a fitness tracker get this watch. If you just want a smart watch look somewhere else.",3
0,"I had the Charge HR 2 and LOVED it! It never gave me any issues and I had it for 3 years.I bought my gf the Versa, then she bought me the Versa 2. We had to replace her Versa twice because it wasn't waterproof as claimed, the second time was after the one year warranty so we were out of luckI'm constantly having issues with my Versa 2. I can't answer calls on the Versa 2 like I could when I first got it, I'm constantly having to try to get texts on my watch even though it vibrates when I get calls. It's gotten buggy a few times and I've had to do a factory reset.I shouldn't have to troubleshoot a $200 fitness tracker 3-4 times a year. I miss my Charge HR 2. I had it 3 years and it never gave me these issues. I'll be looking for a different brand going forward.",2
0,"I have had the watch a week now. I call it a watch because that is all it really is. Sure it tracks steps but there are $29.00 trackers with good ratings on here that tell time and track steps. I chose the Versa 2 mainly because of its Sleep Score feature. The second and third night I wore it to bed I actually got a Sleep Score but have not since then. I've not been sleeping well and I was planning on this providing some insight into the timing of my various sleep stages. After much searching on the Fitbit blogs I find many others have this problem, i.e., No Sleep Score as promised. It is even printed on the box. The only answer I could find from a developer was and I quote, ""some of you in some locations ""MAY"" receive a Sleep Score. May receive???? Then this feature should not be printed on the box nor advertised here on Amazon. Secondly, I understood that as a new owner of a Fitbit tracker I was to receive a 90 day free trial of Fitbit Premium so I researched how to activate it. The Fitbit blog led me to ""click on the Premium tab on my mobile app BUT THERE IS NO PREMIUM TAB, hence my one star rating of the very poor Fitbit mobile app. So I went to the Fitbit website and logged on. I saw my dashboard there but of course still no Sleep Score. Thinking Fitbit would recognize I was a new device owner if I purchased Premium through the website whilst signed in I would get my free 90 day trial. Nope. They charged my card the full $9.99 for a one month subscription and guess what? STILL NO SLEEP SCORE. Save yourself the trouble and buy another brand. Mine is going back. I'd give it zero stars if there was that option.",1
1,"I had been debating which Fitbit to purchase for a little while. I am glad that I’ve gone with the Versa 2 model.It’s a great smart watch for those like me who don’t need all of the bells and whistles of an Apple Watch. It’s motivated me to move more now that I see the steps I take each day. Sometimes I question the accuracy of the steps but mostly I think it’s true. I like that it logs my workouts and love the timer feature. It’s nice to have that even for cooking, face masks, and other everyday tasks.The sleep tracking is really interesting. I still feel like I need to learn more about it but it’s encouraged me to try to start having better sleep habits.The main con: I really don’t like that the app wants to be open in the background at all times. This would kill my phone battery and data, so I haven’t done this. But it seems like the watch works better and some functions are only available if you let it. I hadn’t known this before hand and so wish I had.I still have to play with a lot of features and figure it out more. But I am happy with this watch and hope I can get better functionality out of it.",4
0,The fitbit was great for tracking my sleep and my exercise routines. BUT it fell apart in less than a year! The face fell out and would not snap back in. I'm so disappointed because I paid almost $300 for my model hoping that it was a cut above the rest. I now have to purchase another smart watch but I doubt it will be a Fitbit after my disastrous experience.,1
1,"I absolutely loved this product and the app for about 6 months but then it stopped syncing to my phone saying I need an app for the device?! I tried all troubleshooting, restarting, deleting and redownloading but nothing works. I looked into it online and dozens of reviews reflect the same problem and Fitbit is doing nothing about it. What a waste of money! $200 for a device that does not track amd sync your infor to look at?! I could get a cheap $40 watch for this garbage. I am so irritated with this.* I am revising my rating after getting ahold of customer service and having a replacement shipped. Hopefully this solves the problem.",4
1,"I love a lot of things about this watch, but there's a huge flaw that brings it down to 3 stars for me. When you are in exercise mode, you can't get out of the exercise mode screen to use other functions of the watch without stopping your exercise session altogether. I would love to be able to see what time it is, use the stopwatch, change the song that's playing, look at the temperature, etc. while it is still recording me as in the middle of an exercise. I probably have 10 exercise sessions that are recorded as only 0:30 because I needed to view something on another screen, but I am forced to stop the exercise to exit that screen.That said, if there is a way to do the above, and I'm just not getting it right, I would love to be informed and will gladly change my rating.Some great things about the watch: IT TRACKS YOUR SLEEP. So cool. It will show you text messages (if it's a really long one, it will be cut off, but I'm not a huge fan of reading a novel on a 2 inch screen) and you can reply with voice to text. You can listen to music (with earbuds) and control the player with minimal functions (again, you can't do this while in exercise mode, which is super annoying since that's the main time I would need that function). There is a lot more that I'm leaving out, but I'm pretty sure they are well covered in the description and other reviews.",3
0,"My Versa 2 stopped working after only one year and two months of service. The watch hardware has been maintained in excellent condition and is behaving as if boot firmware is corrupt. I worked with support people at Fitbit over a few sessions with no solution. Support was only able to provide a 35% discount on a new replacement. This is not sufficient after I originally paid $229 when it first came out. I have been a Fitbit user for over 7 years but will now consider other options once my older Fitbit Charge 2, I reverted to wears out.Detailed DescriptionMy Versa 2 stopped working and only intermittently re-pairs with the smartphone app. (after manually unpairing from the App) and then only goes to the watch screen when the battery level becomes very low. It otherwise hangs and goes into an infinite loop on the logo pairing screen indicated by the logo animation is stopping and restarting partly through the animation. When I observe the watch running in this state, the battery is quickly depleted and the device then transitions to the watch main screen with the battery state critically low. No method was offered to re-flash boot loader firmware.",1
1,"I'm a fan so far. It seems to track everything well. I did have a little trouble getting to sync with the app the 1st time, but once I restarted the watch it worked fine. I've had 1 other instance of it having trouble syncing so that is a bit worrisome since it's only a few months old, but other than that I'm happy with it. I changed out the band which I had read could be tricky, but had no problems. The battery life is good & it's definitely helped me stay more fitness oriented the last few months. It also helps with not getting distracted by my phone when I'm with others since I can quickly check to see if a notification is important. The new update includes a find my phone feature too which I've already used several times.",5
1,"This is the best buddy to help keep you honest and on track. I purchased it for my son and it started a Competitive Fitness Battle. He bragged about it so much, his best friend really wanted one, so, I just ordered one for him because it's on sale! The sleep tracker, step tracker and mobile app all make it so user friendly. We are all now logging our water intake, food and calories and it has really helped with keeping us honest - not sharing our privatw numbers with each other, but keeping us honest with ourselves, and that's where the true fitness journey starts. I've lost 20 lbs since being more aware of my activity, food/drink/sleep. My son has been better about getting more rest and drinking more water. Highly encourage you to buy this!!",5
0,Heart rate sensor is completely broken. The numbers displayed on it are an insane fiction that bears zero resemblance to my actual heart rate. Tested it against my old Fitbit and an actual heart rate monitor. The old Fitbit and the monitor agreed fully and were always in sync. This thing displays absurd crap with no resemblance to my actual heart rate. Avoid this garbage,1
0,"Update: So it has been 3 weeks since i have sent in my watch and i still have not heard from FitBit that they received it or have sent my replacement. I contacted customer service and was told to call FedEx and have them find the package. It was sent off via USPS and they did a handoff to FedEx and provided no tracking number. So now im sitting in limbo waiting for the watch to get to FitBit so i can get a replacement. Absolutely unacceptable that i am told to go call FedEx with no tracking number and nobody can give me updates on when i will hear or get anything. I will NEVER buy a FitBit again after this. It is simply not worth the trouble to get it fixed because of a defect with the device. I recommend go with a name brand like Samsung or Apple. Do not recommend.This was my birthday present to myself. I ""upgraded"" from a Charge 3. This worked amazingly for the first 2 weeks. Then came the microphone problems. I have contacted FitBit about it and I was told to do a button factory reset, which then bricked the watch. It is now sent off and im waiting on a replacement because it was still under warranty. It has currently been put of my possession longer than I have have had it in my possession. If you want a fancy watch to do fancy things, consider an Ionic or another smart watch. If you just have to have Alexa on your wrist, buyer beware.",1
0,"I used to have the original Versa and I loved it! I never had an issue with it and it always synced with the app without any issues. I sadly had to say goodbye to it after the screen cracked after a very very bad fall while running. To make myself feel better, I treated myself to the Versa 2 and it has been nothing but a headache from day 1. It is so buggy! I have to fiddle with it almost daily as it struggles syncing with the app and sometimes it doesn't...and I just have to deal with it. It won't even say ""syncing issue, please try again."" It just syncs, but the numbers stay at 0 despite the watching showing my steps. It also just turns off randomly for some reason—even though it's not dead. It eventually turns on and I then have to re-connect it with the app. I'm at the point now where I only wear it during workouts to track my heart rate. I'm looking into a new fitness tracker and it definitely won't be a Fitbit...that's for sure. Such a bummer because the original Versa was PERFECT! I just don't have it in me to try the Versa 3....so maybe it's time to cave and buy the Apple Watch.",1
0,"I really like the sleep tracking, it’s 70% of the reason why I bought this. The only thing that bugs me is the step counter is WAY OFF. I keep my Fitbit on my non-dominate wrist. I brush my hair and the steps go up 400 in a matter of sections; I drive and the steps go up 1000. It’s very frustrating because it’s not even close to accurate*Update*I've had this for a little over a month now. The battery life is a joke. I have to charge it every couple of days. It used to last for a week. I charged it Saturday until it reached 100%; by sunday it was down to 86% battery life. Now, Monday I am at 36% and will likely have to charge it when I get home. Highly considering returning it because of the bad battery life.",2
1,"I just got my Fitbit Versa 2 in the Rose color with Petal band. Although I love the way it looks, I have found it very inaccurate in tracking my activity.Unless I am swinging my arm in an exaggerated manner, it does not recognize my steps. The whole time I was walking around in the store yesterday, it did not count my steps because my hand was pushing the shopping cart. Also, I live in a two-story home. I go up and down my stairs MANY times per day. The Versa 2 only registers a flight of stairs about 25% of the time. The sleep tracking is accurate some nights and not at all on other nights. It will say I went to bed at 4 a.m., when I actually went to bed around midnight (not sure what it thinks I was doing during my first 4 hours of sleep?)My previous Fitbit (Alta HR) was much more accurate, but I hated the magnetic band. It kept falling off and I was in constant danger of losing the tracker.So overall, I would say the Fitbit Versa 2 is a nice-looking watch, but that's about all.",3
0,"The Fitbit Versa 2 watch does not measure steps that one takes. It only measures arm movemens ie if you are sitting and moving your arm, Fitbit records it as steps you walked. So uness you think swinging your whiie sitting is the same as walking then you have the right gadget. But if you are like most folks who use the Fitbit to track your steps walked then you should NOT purchase this watch. IT is useless in tracking your exercise ( walking ). Waste of money! Better to buy an Omron pedometer , which I did and it tracks my steps much more accurately.",1
0,"Super disappointed with this Fitbit. It is my 4th Fitbit and for the first time since Fitbit came out, I’m really considering switching to Apple. This versa 2 has been nothing but issues. I’ve chatted and messaged several times now with support and I’ve done everything asked to make this watch work properly. However, it still glitches all the time. My notifications don’t come though, and it randomly disconnects all the time. The Alexa feature doesn’t work 98% of the time and this was my major factor for switching from the blaze to the versa 2. I contacted support once again and was told I would have to wait for updates! Well it’s been 5 months with this watch and I basically have a 150$ band that tells time. Ugh definitely switching to Apple now as my phone is Apple anyway.",2
0,I bought this in Dec. 2019 and loved it. Had all the features I was looking for and very nice looking. In July 2020 it suddenly stopped working. Would not turn on or charge - nothing. Called Fit-bit and was lucky they replaced it figured it was just a fluke. Then April/May of 2021 less than a year after replacement suddenly replacement watch is dead. Would try charging it and turned it on it would then flash on and off every few seconds until it would die again. Battery would drain in less then 2 hours and then take 2 days to charge just to start the process again. It had not been dropped or mistreated. The issues came out of nowhere. I called Fit-bit customer service and talked to multiple reps only to be told there was nothing they could do about it as it was out of warranty. (only a 1 year warranty on their products from original purchase date not replacement date) So basically paid a small fortune for something that lasted less then a year (technically less then a year as the first one died 7 months after purchase and then p months later 2nd is dead.),1
1,"I was always suspicious, not sure why I would spend this much money on a “smart” watch. What could it do, my phone doesn’t already do? This was a present and I started a new job. I am probably not using it to the full efficiency I could yet. But proud owner since Beginning January 2020 and within 3 weeks I lost 13.5 lbs, after plateauing out for 5 years now. So, in order for it to work for your benefit you have to be completely honest with yourself. Don’t skip logging the one bite of cake or cookie you had, or the toffee or snack size candy bar. It is for you and hat you log this and you can review. It’s notifications have often encouraged me to take the few extra steps to fulfill the goal of the hour.Alexa is still not developed fully and I use in this and a few apps consider either to be paid or more work between set up and watch that I have yet been willing to do. Disconnects quickly from house door to car door and seems to not work without the added home WiFi if I ask “Alexa to guard the house” etc.The pay function works better than phone (had to call my bank and set it up, it was easy and I feel more secure for it) Love changing my clock face and using personal photos , an extra added encouragement.You can pick up or hang up your phone, but not talk or play music for n the watch.Music requires a paid subscription or download on a pc (who even owns a pc anymore and honestly our laptops are so old, we use tablets and phones for our needs)Battery life is great and charges quickly.Remote Photo is a paid app.All in all - I think it is worth it, still a lot of kinks to be worked out. But this is a review from a first time Fitbit/smart watch owner and like I mentioned above, haven’t owned it too long yet. Probably more ways to use it to get out of it.",5
1,"I've owned a Moto 360, a Fitbit Charge 2, a Fossile Carlyle, and now, the Fitbit Versa 2.The Versa 2 is basically perfect. I had no idea. I'm not sure what everyone's complaining about; setup wasn't particularly bad (leave the Versa charging next to your phone, and keep it charging, too, then just let the firmware update; it takes a while). Battery life is everything they say it is, which--fresh from a Fossil Carlyle that lasted about 9/10 of a day--is so wonderful. 5 days with loads of features running. The software works; the native Music app, which I use constantly now that I figured out how to transfer music (a bit painful), streams beautifully and hiccup-free to my Bluetooth earbuds, which maintain as good a connection as with any device I own.Compared to Google Fit, Fitbit provides more meaningful data, at better granularity; it also tracks sleep natively, and does a substantially accurate job at it. It knows when I have bad nights; 3rd-party apps, I've discovered, do not.The OS and its app ecosystem handles almost everything I want it to, which I've discovered isn't much other than tracking my heart rate and exercise, streaming music, and--since I have multiple Amazon Echos, and multiple routines associated with them, and the whole smart home thing connected to it all--controlling things by talking into my wrist, which is kinda cool. Response time is admirable so far; the lights are dimming within less than a second of issuing the command. I was expecting loads of latency here.It's also a lovely little device, which I really didn't realize until watching some videos. Sure, it's totally derivative of the Apple Watch. And it is a bit heavy on the bezel side (you can basically obscure this fact by using dark watch faces, for the most part). But it's well-executed, and there are sufficiently many attractive watch faces that you can make a compelling piece out of it. I love it.I actually made up my mind to buy it the day after it was on sale for $120; I started debating about it the day before, but wasn't quick enough. So I paid a $60 premium on it, kind of, which is totally fine to me. It's worth it. Hope this thing lasts a few years. I'd like to keep it around.",5
1,"Overall the watch is nice.I enjoy the esthetics of it, and i've banged it a few times against the wall and other things without scratching the glass.I like being able to set alarms, and knowing when I received a text or phone call.Step counting isn't too bad, I'm guessing it's up to par with other watches, but if you're going for the active for x hours goal (250 steps per hour), the alert you need more steps is pretty light and i've missed it more times than I can count.My main issue with this watch is the heart rate monitor. if you're not resting, or stable for at least a minute it's very likely to be 30-40 bpm off, and more likely than not, twice or half as fast as your actual heart beat.If I start with a quick erobic excersize or run, my actual heart rate is around 130-150, and the watch shows i'm at 70.On other occasions i'm hiking slowly or lifting light weights, and the fitbit shows my heart rate at 130-150bpm when it's actually around 90.I stopped looking at the heart rate graphs because I simply don't trust it.",3
0,"At first I loved this Fitbit! It was easy to set up and had way more bells and whistles than my old Fitbit Blaze. After about 3 weeks of wearing it, things went wrong. It started turning itself on and off and would not charge or let me reset it. I contacted Fitbit and they provided a mailing label and detailed instructions to send it back to them, as it is covered under warranty (I would hope so after less than a month!). I hope they will just send me a new one! I am wearing my Blaze again and am out $179 until a solution is determined.",2
0,"The #1 reason - the only reason, really - I got this watch was to track my sleep patterns. I have had it for a couple weeks now and haven't gotten a decent reading yet. I've followed all of the instructions, I've got to the website and did all of the troubleshooting, I went on Youtube and followed all suggestions, and still couldn't get the silly (expensive) thing to work. Example: Last night, I know I slept about 7 hours, but when I check the watch this morning, it told me I only slept 42 minutes. Some nights it says I didn't sleep at all. So, since I don't need it for anything else, and it CAN NOT do the ONE THING I need it to do... I now have an expensive door stop. Anyone wanna buy it? I'll give you a good deal.",1
0,"I did lots of research before leaving my Apple Watch to get the FitBit Versa 2. Immediately, I missed the IOS integration and ability to control music and ping my phone. But the workouts seemed more accurate than my first gen Apple Watch, it was lighter on my wrist, and the BATTERY! Lasted up to 7 days.FOUR MONTHS after owning this product, I find (along with thousands of other customers if you google it), the touch screen doesn’t work anymore. FitBit support will give you the ring around and a million steps to do before eventually sending you a replacement. I’m imagining they haven’t changed how they make the Versa 2, so I’m going to expect it to inevitably fail again. You can’t get a refund after 45 days, even though the error is theirs and they can’t ensure a quality replacement.I’m literally furious to have spent this much money on a watch that’s SO BEHIND Apple it’s insane.If you’d like further issues:1) the screen is far behind its competitor and low quality graphic wise2) App logo design looks a decade old3) watch face choices are ugly and if you want better looking ones, get ready to pay for them4) the weather app doesn’t work well, I usually had to manually sync it to my phone to update, and since I already grabbed my phone- it’s faster to check there5) can’t control your music and I have NO IDEA why there’s a Spotify app when you can’t use it. And I’m a Premium Spotify userJust don’t waste your money on their “smart” watch.",1
1,"Great watch, still holds up in 2020 if you don't want all the bells and whistles.My main two issues which made me take a star off are:1. For a company focused on health, I wish they made sure the original wrist band was hypoallergenic, I've had it for less than a week and I'm scratching like crazy. Receiving a new band tomorrow, fingers crossed...2. Having to pay to get full access to sleep tracking, the devices are already expensive enoughOther than that, loving it!",4
0,"Upon receiving the item, the software is terrible, you have to wear the watch for 48 hours maybe longer if it can actually tell the time, before you can update it, and begin downloading apps and more clock faces. Until then you can’t, you can only do the basics. The app barely syncs and updates, no matter how good the wifi. The bands it comes with break easy I had to go out of my way to buy one, and it records incorrect stats. I like on the 3rd floor of my building, and work on the tenth floor of my job, and never records any flight of stairs I climb, worthless. The smart features are barely smart.",1
0,"Tl;dr - Dont waste your time on a faulty product with horrible customer service!!Going to be going on my 3rd try with the versa 2. First one, all the sensors went out within a few months. Called in, after some basic troubleshooting steps I had already done, they shipped out another one. Decent customer service.Then, with the replacement, the sensor that reads o2 for sleep went out (sleep tracking being my main reason for purchasing this). Called in to customer service and had a nightmare of a time trying to get the issue resolved. Despite having the tracker info from the app which clearly shows the o2 sensors lack of data, I was forced to repeat steps I had already taken to remedy (reboot and hard reset, which also is logged on the app and is visible to customer service), and was repeatedly told that the rep ""understands"" what I am describing to him, while telling me the sensor is working. I explained again how it definitely was not. Went back and forth for an hour before finally getting a shipping label emailed so they can check what is wrong with the device.The email with the shipping label stated I would recieve an additional email describing what I needed to include in the shipment. Nothing showed up. 2 weeks later I call in again and finally get the info on what to send back.When it worked, I loved the thing but overall..Dont waste your time on a faulty product with horrible customer service.",1
1,"Have been a Fitbit customer since 2013, maybe sooner. Owned a Charge, Charge 2, and now Versa 2. All are fairly competent recording my needs which are primarily step counting and sleep tracking. This past Christmas upgraded 3 Charge 2 devices to 3 Versa 2 devices. Wanted the additional features, “always on” clock face, and was hoping for better reliability with the App. When the App works, the device is decent at recording and displaying features. Only problem is, like the Charge and Charge 2, the Versa 2 runs on an unreliable App, especially when tracking sleep. Sometimes no sleep is recorded, sometimes the sleep recording stops after a couple of hours, sometimes the recording doesn’t provide details because it decided I wasn’t asleep for the minimum 3 hours of sleep when I actually slept 6 hours. Also, sometimes when open the App and the device is supposed to refresh and sync, I get a message that “No device found” while the device is on my wrist next to my computer that is trying to sync. Very frustrating. I have had countless emails with Fitbit support and they always, ALWAYS, provide the same instructions: Soft reset, hard reset, change sync to different mode, tighten device band on wrist, etc. They have a can of stock answers that they repeat over and over. From experience, I know these are not the issues. The App is unreliable. Still, for the money and because it links to Amazon Dot/Alexa, I continue to put up with the Versa 2, waiting for the day when I can get a reliable device with all the features I want at a decent price point. Go ahead and purchase a Fitbit device, but be aware, you will spend time emailing Fitbit Customer Support on occasion.",3
1,"Ok, after giving my family a hard time about their Fitbit use, tracking steps ect, get real.I needed a new watch and I liked the screen and with the stopwatch, calculator and calendar app it would do everything I need.Now after a week of use I am amazed how much this thing motivates me to take those extra steps, exercise regularly, eat a healthier diet. It’s even helping me get a better nights sleep.So I was wrong, they were right.This versa2 is really helping me make a difference on my health.Oh yeah, it’s a nice watch too.After 7 months half of my screen went out.I contacted Fitbit to get it repaired.After a 30 second hold a friendly technician came on and walked me through some steps to check it.He then said, yep, it’s broke, let me send you a new one. I was amazed, I expected to have to box it up and ship it to them.4 days later a new one arrived in the mail.What great customer service.",5
0,"I have been a Fitbit customer for a long time. I had issues with it connecting to my phone using Bluetooth so I had to connect with Wifi. Connection between my phone and Versa 2 keeps getting lost. So I had restart my phone to get it to connect again. Annoying. Text messages and notifications disappear even if you don;t reply and when you check on the notifications , it says all caught up. So far for the price and issues I am not very happy. Still debating if I will keep it or not... I want to like it but it is more of frustrating at this point than beneficial. Hope this helps and good luck.",2
1,"Negative first. Not exactly a 6+ day battery life. Even with very minimal app usage, I get about 4 days. Did a trial on their Snore monitor app, and it wiped out 25% just during a single night! I typically might lose 4-8% at night. It is a beta testing app, so I can’t judge it off that alone, but it gives you an idea of how different apps can affect the battery.I’ve also been having issues recently with it not responding to my touch for random periods of time. An alarm will go off, and I can’t click the arrow to stop it. I end up having to push the side button and snooze the alarm. Also, when trying to swipe in any direction to get to a menu, it won’t swipe. If I sync it with my app, it starts working again, but it’s becoming more frequent. I also wish Fitbit pay was comparable with more banks. Hopefully, in time. I also wish Fitbit came with Fitbit. Seems silly to have a Fitbit watch that also requires a Fitbit membership to do so many of the activities. Maybe if it was, like, $1.99/month or something. Alexa does a bit less than I hoped, but I also wasn’t aware of the fact that the watch didn’t have a speaker. Only a microphone. So, no sounds. Fitbit Music is Bluetooth with earbuds. For Spotify, you need ear buds still, and your phone needs to be with you. The watch simply allows you to control from your wrist. And, the text reply only works with messages within the Fitbit app, and only Android phones with texts.Other than these things, I love my watch. Starbucks pay is great. I do like that the alarms are discreet. I hate when I’m in a movie and forget to turn an alarm off. With my son’s meds, I have a few. My watch only vibrates. If I forget, it just vibrates during a movie. I also like the workout function. Works great with Weight Watchers Activity Tracking. I love the heart rate tracker, accurate calorie burn count, and water-proof capabilities, even though I haven’t used it in water yet. I’ve seen a few complaints about the lack of water-proof, but remember that water-proof does not mean no matter what. Read the water-care instructions thoroughly. My aunt does water aerobics weekly, and her watch is still fine.",4
0,"I just received the package sent and I am very disappointed. I contacted Amazon and they put me on contact with Fitbit who asked me to send it back. My Fitbit I purchased via Amazon was less than two months old when it died. I sent it back carefully with its original box and equipment. I waited over a month for it to arrive back to the company. They send it to me a week later and now I open a the box and have a Frankenstein Fitbit of bits and pieces of a refurbished one. Which I know is not my original one which I sent back, so I know mine was not looked at or fixed instead I was just sent some spare parts leftover from an open box or return.I paid full price for a brand new Fitbit that died less than six weeks later and adding insult I get this back.",1
0,"I had a Versa Lite that had served me well for three years but wasn't holding a charge very well. I upgraded to a Versa 2, thinking this would be at least as good as the Versa Lite. Wrong. Several features, such as the Active Minutes, weren't working on this watch. The app didn't always update correctly even though Bluetooth was enabled and other features worked. I was surprised, when looking for solutions on the internet, how many complaints there were. I tried several solutions but wasn't able to get the watch working correctly. Sadly, I returned it and went back to Old Reliable, the Versa Lite. I'm gonna baby the older model along because it seems to be one of the few Fitbit models with working features. When we're at the end of the line, I will look for a better brand.",2
0,"Do a google search for ""versa 2 turns off and won't turn on"" and you will find lists upon lists of posts in the Fitbit community blog with people that have similar issues with theirs and all you get for a response is the canned ""Thank you for joining the community"" and then a couple of silly suggestions. My favorite is that they tell you to restart the Fitbit which doesn't work because it isn't working so it's really difficult to restart it.I chose this watch over an Apple watch because I didn't feel the need to pay the premium for features I wouldn't use but obviously I'm the fool for paying more for a wristband than if I asked my 6 year old goddaughter to make me a friendship bracelet.",1
0,"I rather liked this little gadget, love that I can control my Alexa with it and I love the vibrate to wake up, so much more pleasant than an alarm.BUT, yesterday the screen randomly popped off. I have no idea why, it has never been struck or impacted, it just came loose. I looked at it and pressed it back into the bezel and it seems fine, but when I move my arm it popped right back off. I think since it was the wiring that held it on that with it popping loose repeatedly it just broke the connector. The screen still lights up, but I can't do anything with it. it still vibrates with new text messages and reminders to move but I can't see anything or dismiss an alarm.I got in contact with Fitbit and with absolutely no hassle they are sending me a replacement. I got it back in January so I am just within the year warranty.I still gave it 2 stars given the quality is suspect, but their customer service and ease of making a claim, I would rate them 5 stars.",2
1,"This is my 5th FitBit. I also have an Apple watch. The new Versa 2 is moving closer to an Apple watch, and looks more like one, but if you want the apps that Apple can run, don't buy the Versa 2. Having said that, I have always found the tracking ability of the FitBit products far superior to the iPhone watch, and FitBit is what I have on my wrist everyday.I was wearing a Blaze before I bought the Versa 2. I didn't expect to love the Blaze as much as I have. I would not have upgraded to the Versa without the allure of Alexa. Practically my whole house runs on Alexa! The lights, locks, thermostat, grocery list, all the fire sticks, security system, and now a clock. So when I saw that I can do that from my FitBit I was sold! And that is where the greatest disappointment lies. Alexa is not automatically voice controlled on your wrist. You have to swipe through three screens to get to it. Tap it and it is supposed to activate the voice control...except when I do that it mostly says it has lost it's connection. Also, if you are running IOS 13 FitBit sends you a notice that it is having an issue sending notifications to the new Versa 2. The Versa 2 often sends me messages that my Versa is not connected to my phone. :( I have NOT had these issues with any other FitBit device and my Blaze was running on IOS 13 just fine. So, what is the problem with the Versa? New technology, competition with Apple? Even if those are the reasons, FitBit is not a phone company and needs to have their products work with every brand of phone.I do like the ""feel"" on my wrist, it is not as large and ugly as the Blaze. You can buy some really cool clock faces (yeah, there are only a few free ones), but having said that I like the clock face options available and they are cheap. All the regular ways to track are there (although it looks like they finally did away with the stair climb tracking that NEVER worked the way it should).I hope functionality improves, if not FitBit may get it back. I have until January to return it.",3
1,"This is a big upgrade for me. I previously had the Fitbit Flex 1 and 2, then the Inspire. This is my first smartwatch Fitbit. I can understand how it would seem to not be a big upgrade for those who have had the Versa 1 before, but to me it is. The ""app store"" could use a big update, but other than that it does what it needs to do. It is very simple and it may not be the Apple Watch, but I really do not intend on using my Fitbit to do functions I can do on my phone. I really do not mind that I cannot respond to texts or answer calls (I have an iPhone). As long as I get notifications on it, which I do (getting my email notifications is really useful), then it does its job for me.Also, the health tracking is really cool. I love how it gives me a cardio score and sleep score. It is really beneficial because it makes me aware of my exercises and sleep. Overall, the Fitbit Versa 2 is a great watch. I would recommend it.",5
0,"I just returned this device today after appropriately two weeks of use. I really wanted to like this fitness tracker and the device itself does a good job at what it is advertised to do.; however, the Fitbit App (which the Versa 2 needs to interact with in order to function properly) drains my phone battery at a vastly accelerated rate (Note 8). I was getting two days phone battery life before having to charge my phone; after the Fitbit app I needed to charge twice a day. I looked on line and it seems this is a known issue but the Fitbit folks have not rolled out an update with a fix to their App yet. I tried the ""fixes"" listed online and at first it seemed to work..no bluetooth unless manually syncing plus some other features turned off which of course kind of defeats the convenience of having a tracker at all. The Fitbit Customer service rep didn't know about (or wasn't allowed to acknowledge the problem) and gave me no suitable answers or help.At this current time I can not recommend this Tracker until they get a fix to their App.The Device itself is nice looking but sits rather high on your wrist. It is comfortable enough to wear over night for monitoring sleep and it ""seems"" to be fairly accurate at estimating your sleep time and quality. Steps also seem to be fairly accurate but it will count anything you move your arm doing as a step (counted rocking in my recliner as steps - ha). Alexa worked as was advertised but it works in collaboration with the Alexa App on your phone so you need your phone within bluetooth range which I found I couldn't do because of the phone battery issue. The battery life of the Versa 2 itself is great. I did get a full 4 days. You may not have the issues with your phone that I did but I would check the comments on the Fitbit community review site to see what is said about the latest developments before purchasing.",2
1,"I have had this watch for a little over a week. Unfortunately, I had a very bad skin reaction to the band, hence I have to return it. Overall, I liked the watch. I liked the sleek design and nice features in it, like a period tracker. Another good thing was that it stayed connected to the watch all the time (the last watch I had was a much cheaper one and did not stay connected).Some things were not very good though. For example, it tracked steps when I wasn't walking. Or, it didn't correctly track my sleep. Another thing that made me nervous was that sometimes this watch wouldn't react to a hand movement or a tap to turn on the display, so I had to wiggle my hand around or reach for the button.",4
0,"It is no coincidence this thing is going to pot one month after the warranty is up. Or that there are already ""new and improved"" versions available. These are not designed to last. Screen flickering, turning green, battery only lasts a day. Factory reset didn't help, obviously a hardware problem (and a common one, based on the fitbit discussion boards). This will be the last fitbit I'll use, they're much too expensive to buy a new one each year or two. I'd rather get a cheap android smart watch then buy name brand again. This one was a gift from my husband for mother's day last year.",1
0,"When I purchased this I loved it. I bought it from Amazon last fall. Beginning the end of April, FitBit did a software upgrade. Now the watch drains a 100% charge in 3 hours. The only way to keep the battery from draining so quickly is to tiurn off Bluetooth to your phone. This is not what I signed up for. FitBit is ignoring the large volume of pleas for help on this. How great of them to make an expensive fitness watch useless for tracking. It is very inconvenient to turn on Bluetooth every time I want a sync or to log food. BUY SOMETHING ELSE. FitBit does not seem to care about function once they have your money. Very bitter about their attitude.",1
1,"Nice, but lacking. It tracks sleep, steps, and time very well. I receive text notifications, and after a lengthy process and much googling I was able to get Pandora to work. And then my battery died so quickly I uninstalled Pandora as the features of the tracker are useless when it's dead.I expected to be able to do several things on a new smart watch. This is not a smart watch. This is a feature rich activity tracker. I don't feel the price equals the value though I am excited to see where Google takes the next tracker. The band is wide and ugly. I replaced that immediately (at an additional cost of course). The charger is unique, of course, and because I never know when the battery will die I had to purchase a second charger after leaving the first at work on a Friday. Yet another additional cost. The chargers don't come with charging boxes, and, beware, don't use your rapid phone charger. I don't have a PC, so charging at work is ideal. At home I discovered our cable box has a USB port. Hopefully it is a low enough charge not to fry the thing. Would I buy it again? Absolutely. Would I pay over $100 again? Not until I can use my Google Assistant, get directions, and receive voice feedback (all Alexa answers are on the screen as the Versa 2 doesn't have a speaker).If you are looking for a smart watch, keep looking. If you are looking for an activity tracker, look for a sale and plan on buying accessories.",3
0,"Unfortunately if I could give this watch zero stars I would. I purchased this watch on February 7, 2020 and the battery will no longer charge less than a year later. From the beginning it seemed the charge on this watch wouldn’t last long. It went from perhaps 3 days max when I first got it between charges and digressed to two days and by summer 2020 I was charging it every night which means no sleep tracking. Now, I leave it on a charger for days and nothing. No Fitbit dot emoji....nothing. I even bought another charger in hopes it was the charger that was bad. For the price I would expect it to last longer than 11 months. I would encourage people who are looking for this type of watch to consider another company......other brands may be more expensive but by the time I replace this one it would have saved me in the long run.",1
1,"I have just one minor quibble with this device, and I would give it 4.5 stars if I could.Pros:Easy to use - the user interface is very easy to navigate and and it's intuitive. Setting alarms is easy and doesnt require the appCustomizable faces - I'm able to select from a slew of faces for free, most are questionable but there are some real gems out there that display all my fitness tracking info on the home screenBattery - lasts several days and recharges relatively quickly, mine usually lasts me about 4-5 days without charging.All of the standard fitbit features you expect, and more. Anyone familiar with fitbit will know what I mean.The Con:The band - I kind of hate it. It's got alot more grip than my previous fitbit bands. I used to just rinse the band off and maybe use some soap and water to clean it every so often after a serious workout. That's not an option here, it caused some kind of red mark on my skin after about a week. I started washing it with soap and water regularly, come to find this material can retain some of the harsh chemicals so that didnt work out well. Somewhere I read to use cetafil so I now use Cetafil and water after every workout (5 days a week). Its mostly fine but after my two break days I notice some minor redness. taking the band off is easy, putting it on is an incredible pain.I know that's the most detailed part of my review but I felt I needed details to explain what I feel is ultimately an incredibly minor quibble. It's an amazing device and I am truly very happy with it. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a fitness tracker with basic smartwatch functionality. Especially over much of the competition with limited battery life and a large amount of seemingly useless or niche features.",4
0,"Purchased 7 months ago and now the screen won’t turn on.I was very dedicated to wearing it daily and took good care of it. I was happy to have a way to track my progress. I liked that I could see a brief look at what email, texts and calls I was getting as I am a life coach. It doesn’t respond though as I thought it did so keep that in mind. Also it doesn’t track sleep well if you are laying down calmly like I do most nights.Very disappointed that I chose this over the Apple Watch.",2
0,"I had a Ftibit Versa 2 for about 1-yr when the device lost all accuracy for tracking my flights. I would wake up with 30-50 flights and have at least 100 by the end of the day. Fitbit sent me a replacement Versa 2 because of this error. I had the replacement for less than a month and went swimming. The new Versa 2 was destroyed by the 5-ft pool depth even though it is water resistance to 50 meters. I contacted Fitbit help, but they told me they had already given me a replacement so I was out of luck. I had two Versa 2's and both had significant defects. I had a Fitbit Blaze prior to my last Versa 2 and I liked it, but this recent experience may force me to look at alternative manufacturer in the future.",1
0,"I got this for two main reasons, wanted a heart rate monitor for when i was doing my running workouts and to track my sleep.The biggest problem i have with the heart rate monitor is the delay - which if you're actively monitoring heart rate for sprints etc makes this a very poor tool. Even when I'm doing long distance runs the monitor doesn't always catch my heart rate (maybe because of the sweat?) which is incredibly annoying.The battery life is awesome it lasts about 4-5 days before i have to charge it if you're not playing with the watch. One day my battery just took a crap on me and a full charge would last about 16 hours to go from 100 to 0, no idea what happened to it I've been very careful with my watch.In retrospect i should have gotten a chest strap and skipped out on the sleep analysis which you don't get in full detail unless you pay a subscription fee.Tldnr: didn't like heart rate monitor, battery lasted less than a year.",2
1,"It was really easy to set up. I primarily bought this for the sleep tracking and step counting. It's big for a woman's wrist but.... just about all of the smart watches & fitness watches are. I easily get 3-4 days battery life and only need a little over an hour to get a full charge. It is a bit disappointing how many features require a subscription.I am still not sure what to use the Alexa feature for.I like that I not only get text & phone call alerts but I can also see the alerts from my security system.Once I figure out how to use it, I think I will really like that I don't need my phone to use bluetooth headphones to listen to music while I walk.",5
1,"I'm posting a review here even though I purchased my Versa 2 directly from Fitbit on a black Friday sale (Amazon was out of stock on the color I wanted).Overall, I'm very pleased having upgraded from a Charge 2. At the Black Friday price of 129 I would buy it again. HOWEVER, there are issues future owners should know about. The big one is connectivity. Once you review all settings and make sure GPS is always on for Fitbit, connectivity improves though it's still problematic. The ""connected"" GPS is basically non-functional, so get the Versa 3 or Charge 4 with onboard GPS if that's important to you.The features I use most are steps, sleep tracking, timers/alarms, weather, and Alexa. All work well except the last two which are spotty due to connectivity problems. If you're NOT using features that require a solid bluetooth connection you will be pleased with this watch, otherwise, I suggest considering another option.",4
1,"Style: seems large at first but I think it’s perfect now!Color: I ordered coal/copper and it’s true to colorBattery: my battery lasts 4 days EASILY on one charge!App: hands down the best fitness app, regardless of watch, I’ve ever used! And an awesome community to keep you motivated if you choose to join one (free!!)No hidden fees! Straight up paying for the watch and amazing app all in oneFitbit vs Apple: (this review is as a huge Apple fan too)Style: for the watch face fitbit has endless options. Seriously endless, and very customizable. Apple has fewer and messier options. In fact I had to search for and download an extra app just to display a pedometer on my Apple series 3.The bands are the same as far as options go.The actual watch is so similar as far as physical size and design, however fitbit has one button and Apple has 3/4. More complicated.App: there’s really bare bones for the Apple app. No community, fewer calorie tracking options, again, fitbit beats all fitness apps to me.Battery: fitbit lasts 4 days (probably more if you use less apps). Apple only ever lasted me a day and not even a full day.Hope this helps!!",5
0,"Where do i start? After a few months my Versa 2 would not allow me to use my Alexa app. After several restarts, contacting Fitbit I pretty much stopped used the Alexa app feature such as adding to shopping list and reminders which is one of the reasons i purchased the fitbit. The second problem was when exercising and using that feature ie. walks, I could not exit after pausing the app. Very frustating. After several attempts I pretty much gave up. I will never again purchase a fitbit device. They are worthless. I had to put in a claim using my extended warranty and waiting on that outcome but to add insult to the injury I have to pay an additional $25.00 with the hopes they replace my fitbit with a new one. Never again. Never",1
0,"I purchased my Fitbit Versa 2 almost a year ago and loved it when i first got it. I workout regularly and being able to talk workouts with calories burned and heart rates. The sleep tracking is awesome too! Plus the downloadable clock faces and a number of other features make this an awesome little device.Now to the big issue I've encountered. About a month ago Alexa and voice text replies stopped working. I tried every troubleshooting technique available including logging out and back into Alexa, updating/uninstalling and reinstalling the app, checking the language setting, doing a factory reset on the device, none of which worked.I have been in contact with support 3 times. Each time they have me do the same procedures which have never worked the last 10 times I've tried it. They then tell me that they will have to escalate it to their ""higher support"" and i will receive an email. After 13 days i never received an email and now i am approaching my 1 year since purchase. I can't help but think that they are just giving me the run around until my manufacturer warranty is expired to tell me that the device isn't covered!Really unhappy with the support from Fitbit! Should have just saved up and went to all apple products!!!",2
0,Put it on my left arm and about an hour into wearing it I started having intense pain in my hand and arm. Switched to my right arm and again after about an hour same thing. Apparently after looking online this is a thing with their product… feels very unsafe to me. I bought it cause I’m having heart issues and wanted to be able to monitor it easier. I am Returning.,1
1,"I have had the watch for almost a month. I track steps, spinning for my stationary bike, heart rate, weight loss, monitor sleep and food/water intake. It makes it easy for counting calories. I have been unable to load music on the watch because I have not been able to successfully install the app on my computer. Not a big deal yet. I also have not been able to control music on my phone from the watch while using bluetooth headphones. I can without the headphones but, who does that? I suppose if you are using something wired. My headphones control the music anyway so that's not a big deal either. I am looking forward to spring and summer for outdoor activities. The biggest negative for me is the charger that comes with it is kind of lame. The wire is directed straight away from the back of the charger. It's awkward and I noticed others felt the same way. I guess it would work with some sort of stand that accommodated the wire. I actually just ordered a separate charging stand. For those of you who just bought the watch and have a lot of other devices you charge at night, I recommend getting a complete charging station but make sure it works with that watch. Also I have a Samsung s7 edge that works with my watch but make sure your phone works with yours. Older phones may not. One more thing. I have not submerged the watch. I have seen some reviews that claim the watch stopped working after swimming with it. I bought a leather band for it so I don't get it wet. I downloaded the manual before I bought the watch. Be patient while learning. Google helped.",4
1,"The media could not be loaded.
 Love the ease of use of the watch and app. Haven't had any issues with accuracy, fingers crossed I never will.The one issue I did have however was with the included band. It caused irritation on both wrists. I tried cleaning the band after it broke out my right wrist before switching to my left but it didn't work and broke out the left as well. Had to order a new band of different material (see picture) and have been fine ever since.So if you have sensitive skin I guess, I'd recommend purchasing another band as a backup when you purchase so you won't have to wait after already receiving.",4
0,"This watch is a hunk of junk. I'll be exercising and my heartrate will be at a steady pace and the watch will display a 30 point drop or rise in heartrate without changing my pace. I have a pulse oximeter so I checked my heartrate as I was exercising and it gives a totally different reading than the watch. I do have an arrhythmia which is why I bought the watch in the first place. When the watch says my heartrate zoomed from a steady 135 bpm to 178 bpm and holds that rate for several minutes, while I'm standing still, you know something is off. This is a piece of junk. Don't waste your money. I'm going with an Apple watch. You get what you pay for.",1
0,"Literally the most stressfull set up and daily user. After 1 day of use I pretty much gave up on the device. From the beginning it would not connect to wifi. Once I got the update done which took about 40 minutes I had the tracker sometimes show me my notifications, emphasis on sometimes. Thought it was a fluke, went to sleep and guess what ? Connection was lost between tracker and app so incorrect data there. Desided to start over. Factory reset the watch, deleted the app and ready to start again. Set up was faster which was good. Then i go to test Alexa out..... No connection. Restart my phone and it worked. So then i go to try out Spotify and ...... Not connected to Bluetooth. Which is weird because i was receiving notifications. So basically i have an expensive apple watch looking knockoff because none of the functionalities actually work as expected",1
0,Purchased brand new to replace my versa lite which stopped working (black screen stopped charging) only to get a Versa 2 that wouldn't charge or turn on. I am so done with Fitbit products. Their customer service is garbage and so are their trackers. Getting my refund and paying for a better quality device that won't die in 2 years.,1
1,"I love this watch and it is worth the investment! Prior to switching over to this watch, I used the Garmin vivofit watches since they were waterproof and you did not have to charge them. Unfortunately their watches have not improved and the newer one I bought within the last year died a lot sooner than prior watches had. To me, it tracks the sleeping and steps a lot more accurately than the Garmin watches.I saw in some reviews how people said their Versa shorted out on them in the shower, but I have worn mine in the shower/gone swimming and it has not shorted out at all.Battery life is awesome! Lasts 6-7 days for me. I never thought I would want to have a tracker watch where I had to charge it, but it does not take long at all to charge.The only con for me is that since I have an iPhone, I am unable to talk-to-text back, but I love that I can at least see my text messages and phone calls when they come in. I will definitely be switching back to an android phone once my iPhone has been paid off so I can utilize the other features of the watch.",5
1,This is my first such watch and it functions fairly well. Setup was easy and straightforward and the mobile app is good. It does take some time syncing in the morning but on the whole is good. Step tracking is exaggerated. It tracks steps even when I am in the car driving and when I use the hand to brush my hair so I think the step stats are a little optimistic. Pulse rate tracking is fairly good but sometimes it is as if it gets stuck at a figure for a minute or two. This tracking though is good enough for daily use. The puls tracker responds well to exercise. Sleep tracking reporting on the app is commendable though if you wake in the morning and lie for a while in bed this will get reported as light sleep. I can only seem to get fair scores but it is more me than the watch. On the whole sleep tracking and reporting is great. Battery life is 4 days max not 5 and will vary if you look at it a lot or if you change the face to one of those that does continuous heart monitering for example.It charges quickly and easily though. The watch is comfortable and the bands are easy to change once you get the knack of it. It needs now to turn on the Oxygen sat moniter for sleep apnoea. Thea Alexa partof the watch is only fair. I have still to test some aspects of the watch but on the whole I have been very satisfied. I was just a little upset that just whe I bought it the price dropped. Happy with it would buy again.

0,We bought one of these for my mother-in-law who loved it and took good care of it but the face fell off and was dangling by the connecting ribbon. She had it for just under two years. In searching the web this happens to a lot of people. The watch is pretty good and probably worth more than one star but I wanted to offer the warning because of the know issue that isn't being addressed... It's a consumable...,1
1,"I love everything about this watch. It tracks your sleep patterns and breaks it down into deep sleep, REM sleep, and light sleep. It even tells how many minutes of tossing and turning you had and if you stay up late it track it all. The mobile app is very easy and there are so many different things you can do on it. The battery life lasts about 4 plus days depending on what you are doing with it. I love the relax feature where I has breathing techniques foe you too do and it tracks your street throughout the day and it's all recorded. There are clock faces that you can change out that recorded different things,, I would definitely purchase this watch again.",5
1,"This works fine as a smartwatch, but don't get it for the audio features or you might be very disappointed. I bought it for my daughter because it can play music, but you have to have a Bluetooth headset. Unfortunately, not all bluetooth headphones work. We've tried two sets that pair well with my Apple iPhone 8, and they work great. When paired with the Versa 2, the music is crackly and it sounds like chipmunks singing. We've just ordered a 4.0 set of Bluetooth earphones to see if they work any better. I'm not holding out hope. And it doesn't seem that Fitbit cares or is working on a fix as from chatrooms, it is clear that this has been going on for some time. They also don't have a list of compatible headphones, so it comes down to trial and error, which can be expensive. Wish I had known this before buying this watch.Update: The audio watch works with the following Bluetooth headphones: SoundBot¨ SB221 HD Wireless Bluetooth 4.0 Headset Sports-Active Headphone for 20Hrs Music Streaming & 25Hrs HandsFree Calling w/ Sweat Resistant Ergo",3
0,Why would you ship a fitness smart watch like this with the small wristband already on it. Oh that's because Fitbit is Stupid!!! Why would you make it nearly impossible to get the small band off though after struggling for 30 minutes I finally got it off. I had to watch the video on their website to get the small wristband off. Then why would you make it impossible in this universe to get the large wristband onto this watch. After struggling for 45 minutes to trying to put the large wristband on. I was unable to get the large wristband on this watch. I knew and saw on the video how the wristband works and I was able to pull the pin down but the wristband simply would not insert into the watch. It looks like a beautiful smartwatch fitness tracker but I'm sending it back with out having ever used it. What a shame to design such a nice smart watch and then design a wristband that can not be put on the this Versa 2 by any known means in this universe. I used a credit card to hold the pin down while trying to insert the large band. I used a paperclip to hold down the pin while trying to insert the large band. The pin on this wristband caused my fingers so much pain I had to use objects to try to hold the pin in the wristband down while also trying to insert the wristband into the Versa 2. After an hour and a half messing with this band I gave up. I will gladly send this back with out having ever used it. This Fitbit Versa 2 is a piece of junk.,1
0,"I've had 5 Fitbit's now and this is my last. I bought this Versa 2 in December 2019 and it failed this week. I don't torture my Versa 2. Wear it for sleep mostly and to control my Spotify. Which BTW ... the FItbit Spotify integration has been awful since upgrading about 6 months ago. Also, the Fitbit app constantly annoys you to upgrade to Premium. Never had that in the beginning and now it's a daily nuisance. This product has gone downhill and I'm moving to Amazon's new smart watches.",1
0,"Bought this device mainly for the personal music storage to use when I work out. Pretty poor design overall.1) There's no way to just connect your fitbit directly to your laptop via USB and transfer music. You have to connect your fitbit to the WiFi and download the app on your computer to transfer music. The WiFi on my fitbit died after 1 year which pretty much rendered the device useless to me.2) You cannot switch playlists while it's tracking your workout. You can only switch between songs in your current playlist. If you want to switch playlists you have to stop your workout tracking, switch playlists and then start another workout sessionConsidering music storage was one of the big draws of the Versa vs. the Charge I would recommend saving your money and just getting a Charge instead. Or get a different brand.",2
1,"So many things to like about the Versa 2, however it really falls short in the way of the app. For example 1), you can see your HR graphed out. You can hoover over the graph and see the HR and time. You cannot however see a ""list"" of the data points they use to create the graph. They have the data and it would be easy to write code to show us a graph. Yet not today but hopefully in some future release - its an easy and common for developers to code lists for graphed data, 2) The Versa 2 does (no Fitbit watch) not show HR during time of sleep. I have $50 tracker, not as nice in many ways as the Versa 2, yet it has the features these 2 features.After the FitBit comment, I am ungrading to a 4 - I'll check out the Premium. However, $10 a month is way too much to see HR during sleep - the other Premium services I personally have little use for.",4
1,"My new review: i figured that for syncingto work properly i need to keep bluetooth on (on my phone and also fitbit, though it does not show connected, so may be not needed), and when it does not sync, i simply need to restart my fitbit. Still about 5 to 10% of the time it gives syncing issue, for which I need to restart it.Other than that, it's great, works perfectly. Some scope of improvement:- one night it didn't tracked details of my sleep (like nrem, rem etc), coz i was wearing it very loose. I would want my watch to show this: that details of sleep won't be tracked, probably coz you are wearing it too loose.- there is no alarm which says wake after certain number of hours have been slept. Again this will require it syncing to the server (as amount of time i was asleep (minus wake time in between) is calculated at the server), but still could be a good feature, like wake me up by 9:00 am but if i have slept for 6 hours, may be wake me up at 7:34 (If that is when 6 hours gets completed) I know, i know most people don't have luxury to wake up in such wide range.- some times when i try to remove the watch, it becomes tight. I pull the strap to unlock it, and it gets locked to a closer hole. May be its me, but i guess design of strap could be improved.My previous review: This device is great, but sometime it raises my blood pressure and frustration coz it just wont sync. And that is why I am giving it a 1 star.Is there a practical way to resolve this? Can fitbit give me a simple USB cable which I could connect to my PC/mobile and sync it?I like this, coz it's water proof and it also measure my heart rate. But if syncing can't be resolved than unfortunately I have to return it.",5
1,"Update: Okay, took a little more effort than previous Fitbits but it is a whole new deal. It's an upgrade after all. Eventually got it to sync with Chronometer. Getting used to using it and enjoying it. Love the sleep stages analysis. And yeah, it's pretty. My Surge looks really clunky and primitive in comparison. Enjoying Alexa now and again on walks to check the temps and the time of sunset, though so far it's usefulness is limited and with my phone with me why not ask Google. I still have a lot of features to arm!The new charging docking station is great! It wasn't always easy with the older models, trying to plug it in.I settled on a classic watch face with a second hand. It's beautiful.Immediate, first hours, knee-jerk response:It's unfortunate when you invest in an upgrade and it takes you a step back! I used my Fitbit Surge with the Chronometer app. A winning combination, I lost 56lbs in 8 months. ""Upgraded"" to Versa 2, only to find that it's not compatible with Chronometer! What a drag!Also, I made the mistake of installing a new face. Turns out it's 3rd party and after a few minutes I was asked to go to the apps website to enter a code to keep using it. I've had Fitbit for years and this is the first time I got so frustrated that I had to call tech support😡! To Fitbit's favor, at least I was connected to a helpful, knowledgeable, yet unsympathetic, young man.",5
0,The latest firmware (72.1.9) that was just rolled out the end of last week broke the HR functionality. My watch does not track heart rate which impacts almost every aspect of the watch/app functionality. Basically leaving me with a broken useless device.

I contacted support and best they can do for me is to give me a 35% discount on purchasing a new Fitbit! Fortunately, I had bought the Asurian warranty and am able to get a replacement. As for the watch itself, It is very limited in functionality. I can barely use the features it does offer, because I don't want to subscribe to these services! and I don't have a choice, so for example, I ignore that I even have Music as an option on there! I don't recommend this watch!",1

I called fitbit read how description says 24/7 heart rate agree about discription not saying but nothing help me. He thought was 40 sonething. Not reliseing that it was double that due to add coating... I read so much after.. But unsure what other company to go to . if coment on their fb. They will act like they want help you when you warm other. Well. Then. You message them your email. Oh i see you already talked to someone.

0,"I really wanted to love it but I hate it. I researched and was debating between the Versa2 and Samsung's Active 2 watch. I wish I would have went with Samsung. If you only really want to use this for step count, workouts and sleep tracking it might be fine for you. I however use it for everything and heavy on the notification functionality. I loved having the capability to use Alexa to reply to texts and set reminders, etc. However, the watch loses connection a lot or the notifications just stop completely. I have to manually sync it and/or turn it off/on a lot to get them to work again. Same thing for Alexa...half the time I get an error message due to connectivity and can't use it when I need it. And I keep my phone in close range all the time. Super annoying. Additionally, ring alert notifications don't work on fitbit anymore (apparently they did until the big update in Oct, which is when I bought it). Lots of people complained in a thread on their support forum and they asked us all for all the specifics of our app versions, etc and said they were looking into it for a month or two and then radio silence. I sadly missed my return window waiting for them to ""fix"" the issue, which we did discover is a Fitbit issue. Also, be wary if you have an iPhone bc I see a lot of notifications on their website about known issues...doesn't seem like they are fixing anything.",2
1,"I got this Fitbit about a year ago and was super excited for a beautiful form factor and smart watch that worked with my Android (unlike all my friends, I don't use iPhone so couldn't do apple watch). It's really a nice looking watch, and I like that you can change the face, etc. BUT, there were two major problems from the get-go that I'm still having, and since Fitbit support can't help, I'm considering ditching this altogether.Problem 1: SEVERE overcounting of steps. Example: I went on a 5 mile walk with my friend one morning. Her Apple Watch logged ~12K steps, which seems about right. My Fitbit logged over 20K steps, which is almost certainly wrong. Yesterday I took a bumpy car ride and earned myself 6K steps. It logs steps ALL the time - when I move my arms, when I'm in the car, when I clap, etc. When I spoke to support, they suggested wearing it on my other wrist (didn't help), made sure I told the app it was on my dominant wrist (it was), and told me to try re-setting it (I did several times). They have a frankly ridiculous override, which is to go into the app and ""delete"" steps by telling the Fitbit you were doing some non-step activity, like driving, for the entire time you got the oversteps (by the way, you can't actually delete steps - you have to use this stupid and effortful workaround). Well, I don't know how that's supposed to work if it's just overcounting steps on a walk, and it overcounts steps all day, so I wouldn't even know how many steps to try and override, or how long a car ride to enter to get rid of the right number of steps. Frankly, for a device that started as a step counter, I'm super disappointed it's that bad at it. As someone who's really trying to increase activity and track my steps, I find this to be completely useless.2) Rashes. Many times, I've gotten rashes, with both the original strap (which caused the rashes in these photos - one on left wrist and one on right) and a third party band. I am careful to put this on dry skin (like I don't wear it in the shower or pool or anything), but I live in Arizona and it's almost summer and my wrist sweats under the band, so I don't know what to do about it. When I wear the band looser, it just travels up my arm and sticks there. I'm definitely open to suggestions on the band.Overall, though I love the way it looks, I'm super disappointed in how it performs the most basic of functions, and obviously I can't even wear it in the summer. BUMMED. Wish there were better alternatives.",3
0,Didn’t work right out of the box. I kept thinking it was user error so I didn’t return it. All of these issues experienced by a friend and multiple other people online. Always on display worked at first. Then not at all. Doesn’t track my sleep anymore. GPS won’t sync. One night an alarm started going off every 15 min. Started at 10pm ish. So you can imagine. Had to take it off for the night. None of the preset alarms ever work. Too many issues to list. Yes. There are solutions online. Customer service does try to be helpful. Conversation boards were better. Some issues happened Again and again. No matter what. Ordered it in Jan. Now it does still tell time. Sometimes tracks my steps. Oh. The weather app is usually way wrong. Did like my last 2 Fitbits ok. Now I’m buying an Apple Watch.,1
0,"My Versa 2 is less than 2 years old and I've really babied it that whole time and avoided any rough conditions or damage to it. It practically looks like new.Two weeks ago the touchscreen started glitching out, randomly triggering touches all over the screen. I followed all the troubleshooting I could find online including doing a factory restart on the device, but the only part of the screen that responded to touch anymore was the very middle.Then, it started restarting itself over and over and at one point got so hot to the touch that I was afraid it was going to start on fire.Now it won't charge or turn on at all.Their online support was painful to deal with, and in the end they offered me a 35% discount on a new device instead of any option to refurbish or fix the device I already bought. (I guess Fitbit as a company is a huge fan of generating e-waste rather than trying to repair anything.) Too bad they didn't offer me a 35% discount on a competitor's watch because I'm definitely not buying junk from this company again!",1
0,"I was all set to love this watch, but it has had a multitude of issues since getting it. Issues ranging from syncing, to sporadic and inconsistent heart rate monitoring, inconsistent sleep monitoring, screen touch and lighting issues, etc. I’ve spoken to other versa 2 owners who don’t have any of the same problems. I contacted customer service today and they basically had me reset the watch (which I’d already done), and then told me to watch it and see if it continues having issues. The return window for this watch is very short, I should have sent it back right away. My mistake.",1
0,"I have a $30.00 watch that does a better job than this one does. I bought this specifically to track my heart rate and exercise. The heart rate tracker would jump all over the place when I made the slightest movement. It tracked me playing the guitar as an ""outdoor bike ride"" with a HR of 187! Not useful as I need to be able to accurately track my heart rate (which is fine BTW). They also always push selling the premium app to get any additional information. I told my doctor about this and he suggested I stop using the watch, which I did. I'm back to the $30.00 watch that works fine. I would have returned it, but I missed the window by a week. Maybe I got a lemon. Who knows. I can't recommend it though.",1
0,"Update: I hate this thing more each day. The HR monitor is a complete joke.I really want to love this device; and, there are days that I do. Those are the days when I can tell the HR monitor is fairly accurate. But, there are too many times it shows me sleeping during times when I am awake but just laying there watching TV. And, there are days that I just can't seem to get the HR monitor to track during exercising. I know that wrist monitors are not the best, but some days this thing just won't do it. I put it on the same way each day and 90% of the time it tracks it. The rest of the time, it's all I can do to get it to work.This device also likes to disconnect from the app fairly frequently. And, this usually happens when you really need to rely on notification coming from it.When it works properly, though, it is everything I was hoping for when I purchased it.",1
0,"Absolutely do not buy this watch if you have an iPhone. Many of the features do not work with iPhone and pairing it with anything has to be done every single day, including just to be notified that you’re getting text or phone calls. If you want a nice band that is not sold by Fitbit, many times they come out easily making your watch go flying. To charge the watch, I have to clean out the little holes on the back every time with a pin before it will actually charge. This is because skin cells, dirt, etc. get into the holes and don’t allow it to charge. This Fitbit advertised itself as a competitor to an Apple Watch. Not even close. I will definitely shell out for the Apple Watch next time.",1
0,"this was my second fitbit purchase after my original versa broke. before it broke, i did enjoy using it so i opted for the versa 2. with the original versa, i would take it in the water, etc. because there was a feature for swim tracking so i thought it was waterproof. but it stopped working when i was in the water - so versa 2 i was extra careful to not let it anywhere near water.now it hasn't even been a full 6 months since purchase and it has stopped working. i was charging it during my shower and after i came out of the shower and checked, all my data for the day was gone when in the morning, it was working fine. so i proceeded to restart the versa hoping that would help. but instead, the screen would never turn back on. i called fitbit customer service and they told me to do stuff like wipe the versa, wipe the charger, restart (mind you i did all these things before i called) and it just seemed like a waste of time. honestly, this is kind of ridiculous for a watch i paid $150 for. i'm thinking of switching to apple watch instead since this is the second time this has happened. realize i could've just gotten a nice, functioning apple watch for the price of 2 fitbit versas that broke lol.",1
1,"Like a lot of people, I gained weight over COVID. I didn't actually start to gain weight until I started fulltime virtually teaching last school year. As I was sitting so much, and stress eating, I gained about 20 lbs. I bought the FitBit to track my steps and help with my accountability. Since then I've also added using the Food Tracker to further help me with my accountability. The only issue I have is that if I start the Workout and Map My Walk at the same time, the distance measured between the 2 is pretty different, and that difference becomes more pronounced over longer distances. Other than that quirk, I love my FitBit! It has helped me slim down the 20 lbs I gained last school year and I am hoping to slim down even more.",4
0,"Very upset with this Christmas gift for daughter. Not opened until Christmas 2020, this Versa 2 is now dead. FitBit does NOT sell battery replacements for this version and see no OEM online. BLOGS indicate this is a common and known problem. Feel ripped-off and pissed. AMAZON SUPPORT SUCKED. Amazon claimed that the one month return date had expired and it did. One month for an item advertised with a long-term battery. Did Amazon suspect they would have many problems with this item? I think YES.",1
1,"I got this because I work in a lab and I wanted Alexa on my wrist so I can set timers, or change songs on spotify without taking off my gloves. I am a huge alexa fan so I went with fitbit. I was very disappointed because there is no option to have alexa always listening for her wake word, you have to manually press the button on the side or swipe to alexa on the screen. For me, this defeats the purpose of having alexa on my wrist. She also only answers in text, not through audio, would be nice to have the option for audio. Also, I tried to set up fitbit pay but none of my 4 credit cards work with fitbit, thy only work with a number of specific banks.",3
0,"It constantly disconnects from my phone. This is a pain when I want to use the find phone function on my watch when I'm looking for my phone. Updating the Fitbit can be such a struggle that it takes days to do. The Fitbit app is a mess and it's super frustrating how it will forget that I've logged into my Spotify account and I'll have to press the button to log in again even though it still has all of my info saved and I'm never buying a Fitbit again.The best part of this watch is that it's a fitness tracker first and foremost. It does that part really well, tracking steps, heart rate, sleep, and so much more and it puts that info into really understandable terms for you. I just don't want have the patience for it anymore.",1
0,"My second purchase of this product - the first one lasted a while until I started training in the pool. I had it about a year and a half prior to its dying. It died after about a month of pool usage (lap swimming and water aerobics). I thought maybe it was just time for it to die - and I ordered a new one.I didn't take it in the water (not showering or swimming) for 9 months or so. I thought I should try it again, and what do you know - it died. Not even a year old.Despite it's advertisement as a watch compatible with tracking swimming it is not waterproof - I would say it's not even water resistant - and you should not use this product if you are doing any part of your training in the water.Looking at Garmin for a waterproof option.",2
0,"So this is my second Fitbit watch since 2016 the first one I had was the Blade this was very early in the watch technology game an it worked well for its time also lasted 2 solid years until I destroyed it at work one day so I decided to upgrade to this Versa 2 back in September of 2018 so the first year I was highly impressed with the updates an the usability of the watch then right around September of 2019 almost a year to the date of buying it and with little to no damage done thus far strange things started happening - battery charges take forever and drain fast one week then charges in a flash an will last for almost 2 weeks not a big deal but strange to me - other times it would recognize text messages an phone calls for a few days then all of a sudden not recognize anything for weeks even after resets an restarts then one day out of the blue its recognizing again, again no big deal but strange. That goes on for about 6 months an for me not a deal breaker but NOW its no longer reading my heart rate so that means it won’t track my sleep which is one of the main reasons why I decided to purchase this at the time $200 watch so I’ve lived with that feature not working for awhile on top of the still strange things going on an NOW i’m really irritated cause on top of all of my previous problems now it wont sync my steps to any of my friends challenges so if a record 15,000 steps in a day a weekly challenge an all my friends have 1,000 it still shows me at 0 and in dead last. Now I can deal with all of the glitches an things stop working after having it for so long but if I can’t whoop up on my friends in challenges i’m DONE!!! Sorry Fitbit we had a good run but i’m moving to Apple for the same price with more features",1

He matter of factly stated that he would have sent it back had I not been here to get the rest of the stuff setup for him.

0,"I have bought 3 versions of fitbit since they first came out. The second one lasted the longest at 2.5 yrs (Charge?).My latest, Versa 2, made it 1.5 yrs. The control button stopped functioning, which basically interferes with your ability to control any functions. Their warranty is good for 1 yr, so all they offered was a 35% discount.I am done with them. Wasted too much money on watches that never last.I bought my husband a Garmin version (it has the added golf fearture) and it has had no issues. (and he is not easy on anything).",1
1,"I got the Fitbit versa 2 because I had hoped that it would encourage me to exercise more. It turns out that it did. I set some reasonably easy goals at the beginning and kept on adding time or steps as I reach those goals. I really think the Fitbit has helped me a lot. I was a little bit unsure whether the tracker would look too big on my wrist and stand out in a negative way. I have small wrists and generally don't wear big watches because of that. But the watch looked great on my wrist using the small wristband. A large wristband is included as well. The activity that I track are spinning, walking, and aerobic activity thus far. The Fitbit automatically detected the latter two activities. The spinning as well as other activities can be selected on one of the watch menus. I have worn the watch to bed a few times to see how it tracks asleep. It presents a fair amount of data but doesn't really tell you what it means or what to do with it. I like the ability to choose my watch face. There are hundreds to choose from and many are free. Texting works okay on the watch but it could be a bit more consistent. I haven't used the watch for payment or music control yet. I'm really happy with my purchase and would recommend this watch to most people.",5
0,"I'm very disappointed with this fitbit. My versa started getting black lines down the screen so when the versa 2 was available for $50 less on amazon I decided to upgrade. I chose the versa 2 because of the Alexa feature and the 6+ day battery life. I've had this for 8 days bow and I've had to charge it 3 times. The battery drains like crazy and I don't use it any more than my last fitbit. I have all of the features set on the basic setting (auto-brightness, screen timeout to 10 seconds, etc.) And I hardly even use the Alexa feature because 1. I didn't read anywhere that you had to hold the button down to use it, kinda defeats the hands-free purpose I was hoping to use it for, and 2. It really serves no purpose other than setting a timer, which is actually faster to just open the timer app and set it. I'm hoping as time goes by maybe there will be an upgrade to give it more functionality, but the terrible battery life is enough for me to return it. Really frustrating.",2
1,"I’m always the one who performs consumer research before buying a product, especially one that I care about. I chose the versa over an Apple Watch after deciding what my needs were. I wanted a true fitness tracker and nothing more. I don’t need my watch to text, call or make POS purchases. I wanted to simply track my steps, my weight, sync with workouts, etc and this watch does that. While apple watches does this too, it’s used as a smart device for other things and for the price, I didn’t need the extra stuff. Set up was sort of a pain as I had syncing issues with my iPhone. I had to use Google to understand how to sync properly. I uninstalled then reinstalled the app and that did the trick.One thing I failed to notice was that while a number of fitness tracking watches sync with the iPhone, versa Fitbit does not. I have to pay additional $$ for an app that will sync the two if that’s what I want. I like all of my health metrics in one place for ease of use and appreciate apple’s health ecosystem, but the fact that Fitbit won’t auto sync to it kind of sucks.The band that comes with the watch was pretty comfortable. In the past I’ve often fumbled with watches so that they’d be comfortable on my wrist plus I sweat a lot during workouts and wanted a separate band for workouts only so that I didn’t mess up the original band. What you see in the pic is an additional band I purchased.For the price, it performs exactly as intended with a few extra surprises such as hourly reminders to meet steps goals. It also syncs with my weight scale, which was another Amazon purchase. I’m still unlocking many of the features so maybe I’ll post an updated review once I’ve had more time getting used to it.Fitness trackers have evolved since the days of a clip pedometer. I can appreciate all of the perks, but would love Fitbit to improve its software for maximum use.",4
0,"I paid $160 for this on a sale. I was excited to get it. I had a cheaper smart watch before this one that was $30 and it served me well for six months, despite being fully submerged in water on accident before. I didn't know if I'd like a smart watch which is why the first one was cheap. So when I stepped up to something over 5x the price range I was shocked to see the touchscreen become unresponsive in less than three weeks. This was under very light and careful usage, never submerged... How does a $160 watch just break for no reason when my old $30 one still works just fine?I did a little bit of research and discovered this seems to be a common problem with the Versa 2. So I'm guessing these reviews are misleading because they just continue to give you replacements. I don't want a replacement though, I want my money back. Idk, this quality wasn't what I expected. Doesn't feel like I'm getting what I paid for it.",1
1,"While I still have issues with Fitbit Premium, this review is specifically about the watch itself. Bought it in October to replace my Charge 3 since I'd decided to go the smartwatch route. Honestly, it worked fine until this week when all of a sudden I noticed a burn mark on my wrist. I clean the back of the watch lightly with a tiny bit of water and a soft cloth, dry it completely off so it doesn't get funky, and then charge it. 3 days later I still have a very red rough patch on my wrist so I'll not be using this again. Given the amount paid for this I'm not very happy. I checked the FitBit forum and apparently this is not unusual with many people stopping sleep use and no response from FitBit???!!! Not using it for sleep isn't an option - it's the primary reason I bought it, so I""m out $177 +/- and guess I'll go back to using my Charge 3.",3

In the 3 1/2 weeks that I had it, it only said that I slept 2 times, each time for only 1.5 hours, while I was actually asleep for over 8 hours!3.) steps tracking: I set a goal of 250 step an hours, I work in an office, I would stand up and stretch after sitting all hour and it would vibrate telling me congrats on walking 250/250 for the hour without taking even 1 step !!!Returned it an got my money back!!!",1
0,"This product was a failure on several levels. For one thing, it didn't work right out of the box. I contacted customer support, and the nice man confirmed that it didn't work. I certainly could have returned it for a replacement, but for the second reason why it failed. This product is not for the technically challenged. I was hoping this would be a stand - alone product, but alas not so. You have to get the damned thing to sync either with your cell phone or a computer where the fully functional apps need to be installed. It is the sync stage where the product failed so I couldn't actually use it because it didn't update itself. I realize that the technical trend these days is to make everything sync with everything else, with instant Internet updating, and all the rest of it. But this rush to technical prowess leads to multiple unnecessary layers of complexity, any of which can get really screwed up. Fitbits are a clever idea, but their reliance on additional devices for fully functional capability is unfortunate.",1
0,"I have owned a Fitbit Blaze for about 3 years, and based on its performance, I decided to purchase a Fitbit for my wife. Earlier this year, I bought a Charge 3 for her. This watch soon started to have synchronization issues and soon after, I bought her a Versa, assuming that this updated model would be more dependable. This Fitbit #2 seemed to work well until a few weeks ago. Then, it became more erratic in its measurements and then finally died - wouldn't even turn on. About a week ago, I purchased Fitbit #3 - a Versa 2. This watch lasted for a few days and then refused to sync with the app. I searched the web for a solution, only to find that a large number of purchasers had the same kind of problem that I was experiencing. This Fitbit #3 is going back to Amazon and will be replaced with an Apple Watch. I was really sold on Fitbit with my Blaze, but when it eventually dies, I will be replacing it with an Apple Watch as well. Three strikes and you're out, Fitbit. I don't know what your problem is, whether it's a software issue or shoddy quality control or something else - I don't intend to give you another chance to disappoint me. Three watches in one year and all failures? Can't say I didn't give you a chance!",1

It is supposed to connect to a PC using Windows 10 but that only worked during the setup process but then the PC dropped the device from the Bluetooth list and refused to connect again.

0,"Fitbit launched the Versa 2 with big fanfare but after using it for a week, I can state that this is a product which was hurriedly put together. Biggest problem is the Wifi connection, which keeps dropping even though you connect through the app. Without Wifi it's unable to download any updates and you cannot use Alexa functionality. There are tons of reviews which are pointing to this issue with Wifi and Bluetooth disconnections in the Fitbit Help community. Watch is decent size with functionality but without Wifi it's a piece of garbage. Google has bought Fitbit and hopefully, they would be able to improve the hardware and software. Lastly, the Wifi chip being used by Versa 2 is about 1mm in size and it's not powerful at all. Fitbit's solution; move your watch closer to the Wifi router or hotspot!!! Seriously??! What is the use of Wifi if the watch cannot connect??",2

If I had wanted to buy a refurbished Versa2, I could have saved more than half the price of the new one. I don't want REFURBISHED. A company that does not stand fully behind their product and does not make the buyer ""whole"" again, is not a company I will ever buy from again.BEWARE OF THIS COMPANY.

After contacting Fitbit we were told they won't replace, just offer a discount on a new one. Not acceptable! Are the Fitbit watches only built to last less than a year?? The second watch only lasted 6 months and not replaceable? Sounds like a ploy to force you to constantly repurchase their product. Terrible business model!! Currently looking for an alternative smart watch! Only purchase if you want to replace in less than a year!",1
1,"I have used Fitbit products in the past and generally been a fan. I have switched between smart watches from other major brands and Fitbit throughout the years due to the more integrated functionality of the others. I was excited to see this watch because as a fitness tracker Fitbit has been my favorite. I run a lot and it seems to be one of the best as far as accuracy for me. I have seen others reviews and I am not sure how they are using it or why they have issues, but I have tested the accuracy on one of my regular run routes that I know exact distance with several different devices and the fitbit seems to be pretty dead on. My pace is pretty steady and the Fitbit seems pretty accurate from what I normally see.It does leave something to be desired with the integration of messages and control of the phone. The lack of a speaker is a little upsetting also. I honestly have not really dug into the settings yet to see if there are tweaks to make it more functional for what I want it to do, but that's because the app is a little hard to navigate and figure out. I honestly don't care though because the primary use for me is to track my runs and it is doing that great.If you are looking for a true smart watch I would suggest that you keep looking because this is more of a fitness tracker with some features of a smart watch. I haven't figured out how to use Alexa, but maybe that will make it better. Overall I'm happy with the device and would recommend.",4

The parts online are 35$, but there are shockingly few parts, and even fewer repair shops. They responded and sent me a discount code I could use to buy a replacement. 35% off a watch that isn't on sale. I bought my first watch for 129$. With this discount applied, replacing the same watch would cost 124$, with recent markups.Fitbit, I've been your customer since before I knew you could have a Fitbit account. I've bought and given watches to people as gifts or encouragement. The fact that it is so difficult to get a manufacturer to repair something, rather than having it end up in a dump is pathetic.

For my weight, I will need to walk 10 miles for that many calories to burn!When I turned it on, the instruction to install the app was indistinct and kept cycling languages very quickly. I had to resort to YouTube!At the moment, i'm giving 3 stars. Will update after some more usage.Edit: The heart beat computation is off, compared to manual check of the pulse. But this is not a medical device and taken as a rough guidance, the heart beat count is acceptable - after all the watch does move about. But the other functions are woefully inadequate. In addition to the appalling step count error, the exercise monitors are inaccurate. The two main functions of a ""fitness"" device.The plus point: It is very light and sometimes, I do not even know that I'm wearing it.I have not used the subscription exercises - I do not have much confidence in this device and am not overly keen on blowing more money!For me, this does not work.

You can get new bands, face plates, and even customize the screen itself. In the picture attached you can see I’m using an 80’s theme that I personally really love. There are 100’s of themes to choose from though. Bands and face plates obviously will cost you, and some of the themes will as well (they have free ones too!). Inexpensive and worth it though if you want to really customize it. Lots of apps you can add as well!It tracks a lot! I love the sleep tracking feature. It really opened my eyes to my sleeping habits, and has actually helped me get better rest. This wasn’t a selling feature for me at all, but it will be in the future. It also counts steps, calories burned, exercise, etc.. Really can’t complain at all.The calls and text alerts are super cool as well. Alexa could be a little better, but does work. Overall we are very satisfied.",5
1,"I was a previous owner of the first Fitbit Versa and the battery lasted around 4 days and I thought that was amazing. But on the Fitbit Versa 2 the battery will last almost a full 7 days for me! I use it 6 days a week for working out. I love the step tracker. After my first Fitbit Versa I decided to try out the new Samsung watch active. I tried it out for almost 30 days but I couldn't take the fact that the step counter was always off, I mean way off. So I returned it and bought the Fitbit Versa 2. I am so glad I went back to Fitbit. I am having fun with the new Alexa feature. It doesn't do a whole lot but it's a great bonus feature. The screen is clear. The heart rate monitor seems to be spot on. I am just loving this watch! It is worth the money! If you are debating about weather or not to buy this watch STOP debating and just buy it you won't regret it.",5
0,I ordered this product in November 2020. It has had only six months and it is not working any more. Completely dead and impossible to bring it back to life after following all tech instructions. This is not a cheap item. Go for an Apple watch. I bought one for my son together with the Fitbit and the Apple is working perfectly well.,1
0,"Great product while it worked; two months and 9 days after using, it just stopped. Black screen. Nothing. Kaput. Not happy.Edited to add: Fitbit did replace that first faulty one, which I received in November. Again, loved it until the firmware update in January—now it will not correctly record heart rates during exercise. The numbers are off — way, way off, as much as 90 BPM during intense workouts.That issue was not present before. The community forums are filled with posts from users experiencing a multitude of problems all due to that update.And Fitbit (as well as Google, since they now own Fitbit) will not take responsibility for the issue — they’ve been completely silent about it.Lo and behold, in 2013-14 they (Fitbit) were involved in a class action suit regarding a similar HR issue.Again I really do love the product itself, owned different models over the course of the last 5-plus years.At this point though — never again.",1
0,"I bought this as an early Christmas gift for my husband. Once received, I realized his phone (S5) wasn't compatible. So, ordered a Galaxy S7, as, per Fitbit website, it WAS compatible. It's not. The OS is 6.0 with no updates available. My chat with Fitbit was maddening. All I can really report is that it took us over an hour to get the band on the cursed thing (Fitbit must change that!!) and advise to ensure that your device is indeed compatible. Don't just go by the information on the Fitbit website. I either have to purchase another new phone or just send the thing back. I feel terrible because I was so excited to give it to him, and he was thrilled to get it. Total fail. :(",1
1,"I like the device as a personal fitness reminder, but I don't think that it is accurate regarding steps. It may be me, but I don't think I'm making as many steps as this device is saying I am. I appreciate the fact that I can see how many calories I have burned and my heart rate. Two of my favorite features is the weather app and the alarm. Being able to be in a meeting and having the ability to see if it is snowing or not is a big plus. As it relates to the alarm, I appreciate the fact that it wakes you up slowly so that you aren't groggy.The band can get sweaty and uncomfortable to wear if you are working out.After a few months of wear, I have really come to depend on my fitbit. The calorie counter is great and the workouts are awesome.",4
1,"So everything about this watch is super cool! My only issue with it is that it gave me this (friction?) burn on my arm.The manual says you should take it off for an hour a day, which I take it off anytime it gets wet (which is often, i’m a stay at home mom so I clean a lot and have a baby who is constantly needing to be hosed down.) So the watch is off of my wrist for at least 4 hours out of the day.My problem is that I love to use the sleep tracker, but I’m afraid that when I’m sleeping is when it gets pressed against my skin too tightly and causes the friction burn. I don’t actually know for sure, that’s just a guess. It could have happened at any point in time because I didn’t notice it for a while. I noticed it’s the watch only because it’s the same size and area that the band sits. Hope there’s a solution to this sometime as functionality is actually great unless the watch is sitting too loosely, which is why I tightened it and ended up with the burn I’m guessing.**My sister has a different fitbit than the Versa 2 and has the same burn on her arm, but she thought it was from falling asleep with lime juice on her after a night of tequila shots. I don’t drink so now we know it’s definitely the watch 😂",3
1,"I had the Fitbit Blaze before this one and wow, is the Versa an upgrade. I was hesitant to buy a new one at first because I wanted to wait for something better to come out but after combing through a TON of reviews, I landed on this one.There are some sync issues similar to what I experienced with the Blaze, mostly having to do with texts and calls not coming through.I was also worried about it being too large for my wrist from looking at some photos of other women's but it looks smaller than my old one. I like how you can download other apps and even use it to pay like an apple watch. I've also found it useful that it has more exercises stored on the watch itself for tracking.Oh, and..... you can get really cute clock faces :)",5
1,"I’ve had the versa 2 for a long time and decided to stick to t rather than get a newer model as I don’t like the esthetics and the feature upgrades on new models weren’t critical to my needs. Fitbit are true activity trackers and also track sleep relatively well (Unlike the Apple Watch, hence my choice of Fitbit). The app is well designed as well, it has a premium option you can pay for, I don’t use it.(I had to replace my two year old Fitbit versa 2 because the plastic face cover suddenly started coming out of the frame constantly.). I’d recommend the versa 2 to anyone who wants a serious activity tracker",5
0,"I have noticed that I have to charge this fitbit Versa 2 very often, so I noted in my daytimer when I charged it to keep track. I charged on Thursday evening, wore the watch Friday to the gym. Today Sunday morning at 7:45AM I get notice, that the battery is low. What? I had a fitbit One for over 12 years, there was no charging problem. It finally gave up. Guess they don't make products to last anymore. I mainly want it for sleep tracking, it didn't track consistently either. I'm returning it.",1
1,"I purchased the versa 2 watch after all the buttons of my pebble fell off.I was unable to find a similar watch, a smart watch that you can make it dumb when you want. Where Airplane mode really is airplane mode and turns off everything like sensors but actual watch remains on.I only needed 3 things in a watch.Always on DisplayGood programmable alarmNotificationsThe pebble did a great job with all 3.So far in my experience with the Versa2.ConsNotifications are not reliable at times I get a phone call on it after I already answered the call...probably 30 seconds late.Sleep tracking is not reliable, said I went to sleep at 12am instead of before 11pm.Many times forces me to turn on location when I don't want it on, like when it syncs with phone.Pro:I am very happy with alarmI tried Alexa for the first time and I like itBattery life seems as expectedSummary:I will not return watch, seems like there is a big gap in the quality of the hardware and the beta feeling if the software.",3
1,"Not having worn a watch in close to 50 years, I wasn't sure if I would like this. I researched out the smart watches, and this seem to have the features I wanted at a reasonable price, so I got one. And I love it! The silicone band is comfortable, and the watchface is a good size. The display is crystal clear, and the colors are rich. I do like to track the various health parameters (especially steps as I have back problems so walking is a challenge for me some days). I also like the feature that as long as my cell phone is in the house I get notifications when email and text messages come through.",5
1,"Love the Versa 2. This was an upgrade for me from the original Alta (which I got because I didn't know if I would use/need all the features of the fancier (*more expensive) options.) I really love having all the features - waterproof, measures heart rate and sleep cycles, counts steps and flights of stairs, activity reminders, bluetooth integration. It does both automatic and manual tracking of a variety of exercises - walking, biking, hiking, running, yoga, etc. - and gives a total time, pacing, avg. and peak heart rate, calories burned. The color combination is pretty and the are several replacement band options you can also order. I highly recommend getting a screen protector also, I scuffed my screen protector 2 days after getting it and was glad I had already put it on. Amazon had a great sale price over the holidays - as low as I could find anywhere for the Versa 2.",5
1,"After getting myself a smaller version Fit Bit device, my wife decided that she wanted one that could keep up with the steps, along with the heart rate. We saw this on sale on the Amazon site and purchased this for her. This has been a great motivation for her to get moving around more and to remind her that she needs to get moving. It pairs well with your phone device (both of ours are I-phone) and lets you know if your phone rings, keeps a great clock with all of the other great features. She had purchased one a few years ago that didnt have all of the same features that this one has, but didn't stay as focused and motivated with that as she is with this device. Maybe it helped that she noticed I was making changes in my lifestyle and felt she needed to do the same, but regardless of the situation, I am glad that she chose getting back into better health and she bought this device. And getting this on Amazon was so much cheaper (at least 50.00 less) than one of the major stores selling them. Definitely worth the investment and I encourage anyone thinking about getting one to buy this one.",5
1,"I’ve had this fitness tracker a little over 2 weeks and like it but don’t think it’s worth the price tag. The battery literally only lasts for 3 days if you actually use it and its features like the exercise app., alarm clocks etc.I had purchased a much less expensive fitness tracker but had to return it because it didn’t track my steps when running on the treadmill which was pretty frustrating.This tracker is comfortable and doesn’t bother me when doing push-ups or when weight lifting. I’ve used the app before so I’m familiar with it.Haven’t had the opportunity to run with it bc I live in New England and it’s to dark by the time I get out of work.Also the versa seems to discount from the app quite frequently. This may add to the battery dying if it’s constantly trying to search for the phone.",3
0,"I have owned a couple Fitbits and was very happy with the Versa 2. That was until this week. When charging the watch I received the red exclamation point and now the watch is stuck in an update loop. I have been in contact with customer support and they tried to help, but once everything failed to fix the watch they were quick to let me know that it was out of the warranty period by 46 days. There did offer me a 35% coupon code to use on their website (which is the highest price on the market). It is just very disappointing that this device only lasted a year. Until this point it worked very well and would recommend it. Just be prepared to replace it on a yearly basis.",1
1,"I absolutely love my FitBit Versa 2! I ordered one for myself and one for husband. I have an iPhone and he uses a Samsung Galaxy. I don’t get all the benefits of text and calling from the device itself, but I do love the I can have all my apps alerted to my watch. I find that the watch is pretty accurate on sleep cycles and heart rate. I think the steps may be off slightly. My only grunt with it, is that it has caused both my husband and I to breakout on our wrists. Mine is a chemical burn, and his is more of a rash. I’m not sure what is in the bands specifically that has irritated both of our skin. If they have metal band replacements, I think we will try those instead of the rubber bands that come with it.That said, we do recommend these watches for those who want a comparable option in price and uses to the Apple Watch. If you have an iPhone and don’t mind not using your watch for being able to answer calls or text back, then this is a great alternative! You can still get text, call, and app alerts... you just can’t use the feature fully. Hope this helps!",4
1,"So kinda disappointed with the smart watch but honestly haven't been able to find anything remotely close to as good as my old Pebble 2+ heart.Pros:Color touch screenSome search abilities through AlexaWater proofPrice semi reasonable.Cons:Does not sink well to your phone and looses connection often.Can't text to someone in your contacts but can text back if they text first.Doesn't sink to work emailBattery only lasts a couple days.Only notifys of message or calls if phone is on vibrate or ring. This is one of the biggest cons for me as I'd use my watch in meetings to notify me while my phone being on silent.Also add the band gives my arm a rash.Currently, for the price it does not seem like there is a watch than can meet up to the Pebble 2+heart, but sadly pebble was bought up. If you're looking for a semi ok smart watch and really want a touch screen fitbit versa 2 seems to work ok. If you want it for exercising it may be helpful though I wasn't interested in that portion so don't use that capability much.",3
1,"Bought this watch to replace an aging Fitbit charge HR. Do not own a mobile phone so I was looking for a watch that would sync with my iPad which the Versa2 does nicely. Biggest concern with the charge hr was that I could not read it outside ..period, not so with the Versa2. This watch has an automatic adjusting screen light and is is nicely visible in the strongest sunlight, love it!!! Only a month in so I can’t comment on longevity or customer support . Not having a smart phone in my pocket downplays some of the cool features of this watch but it hooks up with the iPad at about 40’ which works for me. So far... love this watch!!",5
0,"I was very disappointed in my Fitbit Versa 2. I had a Charge 2 for over 2 years and liked it. I suspected it might be undercounting steps by a little, but it wasn't significant. When upgrading, I was debating between the Versa 2 and changing to an Apple Watch Series 3. I have all Apple products (iPhone, iPad, Macbook), but given that I was comfortable with the Fitbit and the way it worked, I decided to stick with it. That was a huge mistake. While the normal steps walking around the house were probably fairly accurate, I quickly realized that when taking a long walk (I do 3.5 miles brisk walk in the morning), it was WAY under. It should have been around 8,000 steps and it was counting under 6,000. I even tested it by counting 500 steps in my head, and the Versa 2 only recorded about 350 or less. I went back and forth with Fitbit support many times, with them having me try different things (restarting the device, factory reset, etc). They tried to tell me it had to do with the way I was swinging my arms. I had a fitbit for over 2 years - I should be able to walk normally and get a relatively accurate count. They finally said that it was defective and that they would replace it. However, the only way they would do it was for me to send it back first, then have them take 5-10 business days to process the return, and then they would send me a new one. So they wanted me to go 2-3 weeks with no device at all. They wouldn't budge, and I gave up. I returned the Versa 2 and purchased an Apple Watch Series 3 instead. I LOVE the Apple Watch. Accurate step counts, great apps, easy to use once I got used to it. Only 2 things I don't like are that it doesn't have good sleep tracking, and the battery needs to be charged daily. But other than that, I'm thrilled with it. Much better than the Versa 2, and the same price.",1
1,comfy easy to install smart watch. set up only took 5 minutes,5
0,"If you are active and trying to use as a fitness tracker, do not bother with the Versa 2.1) This will not connect to your phone if not within cell service coverage. I bike, hike, run, in areas not in cell coverage. Even with Bluetooth enabled and initially connected in service range, the Versa 2 will not track steps or heart rate when outside cell service range, such as mountains and rural areas.2) Staying connected to my iPhone is a challenge. Frequently disconnects from phone. I must reopen the Fitbit app to reconnect, and as long as I am in cell service range.3) Want to log a quick fitness activity from your watch? Oh wait, I have to reopen Fitbit app to connect phone and GPS tracker. Otherwise the Versa 2 will be stuck in “connecting” mode and then will never log my activity. BTW, must again be in service range.4) No internet coverage or WiFi coverage? Versa 2 will not connect.Watch is almost useless as a fitness tracker. Very disappointed Fitbit!",2
0,"I was very disappointed with this Fitbit. I currently have a Fitbit Blaze and love it but thought it was time to upgrade since so much has changed in the last several years. I likes the size of the Versa 2, but did not like that I had to have the Fitbit app open on my phone for some of the features to work. I couldn’t get music to download to the Fitbit and I had to have a paid subscription to use the Pandora app. Also, I couldn’t get Alexa to work most of the time. It was either because I didn’t constantly have the app open on my phone (drains the battery) or because the Fitbit kept going offline on the Alexa app (never could figure out which one caused the problem). Either way after only a few days I was frustrated with it and decided it had to go back. I think I’m going to upgrade to an Apple Watch.",2
0,"I have been very disappointed with my purchase of the versa 2. The first one I had kept freezing up and would not allow you to swipe to another screen or use any of the functions. I received a second one that was new and I am now having the same problem with this one. It is constantly resetting itself and will not allow you to swipe to move to another screen. If the side button is pushed it will not come on nor let you access the alexa option. It will notify of a text or incoming call however, it will not let you respond to the text or answer/decline the call. It will then go dark and not come back on even when the side button is pushed. It will reboot itself and then work for a few minutes then nothing again. It is still tracking my steps, heart rate and sleep, I am only able to access the information through the app on my phone. So I now own a $200 dollar fitbit that doesn't do anything it's supposed to do and I am past the warranty period. Will not be buying any more fitbit products in the future.",1
0,"First, I did not like the fact that everytime I turned around it wanted me to sign up for Alexis. I didn't want Alexis and had no way to stop the requests.MOST IMPORTANTLY: It died only 3 months and 9 days after I bought it! I did over 20,000 steps on Feb. 21st. and by the 23rd. it was dead! I am very disappointed that I cannot return it either as the window of return time ended Jan. 31st. I highly recommend a different product instead. Maybe if it lasts longer than that and the others are definetly cheaper anyway even if you only get that amount of time out of them. I did not wear it in water, I protected it with the lens covers and took very good care of it. I feel like I was dooped! tricked or whatever you want to call it!",1
1,"The app was a little hard to figure out. Took some trial and error to learn to click on the profile pic in the app then click on Versa2 to work within the app. Once figured out you also realize that you can manually sync the app to the watch from here as well. Hope that little tip helps anyone else who buys this product. Once you learn to move around in the app, it truly does help your awareness of your fitness. The only thing I didn't like was that there aren't more apps that work with the Versa2. Don't get me wrong there are quite a few, but there could be more. I'd like to see a few for diabetic health. We diabetics have to track everything it seems like from our blood sugar to testing times with results logged, to how often we pee, and how much. I also think there should be an app that allows us to track medications. With things like the type of medicine, how many pills prescribed, alarms for times they should be taken, and a pill inventory countdown, with the option to be notified when medication count drops below a certain number,which reminds someone to refill the prescription.",5
0,"I supported Fitbit for years and had little to no problems with my watches. I purchased this watch as a Black Friday deals when it first came out and have had several problems with it recording accurate steps, sleep, time, etc. I’ve had to restart the watch several times and had to contact support for it. This year 2020, I got a new phone (Samsung Galaxy S10e and my watch won’t show incoming txt messages, phone calls, or my calendar events. I’ve contacted Fitbit several times, restarted it several times with no success. Fitbit finally told me to wait for the next Fitbit update.",1
1,"(Blake's wife) Never had an activity tracker/sleep tracker before. I think this thing is awesome. Steps are a bit out of whack (registered 54 steps while I was sleeping), but nothing I'm going to complain about. The app can be a little wonky to figure out, but I liked the package so much I got the Premium membership. I don't really know how accurate the sleep tracker is without a sleep study, but it works perfectly fine as far as I need it to.If you're super anal retentive and need everything to be perfect, then don't bother buying any of them. But as far as I'm concerned, this is close enough. Also, I was afraid this thing might be too big (I have arms like sticks, 5.75 ""), but it's okay, if a little big, but it doesn't look ridiculous on my skinny little wrist. I think the food counter could be a lot more involved, but then, I don't use that part of the app anyway. I probably should have bought the Charge 4, as I don't need Alexa, but this thing and its app are way cool.",5
0,For the 1 year and 7 months that this watch worked - it was great. Then the battery died and there is no replacing. After researching I found that many experienced the same thing and Fitbit customer service was of no use. You basically have to buy a new watch. $170+ is a lot for a watch that doesn't last 2 years in my opinion. Fair warning.,1
1,"I do like the watch but there are pros and cons.Pros: lots of cool features like Alexa, choice of watch faces, large screen, always on feature and high resolution screen.Cons: Setup required a large system update which wouldn't complete so I had to call tech support. After a half-hour they got it working. Battery life only lasts 2 days when using the always on feature. It also has connection issues when not on my home network making the ability to look at my grocery list at the grocery store near impossible, I have to get my phone out still. I got the watch so I wouldn't have to one-hand push a grocery cart anymore but this watch didnt solve that problem. It also will not connect to my Echo smart speakers thru blutooth. Finally, there's no way to connect to Amazon music, only Spotify premium and Pandora Premium, not even the free versions. Which means I can't use it to control my music unless I want to pay for yet another service.Sum Up: it's a great watch for step tracking and in home smart house control but if you need to use Alexa or music services outside the home you may want to wait for a future update.",4
0,"I ""upgraded"" to Versa 2 when my Versa stopped working after 1 year. The first Versa 2 was inaccurate after 2 days. It just kept my stats from the day before and adding on. So, I had 15,000 before 9am when I woke up at 7am. I went back & forth with Versa customer service, factory resetting, restarting, etc. Finally they just sent me a replacement -by the way - it's just the watch part so if you ever try this don't trash the old one bc you will need the band!! Same thing happened. It just added on the info from the previous one until I gave up and started a new account. Has worked for a couple weeks, but I just woke up with yesterdays stats again. I tried factory resetting like before, but that didn't work. I'm not starting a 3rd account. Have already put the original in them mail for a return and sending the replacement back to Fitbit. Giving up and going to Garmin.",1
1,"Bought the Versa 2 in June 2020 and it worked perfectly until about a month ago when the Alexa feature quit working suddenly. Not sure what happened but after checking online I see that a lot of other people are having the same issue. I've tried all the tips and tricks to get it work, even cold booting it a few times, but no luck. It just thinks for a few seconds then goes to the ""Try Asking Alexa..."" screen pictured above, every time and does nothing. Weird thing is that when I receive a phone call I can talk and be heard, so I know the microphone is working.Aside from this, all other features (so far) are working great. I really like the look of this smart-watch, it is very comfortable to wear, and the battery lasts for about 4 days even with notifications turned on. If the Alexa feature was working I would give this review 5 stars.",3
1,"The versa 2 has many nice features including the always on display and a brighter and higher res screen. But the heart rate function for me is erratic. I do have PVCs which cause an irregular heart rate but the versa 1 had no issues providing a stable and accurate readout. While sitting still the versa 2 will show a reading in the low 50's which is normal for me but then after awhile it will jump to 80-100 with no movement on my part. I tried wearing the versa 1 and versa 2 (one on each wrist) and the two would read the same most of the time based on my activity level, but the versa 2 would periodically go up and stay up for awhile. But if I turned the heart rate function off then on (under Settings), the reading would drop back to where it should be. I have replaced the versa 2 but experienced the same results, so it is the software vs the hardware. Disappointed in the loss of functionality.",3
1,"This fitbit REQUIRES location services to be enabled to sync the fitbit with the android app. Their reasoning is thats its for the gps, weather, etc however I do not have a need for any of those features. It won't function unless it can snatch your data even more than it already does.",3
0,"Mine stopped tracking my heart rate immediately after a firmware update last month. Fitbit's answer was, ""too bad, so sad. We feel your pain, so here's a 35% off coupon... go buy a new watch.""Ummm. No! This thing cost north of $250 a year and a half ago, and was working up until Fitbit pushed a BAD firmware update. I will not be spending any more money with this company. And while I'm not expecting an heirloom quality timepiece for my 250 bucks, I was expecting a piece of computing hardware that would last for more than 18 months.Buyer beware. IMO, Fitbit does not stand behind their product. Read the warranty carefully, firmware is likely not represented as a design defect in craftmanship (even though it should be) so it won't be covered when they break your device (at least that was my case - 12 months, hardware only)..Before the bad firmware update, I would have ranked this watch as a 4. It holds a charge for a long time (several days), but the charging points are a weak design (4 pogos you have to line up and then push hard to get seated and check twice to ensure proper charging begins. You get used to it). The Fitbit app is mediocre. Your primary stats are easy enough to find and navigate through, but the ""shopping"" experience for watch apps is difficult.",1
1,"The food log on the Fitbit app gives you a perfect breakdown of the 3 macronutrients that are the foundation of keto. It shows and logs exactly how many carb, protein, and fat grams are in each items you are eating and places them into a pie chart that includes all foods throughout the day, so you can make sure that you are hitting your keto goals. I have lost 7lbs since I purchased this watch because of the Fitbit app.As for the accuracy, the steps can be a little annoying as you start with so many per day. If I type with it on, it will add steps, BUT when you place it in exercise mode, specifically the treadmill setting when exercising, the watch is incredibly accurate. Not kidding, when you take steps, you can see it adding steps in rhythm to your gait. This was perfect for me as I was interested in my fitness tracking, not so much my steps while working as I have a sedentary occupation.It has allowed me to download music onto the watch that pairs w/ my bluetooth headphones, thus I get to leave behind my phone -this seems like a godsend. I can exercise with much less weight. This is one of my favorite features, and the Deezer music app is legit.I highly recommend this product.",4
0,"I upgraded from the original Versa to the 2, and after a month have gone back. Here's why: It's thicker! And heavier. Yuck! The trade off is the battery life is great, but my old watch could go 2.5 days - so, good enough for me. Screen wasn't any bigger -disappointing. And it wasn't as bright as the original Versa, even on its max setting. Thought it would have a stronger vibration as it has 3 levels in the settings, instead of 2 like on the original Versa, but it wasn't any stronger. I did like being able to reply to text with voice, and that worked well. But for me, all the things I didnt like about it, including the color, which was not a pretty rose gold, but copper, out weighed the improved battery life and voice control upgrades. Some things are worth sticking to and the original Versa is one for me.",2
0,"5 stars for all the features of the Versa 2. Amazing features and tracking abilities. However, negative 4 stars for all FitBit durability. If you buy this, or any FitBit, get the extended warranty.The first FitBit I bought lasted 3 years before the battery wore out. Since then, I’ve purchased 3 additional FitBits, each one of them lasting about 6 months before dying. Received a replacement for each of the 3 dead FitBits and they also lasted about 6 months. My wife had the same experience.After going through this over and over, we bought my wife an Apple Watch and she loves it. Now that this Versa 2, purchased in October, 2020, has died, I’ve given up and ordered an Apple Watch as well.Goodbye FitBit, your quality has declined to the point it is no longer worth it!",1
1,"I've had it for about a year. The sleep tracking accuracy stopped working after about 6 months. I don't pay for the plus plus to make it work to it's full potential. Didn't realize you had to pay a monthly fee to utilize all it's stuff. I wore it all the time when I first got it. Rarely wear it now that its accuracy is way off on the sleep tracking. There are some nice features, like the breathing app, but mine doesn't seem to work right. As a working mom, it seems a bit time consuming. Oh well. Still wear it when I hike and walk to get an idea of how far I went. Like the heart rate feature and the period tracker. Really bummed it takes a techy person to figure out how to get music on it! Wouldn't buy again.",4
0,"I'm a satisfied Versa owner - so I purchased a Versa2 via Amazon US to use there and in Asia, as I work in both places. Given the limited difference between old and new models, the main benefit I was looking for was to use Alexa to control timers and alarms. Unfortunately Fitbit chooses NOT to enable Alexa for Hong Kong - this is very strange I use use Echo Alexa extensively there (I have 1 Tap and 2 Dots). All work well and are controlled thru the mobile app. Why would Fitbit choose not to implement Alexa outside of the US when Amazon clearly have done a great job implementing it???Secondly, the quality of the watch is definitely worse than on the original Versa - my 2nd photo shows the white scratch on the back at the 5 o'clock position .However, there is some good news - the ""always on"" watch face, simpler implementation of choosing up to 5 alternative watch faces, and dramatic cut in price (originally $199, I paid US$149 on Black Friday 2019 but it is now $128) means it continues to do a great job of sleep tracking, step counting, all with a reasonable battery life.Just have to hope Google's takeover will result in Fitbit becoming more global and ensuring they more accurately explain the limitations of their Alexa integration!",1
0,"Be careful. If you have a technical issue with any FitBit product, esp if purchased through Amazon, FitBit will send you a shipping label. However, they do not tell you that the shipping will take your device and store it somewhere in a USPS facility indefinitely until your warranty runs out. I have about 2 weeks left on my warranty and it's been one month since I shipped it back. They are ""blaming"" USPS for doing this. I called them about this. They say it is FitBit's choice for method of service. The first let of shipping is UPS. There is no way to see or know that a second leg is given to USPS for STORAGE. Contacting the Consumer Protection Agency and Better Business Bureau and letting Amazon know how we are treated. This is my 4th FitBit device over the years this has made me angrier than a hornet.",1
1,"I really like this fitbit. Over the years I've tried a handful of different ones, none that had been smartwatches like this before. Overall this has been the best fitbit model I've tried to date. I've got the settings set up to save power and can go a week or more without charging it. So once a week I'll set it to charge while I'm showering and getting ready and that's usually enough to get it mostly charged or fully charged. I have tan/olive skin and although I haven't tried calibrating the fitbit for heartbeat accuracy, it's good enough for me to track regular versus fat burning versus cardio heart rates. The sleep monitor is also really handy but I do question some of the accuracy of that because some days I felt like I did not sleep well, the app gives me a decent rating. Oh well! Still really like the device.",5
1,"It is a very nice product and has a nice user interface, but I have found the only thing that separates this from the $29 Wyze band is that you can connect Bluetooth headphones and listen to music. However, the headphones will disconnect every song.Also, a huge issue for me was that this product completely misjudged the number of calories burned per daily steps. I work in maintenance in a manufacturing facility. At no point does my BP reach over 110 in the day, but this watch says that I burned over 2,000 calories walking 6,000 steps. It also was well over 1 ft off on my stride length even though I input my height, weight, and gender.I am downgrading to the wyze band which I had before the versa 2. The Alexa feature is exactly the same and it does a much better job tracking steps. The wyze band won’t display the number of calories burned, but I would rather not know my calories burned than have an absurd number on my screen.I also read an article (can’t confirm the quality of their sources) that the versa 2 is likely going to make people gain weight rather than lose it due to the unrealistic numbers the calories burned section displays. If the versa 2 were right, I would need to eat over 3500 calories per day as a 5’10, 156 pound male.It’s really unfortunate because this is such a nice band otherwise, and I think Fitbit is a great company so I hate to leave a bad review, but you can’t charge working people $160 for a watch when a competitor who has a less nice looking, but better working product only charges $29.In conclusion, this is a $30 product inflated over 500% its value simply because it is nicer looking than its competitor. Has a slightly nicer user interface too.My suggestion if you are considering this product is to do what I did. Purchase the wyze band first, wear it for a few days, then purchase the Fitbit versa 2. Return whichever one you don’t like.",3
0,"This watch has so many syncing problems its ridiculous. I have never been able to view messages from my watch. It will actually notify me that I have a text message but I can't actually open the message so basically useless. Other notifications such as IG messages pop up randomly and then randomly stop. It also randomly stops syncing with the mobile app and to try to re sync the watch it's a whole another problem, I had to restart the watch several times, turn on and off the bluetooth on my phone and still wouldn't work so I eventually had to impair the watch and pair it back again and even then the app is still saying the watch isnt syncing every other day. I just dont thi k that any device that costs $200 should have as many issues as this device. I have a Note 10+ so idk if these syncing problems happen with apple as well but regardless, like I said before not worth the price with all these annoying problems.",2
1,"Day 1: 12:50 am I get my watch and update it, sync it, etc. The process is easy and painless but takes a bit of time.Of course, the band is too small so I take it off to replace it with the included larger one.Here is where the frustration set in. This band is trash. Whoever designed it should be fired.And according to the help pages, this is the second-gen to use this awful design. The pin is really small, which is fine, but that rubbery, awful band fights you. It is now 2:45 and I finally got it back on. It took me like an hour to deal with this garbage. It had better be worth it, I ended up having to stabilize the pin with a cloth (it stabbed under my thumbnail and cut me when I didn't), both thumbs are sore. I had to use a nail file to push the thing in place as it fought me...To be continuedStyle: It looks nice. Not a conversation starter or anything, but unobtrusive.",3
0,"When they work they are great, however, in my one year of warranty, I had the device replaced twice. This most recent time it died is just outside of warranty. Rather than replace the device for a third failure in 16 months, they offered a 35% off code for a new device from their shop, where the prices are higher than most retail. I've decided, as much as I like the app and interface, I'm going to have to go to an Apple watch. Fitbit's quality control is just too poor.",1
0,"I got this to track the calories I burn working out, and to track the quality of my sleep. Ill start by sating it does a great job tracking my sleep. But its primary purpose for me is flawed. I can't get an accurate heart rate reading that spans thelength of a single workout. Too many times will my heart be virtually ripping out of my chest and I look at this thing and its either blank, or hilariously telling me 90bpm. I work out hard, potentially too hard for this thing, I feel like the information it gives me in terms of calories burnt and time in certain heart rate zones are off by as much as 40-50%. Its a shame too because I felt like I was buying a higher end model to avoid this situation. Oh well, I'm still closer to knowing what I'm actually burning then if I didn't have one at all, I just wish it worked better.",2
0,"If all you want is a fitness watch this is a great watch, but if you want a smart watch that does everything it says it can, this is not the watch for you. I bought this watch because it said it paired with android phones. The fitness part of the watch paired nicely, the notifications did not pair at all. After spending numerous hours researching how to receive notifications and doing everything I was told, I still could not receive notifications. I even had a 1 hour live chat with fitbit only to be told android users are having problems receiving notifications. They do not know when or if this problem will ever be resolved for this model.At this point I chose to return the watch. Amazon was awesome and processed my refund without any problems.",1
0,"I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend. She received it on Christmas, wore it for less than 48 hours and the watch will not turn on. We have tried to do the factory reset but that won't work. The battery is fully charged, yet that icon appears as if it is not. I have now read other reviews regarding the matter and this seems to be a common practice. It breaks my heart to see her so upset. It's not worth it. Buy a different brand or the newer model. Fitbit and Amazon are aware of the problem and at this point are just taking people's time and money.",1
1,"I love this smart watch/fitness tracker. It nudges you along just enough, without managing to be annoying/discouraging. The sleep tracker is amazing! I really wanted an Apple Watch, but I’m not prepared to make payments on one, till my phone is paid off. And this was a great alternative to replacing with another simple pedometer/heart rate monitor. This far, I have done dishes, and ran in the rain, and smacked it on a few good, hard surfaces. Seems pretty sturdy, reasonably water resistant. Also, I downloaded the Bitmoji app from the clock faces, and now all of my animations, prompts, and clock faces are my bitmoji, egging me on! It’s pretty sensitive, so rocking in a rocking chair can confuse it. But pretty much everything shy of THAT, doesn’t seem to pose any problems with accurate exercise data. I used a predetermined course, with uphills and downhills, and walked and jogged it, with accurate data results. I love that it keeps track of oxygen saturation while you sleep. I’ve actually discovered all kinds of things about my sleep, and it’s enabled me to find ways to help myself get more restful sleep. Overall, totally worth the price.",4
0,"I was so happy when i got the Versa 2. I have never had watch like that and i was curious to see how it works. I loved the color and it fitted my hand perfectly. I love the sleep tracker, i have hard time to stay asleep so the watch was able to show me when i am awake and how i actually sleep per night. Tracking my steps and all worked well.BUT i had to return it, the screen just stopped responding to when i tap it or when i try to type my password. It will respond only when i press the button to show me the time....and that is only after 1 month of having it...i am really disappointed",2
1,"During this crazy times, I wanted to get back in shape. This watch is great since it track your activities such as heart rate and distance once you connect your phone. One underrated feature it has is the smart alarm where it wakes up up at your best rem cycle which is going to be between the time you set your alarm and 30 min before.The only issue I have is the connection issues sometimes when you switch from 4g to wifi. I always have to reconnect it. Also I think Alexa at least for me with the watch is a little useless.I wish for Spotify you can choose the song on your watch bit you can't. Anyway, other than that it is great!",4
0,"I am so dumb for buying a third fitbit. THEY ALWAYS BREAK AND WILL NEVER WORK PROPERLY!!! I just ran into the one billionth problem with my Versa 2. I had to unconnect and re do all this nonesense, and lost several hundred calories from my day and sync. It may not be a big deal to most people. But it's always the case. FITBIT IS NOT ACCURATE AND WILL NOT HELP YOU BESIDES A BROAD OVERVIEW! It's over priced, not usable trash. Go with Garmin, Apple, ANYONE except Fitbit.",1
1,"I love how well it tracks my steps and that i can get my messages and respond directly on my Fitbit in case i need to answer someone immediately. Works for both the Android and Apple watches. It also has a great ""find your phone"" feature I've used more than a few times! I wear it to bed at night to track my sleep and as my alarm. It vibrates on my wrist to wake me up. I use the timer feature when I'm cooking, which means i can set the timer and go outside and still ger back inside to take something out of the oven. Lots of great features I haven't even explored. I love it!",5
0,"I have had other smart watches. Battery life is always a big issue with me. What good is tracking sleep if you have to take the watch off each night to charge it. This watch can go 5 days on a single charge. Also I charge it at work for only a couple of hours and it is good for 5 more days. I love it. I plan to get my wife one. There are many other features that I have not even tried yet but plan on using them.5 month Follow up: Battery life is now not as good. 4 days at best. So it is trending down. But the most frustrating thing is that the watch face no longer allows ANY touch control. I just stopped. nothing I can do to get it to work again. Reset, restart, recharge all fail in getting this thing to function again. I look on the user forms and I am not the only one with this problem but there is NO response from fit bit on this. The watch just bricks. I do get the home screen so I still see my info and it still reports to my phone all the stats. But I can no longer tell it that I am starting a workout. Tough to recommend after 5 months.",2
1,"I owned a fitbit years ago, and I always had problems with syncing it to my phone. At one point, it wouldn't even pair to my phone. I believe many other people experienced that issue, too. When it came to searching for a smartwatch to track my exercise, I was hesitant to buy a fitbit again because of those issues.HOWEVER, this model is SO much better than they use to be. It pairs with my phone so easily. I've had it for 7 months now, and have had no issues. The battery lasts days. There are so many different watch faces to choose from, and most of them are customizable. There have been zero issues with the software, connectivity, or hardware. Fear the previous fitbit issues no more! They finally fixed it, and it works better than ever. Highly recommend this watch.",5
0,"Around half the time the watch wont sync to android phones even if you give the fitbit app priority and have it set to never sleep on your phone. Even with these ""fixes"" provided by fitbit the Versa 2 still fails to sync to the app about half the time ive been using it. That means that Alexa simply wont work even tho you have you phone on you all the time and it should be syncing but this product fails to deliver. It's a good concept for a watch and I was excited to get it and with the latest firmware update a week ago for the watch, it still didn't fix this problem. If you want the Versa 2's features to work all the time on android, maybe wait for them to fix it properly so it works all the time bc as of now, it just doesn't.",1
1,Omg in love with this watch! Super impressed with the battery life I think I could let it go for 6 days! Cute watch faces in the app. Lots of apps to choose from. It does everything it says in description as well. You can answer texts with your voice and it really keeps me motivated to move as I always lose track of time and don't realize how often I have been sitting. I like the versatility of setting up when I want reminders and how much I want to actually accomplish as well. I had some trouble syncing it at first and support responded to me immediately! I also think my phone case may have had an impact so I took it off and everything has been working just fine. Not as draining on my Galaxy S21 as I thought it would be either and I keep the app open all day!!! 10/10 in my book so far!,5
1,"The main reason I wanted this was to track my heart rate during workouts. I have full sleeve tattoos on both arms, and the device simply will not detect my pulse in my preferred position (top of left wrist). I had actually tried several of my friends' older / simpler fitbits and they worked fine in detecting my pulse, so that's really what led me to be disappointed with this device not being able to do so.Other than that, the ""smart"" features are just okay. FitOS is very barebones. It does the job, but it lags and the interface is simplistic. That said, nothing is outright broken. It just feels cheap and outdated.I'm probably in a minority on this, but I was disappointed that fitbit doesn't natively sync with Google Fit. I did find an app that will bridge the gap, but it causes a bit of data duplication.If I had it to do over, I would have either gone with a simpler device or a more full-featured device. The Versa 2 feels like a compromise in every way.",3
0,"I would love to give this smart, fitness watch 5 stars. I have used many Fitbit items for fitness tracking in the past and had no issues. I bought my watch here, on Amazon in August of 2020. Today, it gives me a solid, light blue or yellow-green, flickering screen and I cannot get it to work. I have gone through tons of forums and tried everything to fix it. Most people that have had the same problem say it is not fixable. I live outside the U.S. so it is not so easy to just send it back. I regret making this purchase because on top of the watch, I also bought a ton of bands and protective covers. As I stated, this is a known issue according to the forums and there was a rather high number of people complaining about the same problem.",2
1,"Great upgrade from my Alta HR! I wanted one of these for a while and did my research before buying. The reviews were mostly positive, but some noted issues here or there, including burns/rashes from wearing the band. I decided to order it anyway and also purchased a different band just in case. It arrived a day sooner than expected (next-day) and although the box had a ding, the contents were perfect. It was easy to put on and came with both small and large band attachments. I wore the small one for a bit before switching to large. I cleaned the bands with an alcohol wipe before wearing them just in case of the rash stuff lol. After a couple workouts it did well and seemingly accurately counted all my steps and HR measurements. Battery does well, but drains faster with the animated clock face so I changed that. The band slips with sweat so I adjusted that a few times as well to find a comfortable fit. Overnight, it must have spun itself around to my underwrist, causing a small chafing ""burn"" on my skin from the friction of the band rotating and rubbing. Not a big deal, it went away in less than a day. Today my new band arrived and I switched it, finding this new one to be much more comfortable since it's a cloth band ""scrunchie"" and not the rubbery one. It looks cuter too! Overall, a great buy! I purchased this for fitness tracking and it does a great job. I don't use it solely as a smart watch, but it does have some of those features like texts, reminders, alarms, caller ID, the Alexa feature which I have yet to try and my spotify which is👍",5
1,"I've been through two previous FitBit models because I forget to take them off when doing dishes and, ultimately, the water damages them. Big difference between water proof and water resistance!I waited a few months to see how this one would work before writing a review.First, the app is much improved over the 1.5+ years since my last one. I get reminders telling me to get up and move which I really need since I have a desk job and tend to sit too long for an extended period of time.The sleep and activity tracking seems to be more precise showing with more accuracy the different levels of sleep and activity I am getting.And, most importantly, it's water proof. Twice now I have gone into the shower and realized I still had it on. I immediately took it off but, so far, no damaged to the equipment. I've never taken it off when doing dishes and haven't had any issues. Now, do I dare take it swimming come summer? We shall see.",4

1,"No doubt this is a beautiful watch. Many reviews always highlight this since they wanted to says the good and skip the smart features which are the weakness. It's not full Alexa support. It's doesn't support Amazon music. You cannot change channel on Amazon cube. If your don't have premium on Spotify, you cannot use it. Apps are limited. Many apps need purchase. Some App like Welgreen installed but cannot link account. The premium Fitbit program need subscription. I only can says is it's good to match clothes. Not an excited smart watch. The battery life better the Moto 360 but worse than Pebble. I keep it since my Pebble has stop supporting. However, I wondered why Fitbit take so long but still cannot catch up with the old Pebble echo system which they make it disappears technically.",3

First let me explain our setup. I have a Fitbit ALTA HR which works fine and I have no problems managing it. My wife owns the newer VERSA 2 smart watch. I've been managing both from my cellphone which was working OK until last week when I could no longer get the VERSA 2 to synch. Here's what I've learned.a) Do not try to manage more than one device on one phone.b) Make certain that the two devices are not in the same room when you try to synch them.This has been working fine for that last few days.",3
0,"I have had it for less than a day but have already had nothing but problems. Setting up spotify took forever and still cant connect my hash 3 headphones directly to it to listen to spotify, only the music app. Notifications were sporadic and I couldnt even respond to them through the watch so it's pointless since I need my phone then. It didnt even work right as a step counter either. I barely walked to and from class and it said I walked 3000 steps that day which is outrageous. And it kept going up while I was driving! The final straw is the constant issues with syncing. What is the point of having a smartwatch that cant even keep connected to your phone? I am very technologically savvy so I expect much better than this shoddy product for my money. Will be returning as soon as possible.",1

1,"I've had several fitbits. I lost two due to the original crappy wrist bands. The third one left marks on my arm and caused a rash. This version has a much better wrist band.One thing that has been consistently bad is the extremely slow and glitchy sync speed. It is unacceptable ti ne that I have to sync several times before my versa 2 will update. I love the sleep monitoring and the basic functions, but the battery charge takes far longer than it should. I put it on charge and picked it up three hours later to find it at 90%. That's not good enough.",3
1,"I am mainly writing a review of the sleep and weight tracking features as these are the main purpose I bought the device for. From my personal experience, the Fitbit Versa 2 seems to track sleep patterns quite well as it matches how I feel about my sleep. I think it's pretty accurate. It tracks sleep in 4 stages; awake, REM, light and deep. For each night, you would get a sleep rating from 1 to 100, with 100 being the best. I don't know how the Versa 2 determines the different stages, but it does seem to know when I start and finish sleeping accurately. The other feature I use is the weight tracking. I linked my Versa 2 to the RENPHO Bluetooth Body Fat Scale and it now tracks my weight easily and seamlessly with the REPHO app. Since I have had sleeping problems, it's great to see a graphical representation of my sleep patterns day over day so that I can better understand what's happening. I'm sure Fitbit has a disclaimer on the accuracy of the data, but from my experience it seems correct.",5
0,"I bought this in January 2020. I now have the white ""screen of death"", which means I can't view anything on the fitbit. It still tracks and I can view everything in the app, but it is essentially useless as a watch and viewing it on the actual watch screen. I've owned Fitbits for years and they only last 18 months. Then I go I buy the updated version, which again lasts 18 months. I'm through with Fitbits and am moving to Garmin.",1
1,"After buying smart watches after watches and returning them after they freeze or start tracking inaccurate readings I guess my gut feeling worked out.I've had probably 9 smart watches in the past 3 months. yes that's a lot The ones I've had a have been in the $350 pricing down to $250. They started off good then a few days in it's been freezing or ny heart rates been ok then been jumping up to the 220's. I'm a fitness fanatic and love these as it kinda kerps me on track .This Fitbit is very accurate, blood pressure monitor from Docs office said by heart beat was 62 , watch was reading 62.The screen is pretty big and great clear details and decent watch facesThe battery life last me 4 days to which I workout for 2 hours a day for 5 days. That's great compared to my others which lasted 2 days if I was lucky. Its easy to transfer music. in fact its pretty decent with everything . I'm happy I've got. Good watch at a decent price which isn't pulling at my pocket",5
1,"I am impressed by the Fitbit Versa 2. I have owned the Charge HR, the Charge HR2, and briefly the Charge HR3 (returned it, liked the HR2 better). I recently upgraded to the Versa 2. I like the larger display, with lots of watch faces to choose from, both free and paid. The heart rate sensor is greatly improved. During spin class I compared it to my Polar watch with chest strap, and it was within one beat. I was wearing it as instructed, up a little from my wrist. The HR or HR2 could never do that. Definitely worth the upgrade to me.",5
1,"I want to know what time it is when I want to know. My previous Fitbit HR I’d have to tap it to get the time and more often than not it wouldn’t come up. This one has a button, instant time! I’ll admit I’m still learning the different options but I love the battery life. I originally charged it on a Wednesday. The following Wednesday I had 12% when I charged it. The next Wednesday, it still had 25%. It also charges fast, a few hours, and the charger is much easier to use than the HR; best of all, it’s in my favorite color which wasn’t available any other place I checked.",5
1,"I opted for this over an Apple Watch, because all I really need is the fitness tracker - for the price, this thing is a much better choice. This is my third (?) Fitbit product, so I saw no need to change anyway, they've always worked well for me. This thing is great - it's sleek, fits well, and has great apps and software. I use it with the MyFitnessPal app on my iPhone with no issues at all. It does everything I need it to do, plus a few whistles & bells: text & call notification, AM alarms, can change out the watch face & wristbands - all great. I do wish that the battery life was a bit longer - or gave me more notice when it's running low. An additional charger would also be a great option, but definitely not a dealbreaker. I'd absolutely purchase this again. If you're looking for a very stylish, super-functional fitness tracker that won't break the bank, this is the one.",5

I was astonished and super happy. Good job Fitbit!",5
1,"I bought a Versa 2 for Christmas 2019. I have used it for the basics -- time, sleep tracking, and measuring my steps, walks and workouts. My Fitbit worked well for these functions and only needed recharging every 5 days or so, which was easy and convenient. The watch was priced reasonably at first, But Fitbit immediately tries to sell you their premium service, which helps you track and interpret the data that the watch provides. It's an nice upgrade but in a $200 tracker should have been included in the basic software package. So if you, like me, thought you were saving money off the price of an Apple Watch, this is why. It's like paying for an app and finding that you're missing the important features unless you subscribe to the upgrade.I bought the premium service and used it for a year before discontinuing it. It wasn't worth the ongoing price. The basic features I needed worked without it. At least, they worked while the watch was working.My main complaint is that the watch died -- twice. After six months, the watch simply went off the tracks. The screen whited out, and required constant re-syncing. After a week of this, it wouldn't sync at all and the screen was blank. Customer service walked me through a couple of steps and then said they'd have to replace the watch. Still under the one-year warranty, I got my second Versa 2 for free. It worked fine for another year, then the same thing exact thing happened. This time, with the watch beyond the one-year warranty, customer service advised that I'd have to buy a new one.Fitbit offered a discount on a new Fitbit, but after two bad experiences, I'm not buying another Fitbit. There seems to be a built-in obsolescence of about one year. This is too much money to spend on a watch/tracker that only lasts a year or so.",3
1,"Shipping was prompt. Packaging was adequate. Product was as described. Was happy with band size having following sizing instructions. Subsequently bought change out bands (4 pack silicone (white/red/black/navy blue; metal band - silver) compatible with fitbit versa 2 and these attached beautifully for accessorising. The app synced with the Samsung Health App without any problems. The display is bold and bright, the touch screen interface works well, even with protective case on (also bought separately, in two colours - clear and black - snaps on snugly, and removes easily to charge). Would recommend as a mid-range priced smart-watch, especially for tracking fitness goals.",5
1,"Bought this watch in 2019 and immediately had an issue with the screen not staying on or not turning on when it should with wrist rotation. Spoke with support and it was replaced with a refurbished one immediately which worked as expected for two years of everyday wear. I didn't swim with it much but did on occasion. Recently I wore it swimming and the face came off and the unit fizzled out and will not longer turn on. Spoke with fitbit support, it is out of warrenty and they offered a 35% discount on a new product. The new smart watch models are similarly priced to the Samsung active 2, and even with the discount price the Samsung product is cheaper. I have been meaning to try the Samsung OS and am taking this opportunity to switch.",3
1,"I got this as a replacement to the sense, that broke twice in about 15 months. Since it was not under warranty anymore, I needed a new Fitbit. I decided a slightly older model, as those seem more durable. This has every feature of the sense I really used: it tracks my sleep, heart rate, steps as well as has plenty of clockfaces. No problems in 3 weeks, it uses about 20% of it's battery a day (on dim and do not disturb) and has the ""find my phone"" feature which I use quite often too.From what I can tell, there's no point in paying for for a fancier model, this tracker is great.",5
0,This is my second Fitbit product to die before or a little after 1 year. The positives is the watch seemed to function well while it was working. It was hesitant at first due to the pricing however I was hoping that it would show it's value over time. Unfortunately that time was only a a year and 3 months. Noticed one day that the watch was getting really warm while wearing it on my wrist. After a while it got so hot I had to remove it. Lets just say it seem to take it's last breath at that moment. I paid over $200 for a watch that only worked for 1 year!! Guess I should have purchased the extended warranty but I was naïve in trusting the maker of the watch to product a high quality product... not so,2
0,I received the watch and and it connected and worked properly for one day. I contacted support and all they told me to do was reset the watch. I reset the watch and then it worked.... for only a day....again. I have used fitbit for a couple of years and my fitbit versa had the exact same problem. I thought the versa 2 would be able to connect for notifications. I have a google pixel 3. I cannot reset my watch every damn day to make it work. SUPER UNHAPPY.. I will be switching to garmin or apple,1
0,"Purchased this Fitbit Versa 2 the first week of January and I've had it about a month so far. I owned a Fitbit Versa special edition before this and loved it. But was excited when they came out with a product with speech-to-text and Amazon Alexa. Well worth the additional investment in my opinion. However, the heart rate monitor of the watch no longer works. Everything else functions properly and I have called your customer service line and troubleshooted with them. Going through the regular rigmarole of hard resetting and factory resetting the device to try and fix the problem. After which their only solution is for me to send them my watch and have them diagnose the problem in either fix or replace it. Total turnaround time for that is over two weeks. I understand that it takes time to figure out a problem. But I just bought this $150 watch and I don't feel like I need to wait 2 weeks to have a problem solved that shouldn't be happening at all. A simple swap out for a new device would be acceptable. But honestly I'm regretting buying this watch it all at this point and wish I would have gotten a different brand strictly because of their lack of willingness to just replace my defective product",1
0,"Bought this for my Dad for Christmas... he wanted a smart-watch. Well turns out this “watch” isn’t too smart. Dads phone was older and didn’t have a lot of memory, so we had a terrible time trying to install the software.. AND if you dont have the software installed, the watch doesn’t work. So it doesn’t even show you the time until it’s fully installed and setup. Wow. So it sat on his dresser until i got him a new phone. Once we had a different phone, the software installed and the watch worked.",1
1,"In 2012 I bought a Fitbit One. Just slip it in a pocket on the way to work and get the results each and every day, and check the overall results weekly, monthly, yearly as time goes by. Fine. But earlier this year (2021) ole Fitbit One finally bit the dust. What to do? Looked and looked and looked. Just another One-like Fitbit or go up a notch to one of the smartwatch trackers? Had misgivings, but finally decided on the Versa 2 (Versa 3 seemed ""too loaded"" with bells and whistles I didn't see how I could or would use). My experience? Well, it has been outstanding. Simply outstanding. I cannot praise the Fitbit Versa 2 highly enough. I won't go into all of its many benefits, save to comment on just 2 of them: 1. It provides what to me is in depth analysis of my sleep each night - which, given my schedule, I need and like to keep track of, and 2. You tell it the hours you are usually active each day, and during each of those hours, if you have not walked at least 250 steps (or whatever goal you tell it), then 10 minutes before the hour it will buzz your wrist so you know to get up and get moving. I sit, research and write all day long, and without the Versa, I would maintain that status the entire work day; but not with the Versa 2. Finally, I had two main concerns when I bought the Versa 2: 1. If I wear it all the time, then what about charging (My Experience: Put it in its charger that came with it when I head to the shower before going to work each morning, and it's 100% when I walk out the door 20 minutes later - from being down to 85% overnight); and 2. Can the vast majority of its features and benefits be accessed without joining the premium subscription you can get from Fitbit with each of its devices - because I absolutely would not fall for that (My Experience: I love it just as it comes and see no real use for me to go premium subscription). There's just one feature it offers that I have not tried but definitely want to: the ""Relax"" feature. But I'm just too busy. Sad. Great Product! You'll definitely enjoy it, and pay a lot more attention to how active you're being and how much sleep and the quality of the sleep you're getting.",5
1,This is so a great smartwatch when it does work. It has so many features that's useable but man they need to fix the syncing issues. Once it's stop syncing it's so hard to reconnect again. It's very frustrating. I hoping they fixed this issues in Versa 3 if not than it's not worth the purchase.,3
0,"Here is my little story with the Fitbit. I bought the 1st Generation Fitbit Versa in 2018. The experience was lackluster to say the least. Over the year I had to do factory resets and the like about once or twice a month. A pain mind you but, not game breaking. It was the 1st generation after all so you need to expect such quirks. Companies usually rush any tech out these days in order to compete so we are all beta-testers in a sense anyway.However, two weeks after the one year warranty ran out the Versa became a brick. Just refused to work. I went through all the steps with tech support and they decided I needed a new one but, since the warranty ran out they would only give me a 20% discount on the new Versa 2 that came out. It was right before Black Friday so I thought I would wait and see if any better sales came about. I did like the Versa, I liked the idea of what it could do so I wanted to, really wanted to like the product.November comes and Eureka!! there is great sales on the Fitbit Versa 2 and I buy one. Thinking, ""Ok, this is the 2nd generation they worked out all the bugs."" Yes, I fell into the trap. In January, Fitbit releases a patch that bricks a lot of the Versa 2 models. Looking at the forums I was reading hundreds of very unhappy people. Calling tech support they tried to fix it but, in the end just sent me a new one. Overall not a bad experience.Now, here I sit today, almost five months after my replacement. I have to either force stop my app and restart it, or completely shut off the phone and watch and hope it re sync's, or do a complete factory reset almost everyday. At least three times a week. This little watch has become more of a pain than any tech I own. I loved the idea of this watch and really, really wanted to like it but, it seems we, as customers, are still in the ""beta"" testing phase.I am going to give up on most of the watches capabilities with the app and just wear it as a semi-smart watch. It still give steps and heart rate and tells the time but, it will only sync if ""IT"" decides it wants to. I imagine it will finally just stop syncing one day and slowly fade away. I definitely won't be buying the 3rd generation if there is one. When the watch finally dies it will be off to a different brand.",2
1,"I love this watch. I use it a lot for workouts as well as casual use (checking the weather, my steps). It does have other apps where you can download games, news, workout training, etc, but these are features I dont use (I'd rather use my phone for that). It documents my workout on a treadmill, if I'm jogging, if I'm doing weights, and when I do yoga. Really diverse and useful. I charge it every 3-4 days and it charges really quick (it can be on 10% and will go to 100% in an hour and some change).The screen is very durable. I didn't buy a protective case for it (there are products out there) so it did get small scratches. I dont mind and you cant even tell unless you are staring into it with direct light on it. The wrist band does stick to my skin when I sweat which bothers but I got use to adjusting it rather than complain.The app is also useful. It has a community build on seeing the success of strangers, health tips, and workout tips. On it, I can input my water intake, track my food intake and check my sleeping pattern. With the sleeping pattern, you can also see the times you were in REM or having a light sleep (which is cool).I'm always sceptical when I purchase a product that's costly, but i do think it's worth it if fitness is what you are going for. It reminds me when I haven't made my steps for the hour and congratulations when I meet milestones. I'm constantly reminded to be active so I love the persuasion.",5
0,"This is my second Fitbit. The first lasted about 3 years, but this one is malfunctioning and I've only had it since June 2021. I noticed a week ago, that my steps seemed off. Then the watch would come on at night (I had it set to stay dark at night). Now it will not connect to my phone, and is stuck in ""exercise"" mode.Very disappointed. I tried to connect through the ""tech support"" option on my order purchase page, but instead was directed to an agent who promptly told me this item is not eligible for return.",1
0,"Worst product and no option to replace, return, or obtain support from the manufacturer. The sleep tracker is a flat out lie - it does not work and has never worked. It doesn't not notify of any messages at all. It can not detect when you're are exercising. Ultimately you can do the same stuff with a heart rate and step tracker linked to a decent fitness app. I called for FitBit for support and they told me to contact Amazon to return and then put me on hold for 10 minutes to come back and say to turn it off and back on. So disappointed. If you go to the Fitbit Community forum you will see a flood of issues that people have discussed - all without resolutions.",1
1,Needed to replace my Charge 4. Couldn’t decide between the charge five or the versa two. After reading all the reviews still felt like it was a tossup. I went with the Versa 2 and i’m really glad I did. You can see when you’re getting a call or text but you can’t respond. That doesn’t matter to me but it’s kind of nice to have the notification. Battery life is about three days and I like the app because I already knew how to use it. I really like that you can see so much on watch face without being to small or busy. Overall I’m really satisfied. Hopefully this will help someone trying to make a decision.,5
0,"This was my 2nd Fitbit, my first one didn't do enough. This Versa 2 worked for just over a year (out of warranty of course) and then the back button stopped working, and it is stuck permanently on a setup screen. I read all the ""to do"" and nothing has worked. Looking at another brand now.",1
0,"I've had 2 Versas. I had the original until the screen went black a week outside the warranty. Then I bought this device, and the heart rate monitor broke a week outside the warranty too. Before you buy, understand that Versa's historically have problems with the software on the heart rate monitor. Without a heart rate monitor you can't take advantage of their sleep tracking, zone workout minutes, blood oxygen levels, or accurate calorie counting. It essentially becomes a glorified step counter.I've tried giving the company the benefit of doubt because their product interface and features are great. However, I've had two Fitbits break within a week of their warranty expiring. Both times the issue was with the software. When searching forums for answers, Fitbit's answer is always that they're aware of the issue and actively working to fix it. That was over 4 years ago. They're being intentionally negligent by either not fixing the devices, or not pulling them from the market. Please don't buy their products. On every forum I've read, Fitbit is only willing to go so far for it's faulty products and make customers pay endlessly for new devices. They may replace your original Fitbit, but they rarely replace their replacement when it breaks. At the end of the day you're really paying for a $150+ annual subscription instead of a lasting product.",1
0,"The sleep monitoring doesn't break down the entire nights sleep. Often I wake at 2-3 in the morning and then go back to sleep. It records these as separate events AND in order to record details of sleep, it needs three hours or it won't give any details, so if you sleep for 2 hours 59 minutes, you can't see REM, deep, etc.The Saturation displayed is dead wrong! When calling the company they admit; ""it is not a medical device therefore only an estimation"" I registered 93% with the new clock face app and 97% at the doctors office. If anyone is going to try and use this for clinical considerations don't!",2
0,"Two original models each lasted me less than 1-1/2 years, then the versa2 failed in less than 5 months!Their customer service SUCKS!!!They want me to send it in first, wait 5-10 business days (read 2 weeks), then they'll give me information about receiving a replacement, probably another week!

This is the second Fitbit that broke and was not covered under warrenty.. would not cover HR2 band.Called customer service, was not impressed with his service. Now waiting for warrenty email.

0,"I am really mad. I am a fitbit premium member and I have had fitbit's since 2007 but I am currently being given a real run-around. One Fitbit customer support agent said that as long as I was within my 30 day window I could purchase the plan, even if I had dismissed the notification (because I was busy working out...and I figured I had 30 days). Another has just told me via e-mail that if dismissed it 3 times then that's it - I can no longer get the protection plan...even though I am still in my 30 days window. No idea who is telling the truth here - but it should not be that hard to get the protection plan - on their website it even says ""within 30 days"" so does that make it false advertising? It doesn't say anywhere that you HAVE to do it through the app... and that you only have 3 dismissals before it's gone forever.Bottom line is - it's a good product but their customer service is freaking terrible!",1
0,"The wife received it as a gift, returning it for later models, like the model 3. Noticed it was impossible to get any notifications to get through. Settings, permissions, battery optimizations, and all settings are correct. After some googling, I discovered it's not compatible with the latest Android versions and Fitbit will not be offering forward compatibility on the Versa 2, only the 3. From what I saw from the interface trying to get it to work, the screen is very limited and primarily setup for fitness enthusiasts, not that suitable for business use. I'd recommend a watch with a good display, good processor, and good battery life that uses the WearOS Android OS. This will ensure forward compatibility and functionality.",1
1,"Ordered the Versa 2 for my wife. Her Fitbit has been reporting a rather high resting heart rate and appears to not be counting many steps, either. After poking fun at her for being a very stressed person per the monitor, I started questioning its accuracy when it regularly hit 140+ BPM while doing mundane tasks and physically confirming her heartrate was much lower.I decided to test this. I use a Fitbit Ionic, which is worn on my left wrist. I strapped the Versa 2 onto my right wrist. Turns out the Versa 2 is reading quite a bit higher than it should, otherwise I have some interesting health issues. Rebooted the Versa 2. Issue persisted. Factory reset the Versa 2. Issue persisted. Requested a replacement.Due to how many of these are sold, it's hard to not come across a faulty piece of hardware here and there. Other than this one's inaccurate monitors, it's a great product that includes several helpful features for fitness and health tracking.",4

Is there anyone out there that can help me with the situation.

I contracted Fitbit while they were very nice they too were unable to figure out what's wrong with my Fitbit. So I spent $200.00 on a watch that does nothing but tell time and count my steps. I wanted a refund but was told by Fitbit they can't assist me any refunds. I bought the watch in September and have been going back and forth with Fitbit since then. Im very disappointed",1
1,"So I'm not getting any younger and I thought this would help me get some healthy habits and get in shape. At first I just used it as a pedometer but now that I've had it for a couple of months, I'm starting to use some of the other features. Besides the pedometer, it has a list of activities that you can track, from walking and running, you can track HIIT, swimming (it claims to be waterproof, but I'm not willing to take the risk of getting it wet), workouts, even yoga and martial arts. You can customize your list if there aren't activities listed. You can track diet, calories, weight goals, water intake, and sleep. I haven't been able to get the sleep tracking to be accurate. Operation takes some getting used to as it is not as intuitive as you might think. It has GPS tracking (using your phone) and even has Alexa. Overall I'm happy with my purchase and have managed to loose 37 lbs!",4
1,"I love this watch! I really do except I feel the steps counted can be inaccurate. This is my first smartwatch and there have been some inaccuracies that I have noticed that don't bother me too much but may really peeve other people! The activities also may come across as something different too. For example, when I mow the lawn, it will read it as swimming and biking is just a walk. It doesn't tend to state any activities besides walking and swimming lol. Other than that, the battery life is great and logs heartrate and calories burned fantastically. It is comfy to wear and has great resilience to being knocked. ( I stay very active, work on lots of cars and there are no scratches 7 months in with no extra cover for it.) It does the job for me and keeps me from digging in my pocket or purse for the time as well as keeping me active.",4

I am hoping for a favorable outcome from Fitbit. If they replace this watch, I will add to my review. If not, I will not be buying a Fitbit watch the next time. I will look for something else.",2
1,"Meh. I also have an Inspire HR that is not waterproof, as advertised, but I like it better than this watch. I am not part of the population that like something the size of my smart phone strapped to my wrist. I think we’re all caught up in the technology on the wrist idea, but I miss my real watch more with this device that I did with the Inspire. I have no idea if this is supposed to be waterproof, but I am extremely doubtful given their previous track record and short period of support.I’d like to use my Inspire and the Versa2 interchangeably, since the Inspire can be put into a little clip that can be hidden when I’m dressed up. However, unlike my previous Fitbits, it’s either/or, which has rendered the Inspire useless, unless I give my daughter the Versa2. The apps are the same as the Inspire, unless you want to pay.The screen color is crisp and beautiful and there are some interesting free watch faces, but the size is more off-putting than I thought it would be.",4
1,"Very nice Fitbit with a large face so I can see what I’m reading. However, The alarm goes off to soon and not at all for time set. That’s a disappointment, but not a big problem. I’m am dissatisfied with the fact I can’t contact the vender and ask for the difference in price that came about the day after I purchased the Fitbit. Price when I bought it was $179.99 and the next day it was $149.99. I was going to return it and buy it at the lower price but I was denied purchase because they only sell one item to one buyer. Otherwise, I think it’s a great item and look forward to using it all the the time.",5
0,"After 2 months, something changed that is probably linked to a product update pushed down from Fitbit. Erratic behavior started and the battery would lose charge rapidly. I followed all the recommendations from Fitbit product support, to no avial. Then I tried the Fitbit Community and was shocked at what I read. MANY people are having the same problems after each May/June product updates. Even more shocking is the apparent lack of caring or support from Fitbit when confronted with these problems. I then tried to chat with an agent and got a ""drone"" who would only quote the return policy which they limit to 45 days! No solution offered, they are terrible!",1

0,I really liked the features of this watch and it connected with most of my apps ok but I went to put my watch on the other day and face of it just separated from the base. It is literally hanging on by a thread. I read some reviews online for this issue and it seems that FitBit has had the same problem with all versions of this watch and have done nothing about it. I bought insurance for the watch but wonder if it is even worth my time to get another one only to have it do the same thing in a few months?The strangest part about all this is that the watch is still working but it is hanging off of the base and most likely will completely separate if I continue to wear it. It is a shame,2

Can wear it and walk for half an hour and it will count about 5 steps. Or go periods where it doesn't count at all.So frustrating as I'm trying to meet a goal each day.",1

I love having a fitness tracker to keep me motivated and for me, being able to match my watch to my outfit for the day is important. Since I do a lot of gardening, I have no fingernails and it’s very hard to change the band. I didn’t get the Versa 3 because I know that the gps isn’t that great with Fitbit, but I wish I had now just because of this issue.I do love that I am able to see the time without my glasses - it’s big and very easy to read. I’ve had my Versa 2 for less than a week and the step count seems to be right on - if I run 3 miles, I get an additional 6000 steps, which is about what I got from my Apple Watch.The challenges with friends is a feature that keeps me motivated to go a bit further.It’s a nice looking watch, but I’ve almost thought about returning and going up to a Versa 3 just because of the band issue.",3

I'm delighted with the Versa 2. It provides so much more information (and encouragement to keep going!) It says I'm in Excellent cardio health, it gives me my resting heartbeat, I can see what my BPM are when I'm exercising. It shows the different stages of sleep (in the app.) I changed out the watch face to show steps taken, time, BPM, weather, date. I like it shows floors climbed. I like the better feedback on how my body is responding to exercise. I swim and it was accurate on the number of laps. There is a lot of information. So why have just a watch when you can have this!",5

I tried one last time and they said to do a few thing and when that didn't work they said do a factory reset on the Versa 2. I did that and then it worked for all of 2 DAYS and then it stopped working. I contacted the support line and they said that the warrantee is only good for 1 year and ""IF"" i had purchased the extended warrantee then it would have extended the warrantee another year but I don't recall having that option when I got. I know have a ""Steps"" tracker and not the fully functional Fitbit that I purchased..

My issue across the board has been with syncing and skin irritations. The skin irritations from both charge versions stemmed from the band. Versa2 skin irritation stemmed from the charge mechanism on backside of watch as perfect circle rash formed on top of wrist. Tons of people complain about the skin irritations from version to version but the issue is never addressed. When emailing fitbit, they give you cleaning tips and offer refund if within timeframe. I've tried one galaxy fitness watch and hated the app...I'm biased to fitbit I guess. I want to look into apple watch but friends warn me of daily charging and not being able to track sleep because it's the perfect time to charge.

The ONLY thing I don't care for is I purchased the cover to protect it and cannot charge it while the sleeve is on it. I also like the design of the Apple watch bands better than the buckle type.

Not much better than the older Versa.One big negative is the always on display is annoying at night in bed.Overall, not really impressed.",2
0,"I had this watch for less than 6 months and it quit tracking my steps, heart rate etc. it would just freeze up. What’s worse is Fitbit’s customer service required it to be shipped back before they could send me a replacement. It has been over 2 weeks and they claim to have not received it yet. If you buy one of these please buy the extra warranty. Do what you can to avoid having to deal with their customer service.As far as fitness tracking I prefer this over Apple. But for longevity look elsewhere.",1
1,"Got this one to replace a previous model of Fitbit. Very nice. Large display. Fits great. Easy to change bands. Waterproof (for my purposes). I wear it during my aquatic physical therapy to maintain tracking of my activity level. No problems.My only issue is with the Sleep Tracker. On me, it doesn't appear very accurate. Primarily due to my own sleep patterns. I'm a restless sleeper who moves quite a bit. In order to read the various levels of sleep, the unit requires your arm to be at rest for a period of time to register you are asleep. Unfortunately, with my flailing around, my arm isn't at rest for the required time frame.",5
0,"2 stars because i did Like my fitbit until fitbit provided an update for the Versa 2 that rendered it useless. Now i have a watch that isnt smart and just tells time. Today i would rate it 0 stars. My Versa 2 had stopped working at 1 year of use after accepting an update that made the heart monitor stop working. Without the heart monitor this watch cant track heart rate or sleep. Now i have 2 monitor categories that are blank and provide no data. Better yet i have told fitbit support about the issue, but this has fallen on deaf ears. I havent even been given any response back regarding the update issue. Not to mention many others on fitbit's own forums have experienced similiar problems after an update, so i was not the only one. Thats terrible support to leave customers in the dark after providing an update that kill features on the device. The heart rate and sleep tracking were the most attractive features of the device. I decided to buy the expensive fitbit device when i should have purchased a knockoff. To me, fitbit is no better than the knockoff brands these days as even their support has stopped working. Other devices are a fraction of the cost compared to fitbit. Dont give Fitbit your business.",2
0,"This vera worked great but then began having touch response issues a couple moths ago then today, 10 months later it fell apart on my wrist in the tub and it's water proof socan track swimming but this happed in the bath. The whole face plate popped off and was hanging by wires, I am shocked I didn't get shocked! It's completely dead and will not turn on. I have not abused it in anyway and there is no reason for it to fall apart other than its defective. I am bummed I spent so much on poorly made item. My Childs $35 fitness tracker does everything that the Fitbit versa did and is older than my fit bit that just broke. Disappointed and won't be purchasing again, not worth the price.",1
1,"This Versa 2 is an upgrade from an Alta that would no longer hold a charge for more than a few hours. I really love all the ""extras"" that come with this Fitbit. I am an aging senior citizen and it motivates, prompts, and encourages me to keep moving, and hit my goals. The face is very easy to read and move around on, even with the screen protector I purchased to protect it. I also like the fact that I can monitor my heart rate, and I especially like the sleep tracking. The battery life is great and charges quickly.",5
0,"I loved my Fitbit Versa 2 right up to the moment my husband's Versa 2 battery died after 16 months of use. After contacting Customer Support, we were told Fitbit batteries cannot be replaced nor repaired which means the watch is now useless. All we got was ""sorry"" from the CS rep. After doing some research on the watch and battery, I discovered the short life of the battery was a common problem. When my battery dies, I can assure you I will put my money into a watch where the battery can be replaced and fixed if necessary.",2
0,"This product worked fine with my previous phone at first. At about 5 to 6 months old, It randomly stopped uploading to the app. It would tell me to put the digits in to connect and then would fail to connect. The date won't update because of this and I can't keep track of anything for my progress for my nutritionist because of this. I did all troubleshooting and nothing worked. Ended up purchasing a new phone and the same thing happened. Wrote to the company about the situation and how frustrated I was and have heard absolutely nothing in over a month from them!! Ive bought 2 other Fitbit products in the past but I will never buy another one. Still no response from c.s and its now a year. 6 mo of not using it. Waste of money",2
0,It started out great but now after a month or so it’s starting to get buggy. Vibrates for no reason and it’s starting to freeze often. Reboot only to get it started again but 3 times a day is a little ridiculous. Fit bit better get there crap together on this one and get these issues fixed in there next updates.,1
1,"I liked the encouragement, deep breathing, HR was near accurate, I enjoyed learning better sleep patterns. Love the vibration to awake. I pretty much enjoyed all around. Unfortunately, it just stop working in Feb 2020 seem just in timing I really was applying a healthy lifestyle. Granted it was my 1st wearable fitness tracker. I say this watch was worth almost all it cost except now since just died. I never wore it in the showering & I even purchase covers to keep in conditions. Just saddens me I can not trust to buy another one. I have tried writing to seller & got no response. I understand something are not always perfect. It going take a lot trust before I purchase a replacement. So I am reading, watching & hoping betterment to come.",5
0,"Heart rate (HR) is not accurate. Mostly way lower than when I counted with my carotid artery as well as my polar chest strap. Sleep data is clearly wrong as evidenced by I was sleeping on my couch, turned on the TV, was wide awake, but it showed that I was asleep 15 min longer than I was. I do have a somewhat thin wrist, but I am not tiny. 5'6"" and 130 lbs. I do think the HR is probably more accurate for people who are slightly overweight. I LOVE the fact that the battery lasts about 3 days. The features are great. I would LOVE this if the HR were accurate!",2
1,"I love this thing! I bought it as a way to control my music while I teach dance classes. Connects easily to my apple ipod and can pause, play, or skip between tracks in a playlist without having to run back and forth to the stereo. I've really warmed up to it's intended purpose and love the sleep tracking feature, as well as the step counting and ability to track my heart rate during classes. The ability to set reminders and make lists with Alexa is also a huge bonus! Less than a year in, my display got a row of dead pixels, and fitbit sent me a replacement right away when I spoke to customer service! I'm super impressed!",5
0,"I got this Fitbit Versa 2 last year as a gift from my family when it came out. I was really excited to use it because I work the night shift as a nurse. I was looking forward to using the timer function to set timers so I can return to the patients' rooms before the IV pumps go off and wake my patients up. I had an Android phone at the time and the smartwatch worked synched really well with it. My problem occurred when 2 weeks ago, my Fitbit started flashing that it was low battery even though I made sure it was fully charged before I left for work. I didn't think much of it and I figured that it will charge once I plug it in. However, the watch did not turn on. I thought it was my charging cable so I ordered new ones and even switched out the wall outlet adapter. Still, it didn't turn on. I tried to press the side button but only the indicator of low battery flashed on. Since it seemed like a manufacturer defect, I called Fitbit customer service to resolve the issues. The representative on the phone was not helpful. She told me to clean the back of the watch, which is already clean and has no dust trapped in it. I followed all her suggestions, including switching out the cables and plugs, all things I had attempted. She then proceeded to tell me it could be my outlet that's the problem, however, that logic doesn't make sense because other electrical products have no problem being charged using the same outlet. I asked if I could send the smartwatch back to the company so it could be checked. She did not respond and proceed to say that I will get an email regarding the warranty, but I questioned if I would be covered considering the product died a month after the warranty. She didn't answer me. Instead, she stated that my case had to be reviewed first. Later, I just received an email stating that my watch is no longer under warranty but they will offer a 35% coupon off any of the products. I do not want another product. I just want the one I had fixed. I understand if I accidentally dropped it and broke it and it's not under warranty anymore. But this product was defective! I only use it mostly for work and I remove it before I shower. So I don't understand how a $200 product can only last a year. I recommend you look elsewhere if you want a product that actually stands the test of time. I don't normally write reviews but I want to save you the money so here it is.",1
1,"So I have had this watch since Saturday. It was cool at first, everything I wanted.... but now I have figured out that there are a few issues.#1 the step count is off by hundreds, like sitting down for an hour can give me 800 steps.... I looked it up and people have suggest resetting it back to factory settings. I did that, didn't work.The main reason I bought this watch, is because it had the ability to track steps, and it had the ability to add music to it. Apparently I made a wrong choice.UPDATE 3/11/2020. So after having this for a few months, I am having to go ahead and send it back. It started causing blisters on my wrist after about 3wks of wearing it. I tried switching between different types of bands, ... but nothing helped. My wrist is still peeling from the blisters and I haven't wore the watch since January. I've already contacted Fitbit. They are super helpful, and are allowing me to send it back.",3
1,"Bought this fitbit in May 2021 - I wear it daily and am mostly sedentary with walking and other casual exercise - no crazy, dirty, dangerous working conditions here! Within 2 months the band had broken at the pin, I purchased another fitbit brand band. 2 months later and it was shearing off at the pin - I noticed it before it broke through entirely and had the fit bit on my desk, I knocked it off the desk, fell on the carpeted floor at work and the screen shattered(!!). 4 months old, 2 broken bands and one broken screen and I don't even do any sort of sports or activities that might damage it! App was great, sleep tracking was great, its unfortunate the fitbit itself just isn't well made.",3
1,"I bought this smart watch to replace my fitbit charge 2. I am totally satisfied - there's more exercise options and I get a daily reading of my blood oxygen level. It provides a weather update, alarm and tools for healthy eating and staying fit.I highly recommended it!",4
1,"Got this for a great price to replace my old Fitbit. I love the large size of the face, however, after wearing it only a week, I noticed a scratch on the face. I had to get a 3 pack of covers, which now protect it. I love the sleep tracking and have no trouble viewing things online. I also can see incoming phone calls and read texts. I haven't used many of the extras, but I don't need them. I need to remove the cover to charge it, but it charges quickly. Overall I am very happy with this Versa.",5
0,"I'm so disappointed!! I Received my first Fitbit Versa 2 Special Edition, and it didn't work, so I sent it back. I actually suspected that it may have been opened before, because there was a different kind of tape on the box. I received the identical replacement, which looked like it was factory packaged. After all the set up, I noticed that the heart rate monitor didn't work at all, and therefore, neither did the sleep monitor function. I thought maybe it would correct, or I had the settings wrong, but no...it doesn't even light up. Also, the messaging notifications were inconsistent. I had a Fitbit Blaze before this, but after a couple of years, it gave up. I was excited to upgrade to a newer Fitbit model. I'm not sure whether I should give up on Fitbit all together. I like all the functions when they work. Ugh!!!",1
0,"I have been using Fitbit for many years. Started with the Fitbit One. It was great. I had to replace three times apparently wearing out. I switched to Fitbit Versa.I had many problems. The watch would reset itself to different times, it would lock up, it would cause me to reconnect (lately) everyday.Today was too much. The face of the watch came loose and was just hanging there. Now it is no longer water resistant.I am finished with Fitbit.I paid over $200 for this watch. I do not believe it was worth $100 a year.As stated I will not buy another Fitbit product.",2
1,"OK, if you want the low down here it goes... the Versa 2premium is premium because of the services you get {3 month trial from activation) other than that it's the Versa 2... with a cloth watch band.NOW, as for me I wanted the premium so I could see the services offered... free of course...they offer videos of workouts and a detailed sheet of your stats but only after a month of use, so as for extras, the pandora... extra $, the Spotify Xtra $ deezer Xtra $ so so far I'm not a fan but I'll use the free stuff before they're gone. Versa 2 price point fits the watch which is perfect all of the bells and whistles,premium is more expensive and is so just for services, and the band. This watch is spot on though and it is very accurate sleep, steps, activities, workouts, hr, and it has Alexa... but so does the Versa 2....so point made unless you're avid in wanting to subscribe to other services get the Versa 2. I love the watch though.in 3 months I'm have the Versa 2 when my trial runs out.",5
1,"I really wanted a different smartwatch but didn't want to shell out hundreds for it. Well folks, you get what you pay for and now I'm returning this watch.It's not awful. In fact, there's a lot I like about it. It's cute, feels nice, has some cool features...and that's about it. The app is the least intuitive thing I have ever used. I'm pretty tech savvy, and it should not have taken me that long to set it up. App is cluttered and confusing, and nothing works on the first try. Just setting up my wifi failed three times. What? I still can't get Spotify to connect properly. Fitbit pay only supports a handful of banks, none of which I use, so now that feature is useless to me (which is most of the reason why I opted for the Versa2 rather than the lite). And my steps are way off. It was literally counting while I was sitting on the couch.All in all, it's a pretty mediocre product for $160. I'll spend the extra hundred for the newer version of what I already own, because I know it works.",3
0,"I realized that the bulkiness on my wrist caught on to almost everything, making it hard to put my hand in my own pocket. I would snag on small things at work mainly. But the two biggest annoyances I found is how inaccurate the calorie counter is, and how many steps it misses. I noticed a few times that I wouldn't put the watch on until I went to work in the evening and the calories counter would be at zero, as it should be. The second I put it on it calculates some number of base caloric consumption and grows out that I've already now burned 1400 calories. I've looked at my Fitbit profile and found nothing to explain why it was so high. The second, bigger reason I have no use for this, is that it doesn't track the steps I take when I'm holding a water bottle in the same hand as the watch. In fact, it doesn't count a step if my arm doesn't make the entire swinging motion forward and back with each step I take. I feel like the motion sensor should be able to pick up all directions of steps.",2
0,"When unboxing and pairing the fitbit and pairing to the phone, I was asked for a credit card to pay an extra $9.99/mo. At first, it wasn't clear what that was for. This watch was was already expensive, why is the phone app not included in the purchase price? I initially declined the extra fees.When using the app to view reports from the watch, nearly every page displays an ad demanding you to pay $9.99 to access the full features of that page within the app. I purchased this specifically for sleep tracking. The sleep tracking page in the app conceals much of the data they're collecting on you without paying a monthly fee. And if you don't want to pay the fee, prepare to be nagged about it constantly while using the app. I had to give in and pay the hidden tax to access the features I bought the watch for. Amazon should go ahead and list the purchase price as $250+$9.99/moEven though I'm already paying $9.99/mo, fitbit.com displays irritating pop-up banner ads if you try to view your reports there. Great. I love paying to see ads.One of the selling features of this watch is a customizable watch face. Fitbit helpfully doesn't provide these for you. They allow ""the community"" to make all the watch faces. 99% of them are awful, and were assembled by somebody with no visual design skills as a hobby project. To find a stylish watch face, that doesn't look silly or ugly, requires scrolling through pages and pages of ""Baby's first watch-face"" style projects.After a lot of work, I found a few watch faces I liked. I only had to pay $3-5 to download them. That's $3-5 EACH.Now about the poor sleep tracking. It works great. As long as I strap the watch to my wrist much tighter than is comfortable. As long as the watch band is digging into your skin, and the watch cannot move at all on your wrist, the sleep tracking features are pretty slick. I wake up with my wrist hurting, but I can ask the app how my sleep was. If I wear the watch normally, it's possible for the sensor on the watch to lose contact with my skin for some periods of the night. Then the app report says it's not able to provide good information on that night's sleep, and to wear the watch tighter. And also, please pay an extra $9.99/mo while you're at it.If I want to check the time, on my watch, I have to press the button first. The raise to wake feature usually doesn't work. Except when it's not supposed to. There is a feature to leave the watch screen on 24/7, but it drains the little battery rather quickly, and it doesn't even show your preferred watch face! Want to see the watch face you selected? Go ahead and press the button.As soon as I can replace this device with a better sleep tracker, I'm going to give it as a gift to somebody I don't like very much.",1
0,"I am so disappointed. The only thing that this watch is good at doing consistently is telling the time. I synced it to my phone for replying to text messages and it only worked good for a week. It won't stay hooked up to Bluetooth either. As for refreshing, well..let's just say that today is 1/18/22 and I am still syncing from 1/6/22. Since it won't sync, I can't review my data therefore making this watch furthermore WORTHLESS!! I have troubleshooter and everything. Nothing works. What a waste of time and money.",2
1,"I bought the Firbit Versa 2 to replace another model that died after about a year. I like the Versa 2: the dial is large and easy to read, the various things it tracks are interesting, and I like the phone app. The drawbacks are 1) the blood oxygen tracking is wildly inaccurate, 2) the strap keeper loosens up over time and doesn't hold the strap on, 3) the battery life is very short, and 4) the watch is starting to fail after only 15 months. The overall short life span is the biggest drawback to these devices.",4
1,set up for this fit bit is really frustrating… I had to set up and then factory reset it to set it up again.. The spotify app is not an app it is just a controller on the fit bit you must 1st open the app on your phone and start playing a song in order for the spotify controller to work on the fit bit otherwise you get a Bluetooth connection error message every time… As well as in the video it makes it look like you can control smart devices with the Alexa function as you can see in the video the lady says turn on my ACI just got off the phone with Amazon and you can not control your devices with this fit bit you can basically just ask Alexa questions for general purposes and your calendar and you're fit bit app… definitely not as advertised Well either increase or decrease rating after a month of usage,3
1,Bought this on sale to replace a charge 3 that I got tired of trying to read. Accuracy is similar. These aren't medical grade devices but they are reasonably close on steps and heart rate. The screen is bright and easy to read with an ample amount of free watch faces. I really like being able to hang up on unknown callers and scammers from the watch face. The band is fine so long as you don't have to change it and was one of the reasons I decided against the versa 3. I hated that type of band on a watch I used to have. The only thing I worry about is the longevity of the watch as I see many reviewers having trouble about a year of use. Hopefully that won't be an issue and so far I am satisfied with my purchase.,4
1,I like my Fitbit Versa 2I had the charge 2 before.I would have given this 5 stars but the band burned my wrist and it scared me.I switched it to my right hand until I healed.I bought a different band and it’s been better but I shouldn’t have had to spend money on a new band when I paid enough for this device.I think they need to do something about those bands.I never had that problem with the charge 2 and I realized I only used the original band for a few days because it was to big and I bought a different one.I keep my Fitbit clean cuz I think it’s gross if you don’t. I’m still trying to figure out why that happened.,3
1,"my boyfriend has had this watch 1 year, he loved it. Recently the front kept popping off like the glue that holds it together NO longer worked. He didn't tell me the 1st few times he just pressed it back on. its beyond ""self"" fixing. its not in any working condition and I've had the hardest time trying to locate customer service/returns/repairs with Fitbit as I bought it through amazon. I don't have an order #. Seems odd a watch barely lasts a year. this is the 2nd time he has had a problem usually he just buys another watch but I think there should be a better answer. I personally have an Apple Watch so I don't understand what the quality of a Fitbit really is, I just know we buy a lot of fit bits and I'm still on the same Apple Watch!",3
0,This last Fitbit watch (Versa 2) didn't even last 2 years! The entire face came off! Just fell off! I never wore it in the water swimming or even just dipping in a pool. Always removed it before showering. I just wore the watch daily! This is the last time I will purchase a Fitbit. Not one of the 4 watches I have purchased has lasted longer than 2 years. Fitbit does not make them right even when they told me one of the watches was defective! Only gave me a discount to get a new one. Luckily this time I purchased Asurion protection plan and immediately received a full credit. I love the concept of these watches and am very active and enjoy knowing my daily stats. Why can't Fitbit stand behind their products and have better customer service?,1
1,"I have this already and I got my son ( 16 years old) and he finds it very helpful. We both like the steps tracking, heart rate and notifications for apps. But the important part is the sleep monitoring. We both have sleep issues and it's a good tool to track it, along with the other things ( your resting heart rate, breaths per min when sleeping, temperaturewhen sleeping your SpO2 rate too) they are definitely not anything for diagnostic but something to watch. Highly recommend this product",5
0,"I came from a Garmin that I thought was ultimately great but didn't sync with my Fitbit Scale. I thought it'd be great having a single app for all my data so I made the switch when the Garmin broke. Having a side by side, I now know that the battery on this is sub-par. I could charge the Garmin while in the shower and never lose battery. This, however, even when charging during showers, I still need to do a full charge every week or so. I also found that it's not responsive enough to flipping so that I can see the time, so I've resorted to using the always on feature which worsens the battery issue. The Alexa integration was also very disappointing. It requires the phone's bluetooth, doesn't hear well, often doesn't connect, and is nowhere near the capability I might expect from a normal Dot or Show (given the screen). Lastly, the alerts are all screwy. It will keep telling me I have a phone call when I've already answered it, and alerts will disappear before I can even see what they were. Altogether, I'm very disappointed. I use it almost entirely as a time-keeping device rather than a smart watch but in this case I need to keep charging it. Might as well go back to an 80s watch and twist-power it.",2
1,"After getting this I have become more active in my daily life. I mainly use the step counter and it motivates me to get at least to the goal of 250 steps an hour. I usually exceed that goal but at least if I am stuck behind my desk it reminds me. Which anyone who does have a desk position, knows how you can lose track of time and the next time you look at a clock an hour and half has gone by. I believe this is for two different type of people. The ones who need to get more active (me) and the ones who want to keep track of their daily progress either just with their daily routine or an exercise program. Because you don't realize how far you may walk for something you do every day, until you have something to track it. But I use the goal of 10,000 steps a day which then gives me a challenge to get to. And as a side note, I have rather large wrist's (Approx. 9.5"") so I had bought the third party band extender and was surprised when I did not have to use the extender because the larger band that is supplied with the Fitbit was able to fit comfortably. Everyone has there own tastes and sure a pedometer would be okay to count my steps. But it never hurts to know your heart rate, number of floors, etc and have a watch all in one.",5
1,I got a smartwatch so that I could hook it up with my dexcom g6 to see my blood glucose levels throughout the day. Even though you can't get the dexcom app you can still get a clock face that shows you your readings from your dexcom. Only complaint is that the battery life isn't 4 days like advertised. Using the dexcom app I have to charge it by the end of day 2. A little bit disappointing but overall I just want the watch while at work to see my levels. I would purchase this over an apple watch or a more expensive brand. Very cute and light weight. I don't even notice I have it on most days.,4
0,"My fourth Fitbit. Having only seen the pictures on line, I was surprised at how large the Versa 2 is. Despite its size, battery life was extremely short when the features for which I purchased the Versa 2 are activated. I could only get life equivalent to my Charge 3 if I only used it like my Charge 3. It was only 3 weeks old when the display failed. I first thought it failed completely but I discovered that if I kept pressing the button to activate the display every few seconds, it would slowly light up, but with an image not unlike a 1960s television. It took a lengthy phone conversation with Fitbit with pictures of the distorted display required before they became convinced my Versa 2 had failed. They promised to get a new one to me immediately. Immediately to them turned out to be 2 weeks. During this time it suddenly dawned on me the reason my average heart rate never changed and I was always have nights with an incredible amount of deep sleep was because the heart rate monitor had also failed. Fortunately my Charge 3 was still in my desk drawer so I put it back in use. The replacement Versa 2 finally arrived but I have decided it will sit in my desk drawer and I will keep using my Charge 3. I may have had better response if I contacted Amazon and asked for a replacement due to product failure but at the time I called Fitbit support, I was in hopes there was some reset of which I was unaware.",1
1,"I love the Versa 2 - or the idea of it. I like that it tells me how many steps left in an hour, the heart rate works pretty consistently (better than my previous Alta HR), records steps more accurately than previous Fitbits.The battery life was about 4 days for the first week or two, then dropped to 2 to 3 days (without a change in settings). I plugged it in last night and charged it to 100%, then put it on before I went to bed. Battery life dropped 25% overnight with no use except on my wrist and I have the do not disturb set so it won't come on at night.The other problem (and I have seen reviews from other people saying the same thing) is the screen. I have to reset my Fitbit every time I want to use it for anything. I can see the ""home screen"" with the time, steps, calories burned and date, but to swipe the screen to see anything (like steps for the hour/day) or use any apps I have to reset the Fitbit. I have seen that other people had this issue and returned their's and it then worked ok. So, I am returning this one and hope to get one that will function properly and keep a battery life for the 4 days it should.If they can get some of these bugs worked out this is a great Fitbit!",3
1,"Maybe my expectations were misaligned with what this product offers. I had an Apple Watch before this which I loved and it was stolen from my car. The price was exactly the same for this item and my previous watch. I thought I could do without some of the app features on the watch, allowing for more battery life than the Apple Watch had. The Apple Watch has a lot of gadgets (apps) that I didn’t use but ran out the battery so that it needed to be charged every evening around 6 pm. Because of that it doesn’t measure sleep (needs to be charged and can’t be worn for days at a time like Fitbit). Okay it turns out the sleep monitoring isn’t a huge need for me. Since this versa 2 arrived I realized it doesn’t synch any of your existing apps and has only preset options for music, strava and some other third party app that I assume measures sleep. I already have pandora, and other apps that I like to synch with my watch. I find it incredibly irritating that I have to set up several third party apps just to use this watch as it’s meant to be used. I apparently created a stravva app years ago with an email I no longer use and can’t reset that so I’m unable to sync this with the watch. The set up is cumbersome and in my opinion not worth the time and effort. I went for a run and the screen isn’t easy to maneuver, you have to swipe many times to see the stats you need as you go. I also doubt it’s accuracy for heart rate monitoring as it would spike to 150 when I was walking and be at about 130 when I was incredibly winded while sprinting. Im sure it’s nice that the battery will last longer and if this was my first fitness watch I would be happy but I feel like I gave up a lot more functional features from my old watch for the same price point. My sleep was not measured at all last night anywhere and I really don’t have the patience to trouble shoot each individual feature of this watch to get the minimal functions it provides. I’m really annoyed that I have to return this and buy another Apple Watch. Hopefully the return goes smoothly. I’ll be without a watch for a few weeks now so I’m pretty upset!",3
0,"I purchased this because the battery life of my existing VERSA has decreased and the band broke. For what I use it for, mostly sleep and activity, it is less accurate than my existing Versa. Moreover, I reversed the band and it work my existing VERSA works better. However, after switching over I am no longer unable to sync my existing VERSA. I thought the battery was going bad on Versa but it is not much worse than the this Versa 2 model - both with same clock face and similar settings.Unless I hear a convincing response from the seller I plan to return this product.Please instruct me how to sync my VERSA.I have already spent hours on this!",2
0,In general I'm happy with my Versa 2. It is sketchy on the sleep picking up accuracy through. I've done all the fixes on the forum but it still misses 2 or 3 nights a week..Revised:This is March 24 2020 and the battery in my Versa 2 seems to be going south already. Since I am past the return time I will have to eat it I guess. I charge it before I go to bed to 100% and before morning it is either dead or close to it. I charged it to 100% at 7 this morning it was so dead it shut off sometime before 5 pm. Very disappointed in this product. I should have taken my sister-in-laws recommendation and bought an apple watch.,1
0,"I bought this because of the Alexa compatibility, but every time you use it, you have to reconnect. As an after thought, for it to work it has to be next to phone which already has Alexa. But, the deal breaker is that the battery lasts about 2 days at the most. I constantly had a dead watch during the day, even when I shut off all the battery drawing functions. My Arie 2 lasted for a week consistently. I pulled out my old watch and put this one away. Also, the on screen navigation is just not user friendly.",1
0,"I have been a Fitbit user for years. I most recently had a Charge HR 2 and decided to upgrade because I used it every day to track various elements of my life. I regret purchasing the Versa 2. I had it for less than two weeks before it totally stopped working and would not turn on. I liked the big display when it worked and like all the features of the mobile app, but I would expect a product this expensive to last much longer than two weeks. Customer service has asked me to return the device and says that I should receive a replacement once they process my return. While I appreciate their willingness to replace an obviously faulty product, I would have preferred a durable product to begin with. If I had to do it over again, I would have kept my old version and never spent the money on this Versa 2.Update: I recieved my replacement, and so far it is working as expected. Hopefully my prior experience was a fluke!",1
1,"I'm glad to have finally been able to get a smartwatch for my Android Phone equivalent to an Apple Watch. I love the versatile apps and Alexa is spot on. She perfectly types out what I say. Now here is where things start to be an issue. The acuracy regarding exercise and beats per minute are wrong. If you are typing or doing text messages, the watch counts these as steps. The resting heart rate is not accurate as it will tell me my resting heart rate is at 110 when I count mine at 85. I am unsure how this can be fixed, but it sucks as an activity and health tracker that it is so inaccurate. Also, you cannot talk to the watch for phone calls. I don't understand why I am able to answer calls if I still have to pull my phone out.",3
1,"I have had this Fitbit for a little over a year and the sensors stopped working. It still works as a really fancy pedometer, but the heart rate sensor and sleep tracking and everything related to the sensors no longer works. I tried all the trouble shooting options out there and the sensors will not come back on.When it did work, I really liked it, but I can't keep buying a product that breaks a little after a year. I never swam or showered with it and I took good care of it but those lights still shut off and haven't come back. I'm pretty sad right now because I got it mostly for the sleep tracking and heart rate tracking.",3
0,"This is third Fitbit I have owned in the last 3 years and this will be the last. Product lasts about a year before it no longer works. Absolutely horrible product and syncing to phone is not all that great either. Notifications come and go on Fitbit with sometimes they come in over and over and other times never show up. Battery life is not all that great either after a year. Takes at least 12 hours often times, now after a year, to get a full charge even when only down to 50%.",1
1,"I took some time to research and compare the Versa with the Apple Watch, and ultimately decided on the Versa, as I didn't feel the extra features on the Apple Watch were necessary for my lifestyle and I prioritized battery life. I haven't regretted that decision for a second. This is a great-looking watch - I have the rose gold frame with the navy and pink woven band, and it's really aesthetically pleasing. The haptic responses are noticeable without being annoying, something I appreciate. From a battery standpoint, I can easly get 5-6 days out of a single charge. Very satisfied with this purchase overall.",5
1,"UPDATE 8/22/20:After a software update early this summer which corrected the connection problems with my Android phone I gotta say this Fitbit Versa 2 is running with perfection! A nice perfect fit, lightweight watch that you can wear 24/7 and hardly know you have it on. Alexa is a nice added feature and working well. I've learned that you need to talk to Alexa in a normal voice and no whisper.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Versa 2 the new improved version? No way, same connectivity problems I have with the original versa. Running and hiking apps hardly ever connect with my Android phone. On my 2nd Android and the same issues. Alexa app has the same problem, worked well the first day now gets stuck on ""thinking"" and no response. My Samsung Galaxy watch never disconnects like the versa. Frankly I've given up on Fitbit, this watch is going back to Amazon.",5
0,"Have been messaging back and forth with Fitbit with issues since purchase in May. Still not resolved. Not tracking heart rate during exercise even though GPS is tracking same exercise. Message after message of fix this, try that, undo this, redo that. I do not have time for all this. Asking amazon how to return it. Getting an Apple Watch instead. Fitbits pair better with androids than iOS.",1
0,"May 5th 2020 update: This POS has finally died. It got to where it would reboot itself almost every hour. I took it off and gave it a proper burial. DO NO PURCHASE this product as it is a huge piece of crap!… this is a piece of junk. out of the box it was great but with the latest firmware update it has become a brick! It locks up, touch screen doesn't work and you are constantly rebooting the dang thing just to get it to work.I can not with a good conscious recommend this unit to anyone. If and when Fitbit (Google) fixes this problem I will update this review.",1
0,"The Versa 2 was exactly what I wanted in a smart watch. Great looking, good features - a nice mix of practical and exercise functions. On Day 1 it was perfect. It paired with the FitBit app super easily and everything was working great. Then by Day 2 the fun started. I woke up in the morning, saw my sleep info, and then it stopped syncing. It wouldn't reconnect, so I followed all the steps I could find online, eventually uninstalling and reinstalling the app to get it to work. Then it worked for a few hours and stopped again. For the last few days if I wanted any data to sync I'd have to repeat this process. I finally decided to download an older version of the app, and that worked for a day, but back to the same thing. FitBit released an app update yesterday and I thought MAYBE this will work. Nope! Not only does it not work, but my watch won't pair with the app AT ALL. When setting up the watch it ""finds it"" and then connects for a really long time before giving me the ""not working"" message. If you can find the watch, why can't it pair?? I don't get it. As much as I want this watch, not having a workable app makes it no better than a standard watch. Oh yeah, and I also tried a hard reset of the watch, but because it won't sync the time isn't even right. I will be returning this watch.",2
1,"I got this as a gift for my husband. We both have used Fitbit for years until I got a used Apple watch from my daughter when she upgraded, and then he got another one to use a few months later. He broke his, so when it came time to replace the broken Apple watch, he opted to have another Fitbit. I got him the Versa 2 so he could wear it swimming laps, and he loves it.I have to admit, the sleep tracker with Fitbit is so much better than any of the apps I've seen for the Apple watch.",5
1,"Purchased 2 of the Versa 2 watches and they update, started working afterlateworked great for 30 days or until they did their most recent update sometime in September. Now the watch is useless and on the play store there is proof to back up my statement. They are only releasing updates for their 2 newest models and basically made the Versa 2 into a fancy digital watch instead of a smart watch. The window to return these 2 watches was one month after the purchases, so kinda a lost. The devs on the plays store are basically ignoring the fact there is an issue with the software, but just don't seem to care as all their focus is on the lastest models. Waste of money, should have just went with a different brand.",4
1,"I love the convenience it provides, and its got plenty to give. However a lot of it is very focused on just health stats. Heart rate, sleep recording, steps taken, calories burned, all great. If you're looking for a health tracker that can double as a general purpose smartwatch, this probably isn't going to be it.First, my biggest complaints and issues.It has a Spotify app, but do not think this means you play Spotify with it. It is a Spotify CONTROL app. Meaning you are just control the instance of Spotify that is on your phone, through the watch. You don't store any songs on the watch, and you cannot leave your phone behind on a run. Controlling your Spotify with the watch app only works about half the time, though, so that's a bummer when it decides not to let you.You CAN load the watch with music, but it will be via downloading the MP3s yourself and loading them manually onto it. Even then, the only time I tried doing that, it didn't seem to want to play my music. The Pandora app seems to be more in line with what I wish the Spotify app to be. You can download stations for offline play and leave your phone at home while you go for a run. I can't attest for how well it works, because I don't use Pandora, but it seems to work the way I want Spotify to.It has Amazon Alexa built in! Which is nice except that it is a pretty stripped down version. I think the most complicated question I got an actual answer for from it was about how many miles from the Earth to the Moon. I wouldn't recommend using Alexa if you can avoid it anyways, since the microphone isn't the most accurate when there's much noise around you. I work a loud job and even when putting the watch right up to my mouth and cupping my hand over it, it had large issues hearing me accurately, if at all.Why?I think a lot of the problem comes from how it interacts with your phone. Many general smartwatches, either with Android's WearOS or Apples' WatchOS, work in a link where the watch talks to the phone in general via Bluetooth, and the appropriate tasks are sent to their specific apps. FitBit really only talks to the FitBit app and anything from the app store.Google recently purchased FitBit, and hopefully they'll bring whatever software and hardware they need to make their own WearOS into a competent fitness tracker so that I can have a watch thats good at both fitness tracking and smartwatch functions.The run-down/good stuff:So what I'm really trying to say is this: FitBit makes a great fitness tracker. If you want a fitness tracker AND good smartwatch in one package, I'd say that the only company with those at the moment is Apple, but I personally am not a fan of them. If you need JUST a great fitness tracking watch, I'd recommend saving the money and getting one of the more basic FitBits.The fit and finish of the FitBit Versa 2 is great. Its got a good screen and the battery life is stellar. I constantly forget to charge not because it needs charging so much but because it needs to be charged so little that I forget I even have to charge it at all. The watchband that came with it gave me extreme dry and itchy skin on my wrist that started flaking and peeling to the point of bleeding, but after finding a comfortable velcro band, I forget I'm even wearing it most of the time.",4
0,"I want to rate this five stars, because I truly LOVE my fitbit verse 2 watch.. but after only 2 months of owning it, it’s totally busted in terms of not charging/turning back on.I read similar reviews before purchasing, but took a chance hoping that my experience would be different.I have never let the watch batter totally die, and have never experienced charging issues. Unfortunately, this weekend, the battery went down to zero and the watch died. I put it on the charger and expected it to charge/turn on without any issue. Not the case.After hours of researching different troubleshooting steps, I am officially out of options and have zero hope that there is any fix to the issue.I am seriously disappointed because I can’t return it and didn’t purchase the warranty.Lesson learned, I guess. I will be buying an Apple Watch with Apple Care next time around. The idea of the watch and all of its apps make it a fantastic buy, but for it to break within 2 months is a super letdown.2 stars because I did enjoy it for a short time.",2
1,"Very nice slim design and I really like the layout on the home screen. I'm not sure though if it tracks steps correctly. The other morning I went to put it on for the first time and it said, as I was standing still, that I had already logged 11 steps - weird. Anyway, it seems to work great. I'm just getting out of a foot cast and an anxious to use it on my walks/runs. My husband has the exact same model and has been using it on his workouts and loves it. That's the main reason we purchased these - for the health tracking.",5
0,"I've only had this device for six months and it's been nothing but problems. The battery will be three-quarters full and an hour later, dead. Each time I reach out to support they want me to fully charge, sync every hour, let the battery drain to zero, sync again, and then contact them. The only suggestions they have beyond that is to turn off all unnecessary features. So I bought a device for it's fancy options but you're telling me not to use them? And no explanation for spontaneous battery dying? They will do whatever they can not to honor the warranty. Oh, and good luck finding an email address. It doesn't exist anymore. Your options for support are live chat or phone call.I have been a faithful Fitbit user for 10 years, and they have gone completely downhill. I'm off to find a replacement from a different company.",1

The Fitbit app which is paid by insurance because of age, went crazy, with the friends, was in 3 place,in a day Lost 40, 000 steps and dropped to 6th, Alex no longer works.Even my photo disappeared Read most all Question's on the product page, spend more time trying to sync then what the watch was worth . Very poor product support. Only good thing, it fit well on wrist, but even the sleep tracker stopped that day. Very Unhappy",1
0,"This is my second Versa! The first one stopped working after 1 year I did nothing ! This one stopped after 2 months! I notified Asurion right away ... they told me that the watch was still under manufacturers warranty, so I had to call them. I will try doing that on Monday, since they don’t take calls on Weekends. Having read other comments, I am not very hopeful ... but will revise if I have more positive report. I will not buy another Fitbit!",1
1,"This review refers to the band only, not the watch. The band connected instantly thus the 5 stars. Below is my review of the 1st Versa 2 I received.This is the 2nd Versa 2 that I have received - the first one was returned as I could not install the larger band. I have had at least 4 Versas and am very familiar with changing the bands and have learned how to do it. However, the first Versa 2 I received had a defective band as it would not connect. When I received my 2nd Versa 2, the band connected immediately reenforcing my thought that the first Versa 2 band was defective. I don't know why Amazon would send a brand new Versa 2 that was defective. Be aware if you have trouble with the bands.",5
0,Had this one for almost a year and now it has started this flickering display thing. Color goes away and it's like watching static on an old black and white TV. Tried support they just made me reset it again which I had already tried. It's intermittent. After the last reboot it worked for a few hours. Seems related to notifications. It always goes bonkers during notifications. Looking for an alternative replacement as apparently Fitbit won't replace it. Not getting another one of these but there are not really any good alternatives. :(,1
0,"Screen chipped within the first 24 hours after a corner was barely bumped. Battery life I thought would be better. Should have bought an apple watch...Update 11/23/19Noticed this Saturday morning that for two days I have no heart rate data. So my sleep data is incomplete. I did try to hard reboot the smart watch. I've also turned off the heart rate monitor in settings, shut down, turned the heart rate monitor back on, shut down and it worked for a little bit. Couple minutes or so. Didn't know it stopped again until this morning and for a second day my sleep data is messed up. I really don't understand these issues with these devices. I never had so many problems so soon after buying a fitbit product. The Flex, Alta and Alta HR. The Blaze was good when it didn't keep popping out of its housing. Almost getting lost many times at work because I almost didn't notice it wasn't on my wrist.",1
0,"It would be fantastic if it worked. Versa 1 quit after 18 months, so I upgraded. Versa 2 quit after eight, sent it in for a replacement, replacement was glitchy from the get go. Sleep tracking was decent, but it continued to track even after I was up and moving for half an hour. Stair count was always off. Some days I climbed 10 flights of stairs and it didn’t register, some days it registered half a dozen and I didn’t climb one. Many times the app stated the tracker “couldn’t be found” when I was trying to synch. Soft, then hard reset didn’t help. So basically I use it for an alarm, timer and watch. Hella disappointed with this product. Do not recommend.",2
0,"I'm very disappointed. It synced for exactly two days, and I couldn't get it to sync again after trying everything for two more days. It's a very nice looking Rose fact w/Bordeaux band. It also offers tons of different faces from which to choose. I chose a flower that went well with the watch colors. I was also happy to learn there are a variety of inexpensive bands and face guards to change the appearance at will. Unfortunately, the long-awaited watch was defective. :>Update: Spoke with Fitbit customer service. They believe the Versa watch features aren't compatible with my LG Sytlo 2 phone, which caused the problem. Wish there were compatibility warnings before I wasted so much time. Am still disappointed as it's such a pretty watch, and I loved the face I chose. I'm thankful I still have my Fitbit Charge 3 that works well for m.",1
0,I am extremely disappointed and unsatisfied with Fitbit as a company. I was very excited to get the new Versa as it was compatible with Alexa. All components of the watch work and are awesome except for receiving text notifications. I have contacted the company several times and they have been of zero help. I want a refund but now they tell me I have to go to Amazon for an refund but the Amazon return window has closed. Now I am stuck with an expensive watch that is only 2 months old and doesn't do what it is supposed to do. Fitbit should stand by their products or not sell them until their bugs are worked out. Don't waste your time or money.,1
0,"I had this Versa 2 for about 6 months and the screen started popping out (exposing the inside mechanisms of the watch). I contacted Fitbit Support and after sending them photos of my issue, they sent me a replacement device. After about a month and a half the replacement versa 2 just stopped working. The screen was blank and it would not power on. I contacted Fitbit support again. They walked me through a couple of basic troubleshooting steps to reboot the versa 2, to no avail. I was then told by the Fitbit support representative that because this was a replacement device, she could not help me any further. So, in a nutshell, the versa 2 is a decent smartwatch when it is actually in working condition. Please beware that the build quality of the device is not the best and once you get one replacement, you will get no more help from Fitbit support no matter how long you have had the device. In total I paid $200 for a Versa 2 that lasted about 8 months. That is not acceptable in my opinion. I would suggest spending a little extra $$ and going with a far superior product with an Apple Watch.",2
0,"As I write this, the FitBit is on it's way to Asurion for it to get fixed for the fourth time in a less than one year period (the face plate keeps falling off). I just cancelled my Fitbit subscription because of it, I am so thankful I purchased the Asurion protection plan because I will keep continuing to file a claim until they either give me the amount insured or they will need to spend time and money to continue fixing it and shipping it to me for the next 2 years . My next smart watch will not be a fitbit for sure, which is a shame because I liked their app.",1
0,"I bought this device in August 2020 and by July 2021 the button broke and I only had limited use of the device. They offer you a 1 year warranty and I missed the window. So I didn't contact them for help until the band broke this past January 2022. Instead of even offering to fix it for a cost, they only offered me a 35% off code on my next purchase. This discount code applied to any purchase turned out not to matter as all their items are on sale and so the discount code didn't matter. Turns out I looked into their online community and EVERYONE REPORTS THIS BROKEN BUTTON ISSUE, and if you don't get it in time you are out of luck.",1
0,"We started with the fitbit Ionic, it died after 3 months and we assumed because it was refurbished that was the culprit, we then purchased this Versa 2. The package was opened December 29th, 2019. I paid for a 3 year warranty just to be safe. Barely 5 months later in May, 2020 it just wouldn't turn, so they honored the warranty and replaced it. By January 2021, just 7 months later the replacement died again, one minute it was working and the next it wouldn't turn on. (Its well cared for, not gotten wet or anything) They said the warranty doesn't cover more than one, so they would not be replacing it. 3 fitbits all last less than a year, seems like some sort of manufacturing flaw. Hoping the Versa 3 is a better device.",2
0,"First time I have been motivated to write a review for a product on Amazon.I have had the Fitbit Versa 2 for about a month and the sensor for measuring the number floors/flights of stairs traveled. Fitbit support immediately determined it needed to be replaced. Unfortunately, they wanted me to send the tracker (that I use daily) back to them before they would send a replacement (approximately 10 business days turnaround for a device that, again, I use daily...). I would have been happy to send the defective device back after receiving the replacement, but this was not something they could accommodate.Battery life is much better than my old Versa, but I don't think I can continue to use Fitbit products due to the poor customer service.",1
1,"My original OG Fitbit had finally died and so I finally caved into the upgrade and I’m super happy with it. It was between this or the Apple Watch. I went with Fitbit because I really want the watch for the health tracking and other fitness features and I didn’t want a mini phone on my wrist. I have a phone for a reason!! Lol but you can still use this Fitbit to send you notifications when you get a text message, email, and control Spotify and stuff so if you are looking for a mini phone on your wrist, you still have that option. Changing the bands was extremely difficult the first time but once you figure out it’s not hard. Don’t give up on the watch because of the band!!",5
0,"I want to mention that this is my third Fitbit and I’ve liked them all and never had a problem. However, this Fitbit was a pain to set up. It took me two weeks of attempting to have my iPhone or iPad recognize it. That included searching online and watching YouTube vids. Finally it happened (no clue what I did).The app is not intuitive. I still can’t get the info I used to find and use on my last Fitbit.The battery is supposed to last for four days- mine lasts one... and I wear a GPS watch for at least six hours a day while I play golf, so I’m not even wearing the Fitbit a good portion of the day.I charged it yesterday early morning; this morning it was dead. Finally got it charged and now the time is 6 hours off. And my iPad is not “finding” it again! Really? It may be pretty but it sure doesn’t work well. Very frustrating.",1
1,"* The watch is too weak to do anything particularly useful. The UI is very limited and many of the apps can't be adjusted at all on the watch itself. You can't even adjust interval times for an interval workout on the watch. As a result, I don't use the watch apps for much.* It shows phone calls and email notifications. The phone call notifications are alright, but the email notifications arrive in massive batches that can obscure your current workout view.* No built-in GPS so you need to bring your phone along for accurate workout statistics, making its advantages over a mobile phone even smaller.* The two things it adds on top of a regular mobile phone fitness app are sleep tracking and heart rate monitoring. Sleep tracking is alright and much easier than remembering when I actually fell asleep, though I'm not sure how accurate some of the sleep phase measurements are. Heart rate monitoring is rather terrible whenever you are doing exercises with high heart rate variability such as intervals. For me, it consistently undercounts my heart rate with laughably high errors. A 15 second count of my carotid artery gives a heart rate of 160, whereas the watch gives a rate of 115. I can get more accuracy from a 3 second count of my carotid than this without paying over $150.* The app is decent for calorie tracking, step counting, checking hours where you met the 250 step goal, etc. Though you can get the app for free and use mobile tracking for free. Beware: the mobile tracker tripled my footsteps one day so I had to disable it.* Not enough features for an app that has so few jobs. Workout groups exist with features like contests. But there are no contests for things like mile time, etc. It largely centers around steps. The calorie tracker doesn't support ""calorie builder"" features of any kind, only custom dish entries that can be scaled by servings or serving size.* I've seen insane bugs such as interval times constantly getting reset by the watch after adjusting them from the mobile app. This is especially funny since the watch doesn't let you set interval times. How can it mess up the interval times when it doesn't even allow you to set interval times? You tell me.* The watch has pretty good battery time. I've only ever had it die on me once or twice. I charge it around twice a week and use it around the clock, even when showering most of the time. Though it started to cause my skin to peel after a month. This has improved since I started washing it more often and not wearing it in the shower.It's definitely better than not having a fitness watch or using a fitness app. However, I would recommend spending more money for a higher quality product like an Apple Watch.",3
1,"I recently bought a Fitbit Versa 2 and I am about 80% satisfied with it's performance. I was able to go about 5-6 days between charges, there are several free clock faces available and many more for a low cost (usually $1 or $2).My wife has a Versa that we bought a couple years ago. Both the Versa and the Versa 2 are supposed to work with Wifi (only 2.4Ghz) but neither of our Fitbits work on Wifi. I've reset the Fitbit, reset my iphone, turned Bluetooth off and on, and even though the app says the Fitbit has connected with Wifi, when I check the Fitbit (Settings - About - IP Address) it says ""Wi-fi off"". Also, if I check my wireless router it does not show the Fitbit MAC address in the list of connected devices. It simply does not work.This could pose a problem in the future because Fitbit uses Wifi to install upgrades. This is very disappointing because I have light bulbs, video cameras, and phones that work with Wifi, but my Fitbit does not.",4

0,"My most recent purchase was for my 3rd Fitbit. First one was purchased in 2016 (HR) and was still working with a weakening battery charge when I decided it was time for an upgrade. So, in December 2019 I upgraded to a Versa 2 (by then Google had bought and assumed control of Fitbit.) That watch worked great in all situations until it died in January 2021...after a swim in a pool. That was shocking because that Fitbit survived several Ocean and pool swims prior to that. The third Fitbit was purchased in January 2021 but quit working in March 2021 (less than 2 months old) due to the home button no longer working. As an Apple user, the money I’ve spent on Fitbit only to have 2 Versa 2’s die in less than 15 months makes me regret not buying an Apple Watch by to start with! The Versa 2 is not worth the money. The “return” period on Amazon is way too short and not worth the money you save by buying a Versa 2 here. Save the headache and buy a different fitness watch elsewhere.",2
1,"So far I love my Fitbit Versa 2. To be honest, was looking for a watch for communication in addition to fitness tracking.1. I can see my incoming calls, accept or reject them. I can respond to text messages by quick reply or voice. The voice works great.2. Heart rate pretty accurate3. So many additional options for apps4. Links with Alexa (haven't done yet).5. One downside I read was the fitbit loosong its sync ability. This did happen to me. I was devastated the other night when it wouldn't sync and couldn't get it to repair no matter what I did. Battery was in the 30% range, decided to charge it up overnight and reassess in the am. It re paired with the phone and sync'd without an issue, dontbknow what happened. Hoping it doesn't happen again.",4

Customer service said I must have hit it for the watch to crack (which didnt happen)...so wont replace the faceplate. Its unfortunate Fitbit doesnt work with customers for clearly a product issue. Especially after having paid over $200 for it. As an avid athlete, I wont be supporting their company any longer and will purchase a new watch from another company.",1
0,I received my Versa 2 in December 2019. When it worked it was ok. I never felt the heart rate was correct. The mobile part was convenient and worked most of the time but I wouldn’t say it was great. Within the first year it just died. Customer service was great and I received a new watch. A few weeks ago my second Versa 2 wouldn’t charge and became so hot I couldn’t touch it. This watch is at most 18 months old. Customer service has offered me 30% off a new watch… an offer I had to use within 24 hours. I have several gym friends that have made the switch from fitbit to a watch that matches their phones and are “100% happier”. I will not buy another FitBit,2
1,I was a little hesitant at first to order from this seller as he doesn’t have many reviews but I’m glad I did. The item was exactly as described and works great!,5
1,"Originally I gave this product a two star review because I had so many syncing issues. I was using an Android phone that was a little on the older side and definitely on the cheaper side. I have since switched to an iPhone and now have zero issues!I love how my texts show up on the Fitbit. It is very useful for when I am at work and don’t have my phone directly on me.I also love the mobile app. There are so many fun things you can track and learn about. I have lost 12 pounds since I started logging my food. I’ve never been one to count calories, but the Versa 2 makes it fun and you feel accomplished for doing it.The only reason I didn’t give the product 5 stars is because of the connectivity issues with the old Android phone. Not everyone wants to or is able to afford a top of the line phone. Other than that, the Versa 2 is wonderful!",4
0,I purchased the FITBIT Versa 2 primarily to track my sleep and secondarily to track my heart rate while sleeping. A few months after it arrived it began inaccurately tracking both. Some nights it would say I only slept 1 or 2hours when I know I slept at least 7! It similarly was not tracking my heart rate correctly.I called their service technicians twice and they told me what to do to troubleshoot. Still wasn’t working so I emailed as they suggested I do. More troubleshooting steps. Emailed two more times and the Fitbit is STILL NOT WORKING. This back and forth between Fitbit and me has gone on for almost a month and they still won’t send me a replacement for a tracking watch that is unusable! Wish I bought a different more reliable brand.,2
1,"I like this watch. The app doesn't drain my phone battery like the cheaper $50 watches do. But I only wear it while exercising and turn the bluetooth off otherwise so maybe that's why. It is accurate on arc trainer and elliptical though you can be slightly higher than arc trainer machine (cybex brand), for heart rate and calorie count.It only counts about 100 steps or less for driving but my gym isn't too far, the main calorie count comes from using exercise apps as it seems to count less if you don't turn those on for some reason.You can delete apps through phone app though, to save battery.Now my issues with the watch-1) Every time or every other time I turn it off and the next time I turn it on I lose a single percentage of battery (sometimes 2).2) It feels like the battery should last longer, I work out for 1.5 to 2hours and I lose like 3% give or take battery, once it is off 99%. Last monday it had 99 battery and today it is on 83%, I only wear it 2hrs a day, 3-4, sometimes 5 days a week.3) I would use the calorie part of the app if I could type in bar code like MYfitnessPal, my hands tremble real bad so I can't use the scanner too easily. Other wise I use it for keeping track of calories burned.4) Pro or con, the on button on the side is super sensitive, I have to check and make sure it is off if I put it in my pocket.5) Calorie burnt is accurate but I can't tell if distance is judged wrong on elliptical or arc trainer machines or the watch. I don't do treadmill due to flat feet and knee issues. Don't suppose distance takes precedent too often over those things though.",3
1,"After much research, this was my choice for smartwatch. Best device ever! Easy to respond to texts verbally, tracks sleep accurately, and email notifications come through quickly. You cannot answer calls from this device, but I did not want that option. Holds your music for the gym and working out. Alexa compatible and that feature has come in quite handy. I use this device every day for morning alarm. My battery lasts 6 days. Dozens of bands available to keep it new and different. Definitely recommend!",5
1,"I have had the versa, the versa 2 (two of them!) and the versa 3 and each one I have to reset it. Why? The weather apps don’t work well and neither does the preset app that it comes with. About 9-10 times a day I have to hold the button in and reset it. And it keeps getting kicked off of the wifi. I only get Fitbit in case I ever go to an android phone that I’m not stuck with an Apple Watch that I can’t use. I wish Fitbit would work on this problem, it’s not just my particular watch cuz every one that I’ve had (5 total) does this",3
0,"I've had numerous issues with this device. Almost exactly five months after I bought it the screen detached (see photo), and was hanging loose; it took over a month to get a warranty replacement. Now, nine months after that replacement arrived I've started experiencing numerous software issues, including the device spontaneously uninstalling faces and apps and restarting for no reason, being stuck on old firmware for a week or two after doing a full reset of the device, sleep and heart rate data not loading into the app correctly, etc. Support seems to only be able to tell you to to various degrees of uninstalling/re-installing and resetting, which solved a few of the problems, while seeming to cause others. Because this is now outside of the original warranty period, and resetting/uninstalling/etc. the device and app doesn't fix the issues, I have only been offered a limited time 35% discount on a replacement device.Even when it's not actively breaking or experiencing bugs the experience is underwhelming.Heart rate tracking seems to be unable to keep up with high rates during exercise, often reporting a value significantly below that reported by other trackers or manual counting when over ~150 BPM. Even when manually telling it that one is about to do a certain exercise, and waiting to make sure it has properly connected to the phone's GPS signal, tracking of distance/route while walking/biking is inconsistent at best.Sleep tracking is highly inaccurate, and seems to be unable to distinguish between using a computer, watching a movie, and actually sleeping. It often reports overall sleep for the night of an hour or more above other trackers, in addition to frequently confusing daytime sedentary activities with naps.Nighttime blood oxygen tracking is limited to min, max, and average values, which can only be recorded while using a specific, ugly, watch face, and the min and max values can only be viewed on that watch face on the watch during the day after that night, while access to the average values more than a week old are locked behind the monthly subscription, along with many of the other sleep stats.",2
0,"Accuracy was off on tracking my stair flights (even with using gps) and this left me untrusting of the accuracy of the other tracking options such as: steps, exercise, heart rate. From the first day, the SP O2 sensor was inaccurate as well. After just under 5 months of use, the sleep tracking quit working entirely and simultaneously the device quit synching to my phone. I have been unable to correct this even after uninstalling the app and reinstalling it, turning off bluetooth for this device and then turning bluetooth back on and relinking the device etc. Weeks later, the device quit tracking my entered water intake. So now, the device simply tells time and counts my steps. It was definitely not worth the money for the short time it worked. I wasn't aware that I could buy any extended warranty and I missed the return window for exchange. I am very disappointed.",2
0,"Fitbit are locking access to my own health data that used to be free behind a paywall.The app updated some time ago and I could no longer see if I was restless during the night. Details were chopped off, and I could get further access to my own health data by subscribing to their service.",1
1,"I love the colors of this fitbit Versa 2--pink and rose gold. I like that the face of the watch shows the time, day, date, and steps, heart rate, and calories burn. It was very easy to set up and add to my app. I've been using it for only a day, but I expect it will work well from hereon. I did get a warranty for it, just in case, but since I had no trouble with my blaze, except to replace the band over the 5 years I used it, I think this will work equally as well. My blaze still works great and I am passing it on to a relative who wanted to try it out.",5
1,"Love this watch, I was wanting a activity tracker but also a smart watch without spending a whole ton and this fits the bill! Plus I can view my blood sugars from my dexcom G6 CGM app directly onto my watch which is super helpful when monitoring my blood sugar while working out or doing lawn work. Highly recommend this :)",5
0,I am really disappointed since I have had my Fitbit Versa 2 for only 2 years and it stopped working after I have been swimming with it despite having a swim tracker which I understand it as being waterproof . I don’t know what to do about it . I have read about others having the same problems and they might have started working again after 2 days but now it’s more than 5 days and it’s totally dead. Fitbit should not claim that it has a swim tracker if it’s not waterproof . I am seriously thinking of buying an Apple Watch instead . This was my second Fitbit . The first one also stopped working after a short while,1
1,"Glad I made this purchase. I was debating on the Versa 1, but I decided to go up to the Versa 2. The bands that come with are silky and SO amazing. I have really sensitive skin, so I through they would irritate my skin, but it is far from that. So silky smooth. The battery life is awesome. The sleep feature is so cool. The fun different apps you can add are fun, most are in testing form but it is really cool. I love how many backgrounds there are and you can keep a few in a stored space to change as needed. I really like the feature of seeing your phone activity on the watch, and you can talk-text reply to text messages. if you ever have issues with clearing the notifications out, you can do a reset by holding the button down for like 10-15 seconds. Its good to do a reset every once in a while.",5
1,"I think this does a good job of tracking sleep (unless you sleep less than three hours). I am pretty sure it over tracks my steps and I am not sure how it tracks stairs.The battery lasts 4-5 days.I don't believe this is water proof. I haven't tried it and I suggest you don't either.This is kind of uncomfortable for me to wear. I work in a physical environment so I use my wrists a lot. This might be better for people who only want to track walking/ running.It is still nice and I still like it. It encourages me to exercise more even though it may not be completely accurate. Plus it has nice features like incoming calls and texts.So if you want something that gives you an estimate on your health and don't need something waterproof, this might be right for you.",3
1,"I bought this for my husband, who is about as low-tech as they come. He LOVES it! It probably has a lot of functions he'll never use, but he bought it for the ones he DOES use, like time-telling, calorie counting, step counting, ... Set up was easy (for me; might have been more difficult if he'd had to do it without help since he doesn't work with computers at all!) We're impressed that the battery charge lasted almost a full week before needing recharging. He likes the watch so well, he wants me to get one too, and I'm planning to.",5
0,"It was really hard to let this one go. I love the simplicity of the operating system - its not trying to be a wrist cellphone. Which I loved. It was perfect for tracking activity, sleep, calories, etc.But - it caused me severe, aching wrist pain. I had never had pain in my wrist before wearing this watch. At first, if I went a few hours without wearing the watch, the pain would subside. But after while, I could leave the watch off for days at a time and still be in pain. That's after about 2 months of trying to make it work.Also I thought the watch face was way too big - but I do have small wrists and hands. I think this watch is out of proportion for women or people with small wrists.I switched to the galaxy active 2 and haven't had any pain for a few weeks now. It does have many more features that are fun to use - but is less elegant and simple. However - it looks better on my wrist and isn't causing me pain - so it's a win in my book.Functionality 5/5Wearability 1/5",2
1,"I had the original fitbit charge HR that lasted 4 months. Got a free replacement under warranty which lasted 3 years. I tried the cheap generic version which was okay but not enough memory and responsiveness that i was used to in my old fitbit. I decided to get the versa2 when i found it on sale for $99 which i thought was good deal. Band is now certainly a lot easier to replace! Hopefully, this will last at least a few years and will update this review longevity and durability.",5
1,"I love this FitBit! Purchased as a Mother’s Day gift for myself, and it came with three free months of FitBit Premium- which gives even more detailed readings and includes guided breathing exercises, yoga, cardio workouts and so much more! I have an iPhone, so I can’t respond to texts from it but it’s nice to just glance at my wrist and see my incoming messages and alerts, and who is calling- before I run to find my phone. I’m not a big fan of the standard band it came with, as it feels hot to me as we start summer weather- but there seems to be a wide variety of replacement styles and materials online. I love this watch and just having it on my wrist makes me more aware of my choices and keeps my health in the front of my mind.",5
1,"I waited a long time to pick the ""perfect"" new fitbit. I used the fitbit Charge 2 for what seemed like forever. I was unable to wear it for long periods of time due to it hurting and leaving a small mark on my wrist. But, I still loved it, especially for the sleeping app. I finally bought a new fitbit, the Versa 2! I love it! It fits my hand perfect and does not hurt! I love the watch face apps and the information that it gives for the sleep app is wonderful! I wish it had blood pressure, that would throw it over the top. The price was great for this investment! High recommend.",5
1,"Love the look of this Fitbit! So many people have asked if it’s a new Apple Watch. I also love that it tracks my heart rate and steps on the front screen. I don’t have an android phone, so my smart phone doesn’t connect to it to receive texts/incoming calls which was a bit disappointing. It doesn’t connect to Apple. I bought it specifically to use in case of emergency while I walk my dog. Also, unless you have an active Alexa account through Amazon prime, you can’t access Spotify through the watch. I do not have an Alexa account, so I’m missing out on using it for music, but that’s ok. That being said, I still love the new fitbit watch. Its sharp looking, functions as a real watch which I enjoy, and keeps me on track with moving.It’s definitely an upgrade from my Flex2 and battery life seems very durable. I would definitely recommend!",5
0,"Had the watch for 3 months, it stopped working and found it was past the return time so Amazon gave me the number to fitbit. I contacted them several times and they attempted to reset the watch. It still would not work. They said I needed to send a video proving that it did not work. Once received then they would decide if it might still be under warranty. I tried to send the video several times and it would not accept the video. Therefore I am stuck with a mal-functioning watch. If I would have known this was the hassel to go through I would have bought it at a store that I could take it back and they would except it without this hassel.I SUGGEST TO NOT BUY A FITBIT WATCH ON AMAZON!!!!! THERE IS NO SOLUTION!",1
0,"I am addicted to knowing my steps, but the fitbits I buy continue to peter out. This one lasted one day. They promise a 6 day battery life. It arrived 40% charged and depleted over night. When It came back to life after charging, the time was wrong and it could not update, despite constant nagging on the app. I've interviewed Fitbit IC designers as part of my job and learned they secretly admit they have inferior technology. Can Google get their act together? I hope so.",1
1,"Awesome product does everything it say it does in ad, Great price, battery life great depends on how many apps you use and the clock face you choose,Thousands of free clock faces, sleep tracking great comes with small and Lg. Band . I have been a fitbit user for over 11 years now reallyyenjoy their products this is my 1st. Smart watch I've only had the trackers until now. Some apps won't work until you update it and you need wifi to do so.",5
0,Burn? Rash? Not quite sure what this Versa Did to my wrist but it’s extremely uncomfortable and now I’ve had a big red mark on my wrist for days. Very disappointed with this product as I really wanted to enjoy it.Not only did I get this mark but I barely received my versa less than a month ago and it already had technical issues. It wouldn’t stop restarting repeatedly. All I saw was the Logo pop up then disappear over and over again rendering the Versa 2 useless.,2
0,"It’s very disappointing to spend this much money on something that doesn’t track sleep properly… I bought this for my mom primarily to help her track her sleep and she reported that it worked well for about a week and now if she gets up in the middle of the night or even just rolls over and awakens for just a minute and goes right back to sleep, it stops counting her sleep time. I just did a search and saw many many people complaining about this problem over the last few years and apparently they still have not solved the problem.",2
1,"I absolutely love this Fitbit! I had the Fitbit one, the charge 3, and now the Versa 2. This is by far my favorite Fitbit. It tracks my sleep, my steps, my heart rate, and my fertility all accurately. There are a bunch of apps that can be downloaded via the Fitbit app. I love the Alexa feature as well. I don’t like the fact so much that I need to have the Fitbit app running in the background in order for Alexa to work but it is what it is. As soon as you close the app, Alexa doesn’t work. But our phones nowadays are built to handle some apps running in the background. So since it actually doesn’t affect my phone battery (iPhone XR), I don’t really care. I’m just in the habit of closing out of all my apps so it was a hard habit to break. The battery lasts about 5 days which is pretty good for a smart watch, but I do wish it lasted a lot longer.",5
1,"The media could not be loaded.
 So I’d been using that same series 2 Apple Watch for the last 3 years I like it. BUT IF YOU CARE MORE/HAVE OF AN FOCUS HEALTH AND FITNESS DEFINITELY GET A FITBIT! I got the VERSA 2 before it still has Apple Watch FEEL but is essentially HALF THE PRICE! I don’t need Facebook messenger and other random notifications coming to my watch. I do like that I can receive text notifications. The FITBIT APP IS ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS! I’m actually thinking about quitting WW and just tracking calories through the app! Because I’m in a STEPBET that doesn’t allow me to switch devices until the of the game I still wear my Apple Watch. I notice my FitBit ALWAYS tells me I’ve certain hit mile markers earlier and burned more calories. I was EXTRA excited because I finally caught the $50 off sale even got my mom one for Mother’s Day!",5
0,"A waste of money. It's suppose to sync with Alexa. It does not. It is suppose to sync and alert you with text, phone calls etc. It doesn't do that either. It is a watch. Tracks you steps. You have to track your own water. Not what I thought I was buying. I am returning it.",1
0,"I read the wonderful reviews on this and thought I would give it a try. The first thing I noticed was the screen. It has a childish look to it. The actual screen is alot smaller then the size of the monitor. I turned the watch on and connected it, then tried to connect spotify. I have the premium membership so it should have worked. It didn't. I watched videos on youtube that it wont connect and to keep trying...which is ridiculous. I gave up and put the watch on and after 10 minutes of being frustrated with it I reset it and put it back in the box and request a refund.******buyers beware Heart Rate Monitors USA is who sent me the product. They charge a 10% restocking fee and the cost of the return ticket. So, instead of getting fully refunded I am only getting 186 back.",2
0,"I have had sooo many issues with this version of Fitbit, and I had hardly any with all of my previous models. I am not sure what happened to this one, but I have had it replaced twice and this one still doesn't sync properly. I have a Samsung Galaxy S7 phone that it stopped syncing to about 6 months ago. So I can only sync it to my tablet now. My problems started as soon as I received my device though. It set up fine out of the box, but then it started having issues syncing and the display went black. It eventually just wouldn't turn back on at all which is when I got the first replacement. The ones since have mostly just stopped syncing after a while. My latest replacement I received about a month ago, and it has already stopped syncing all together. Each time I have reached out to Fitbit support where they would assist me to either get it working again for a little while or with a replacement, but 3 watches in less than a year is a bit much. If I were you I would skip this model. Maybe you'll have better luck with one of the other ones.",2
1,"I have been a Fitbit user for years....alta, charge, original versa....but have only had problems with the Versa 2 as far as syncing problems. I have owned my V2 since Christmas 2020, and had problems syncing this past week. I did all the recommendations for correction, including a factory default reset, soft reset, and even deleting Fitbit app and reinstalling. Nothing worked. With the factory default reset, I lost all my data from 2014! I began losing time on the clock face by 3 minutes and was becoming discouraged. Then, a few minutes ago, I noticed the time was finally correct. My Versa 2 now syncs! History is still gone but all seems to be well. So what caused the issue with the software....I can only surmise that all the baking and dishwater cleanup I have done this past week, perhaps water messed with the software and interfered with the sync. PS...I never wear my Versa 2 in the shower. If you have exposed your watch to water and are encountering sync problems, let it dry. I am wondering if putting a watch on rice would have the same effect. I do not claim water was the issue bit thought this might be a clue to sync problems. Good luck to those having issues.",4
1,"Cons: Fitbit inexplicably does not include a ""find-phone"" feature on the Versa. Unbelievable. Also, contrary to advertised claims, the Versa 2 is NOT lighter than the original Versa: it's actually a little heavier. Nor is it ""sleeker"" (dimensions are the same. Omitting the two buttons does not make it more sleek). I wish they would streamline the width to make it look like the Apple version.Pros: Huge selection of clock faces as well as a wide variety of watch bands (both available to purchase from many vendors). Long battery life.I bought the Versa 2 because the screen-swipe capability on my original Versa stopped working after about 1.5 years of use. The suggested fixes only worked for a few swipes and then the screen would freeze again. Plus, at the time, Amazon had knocked $40 off the price of the Versa 2. I still don't know if I'll ever use Alexa or some of the added features on the Versa 2. So, if it had not been on sale, I probably would have purchased another original Versa.",4
1,"I bought this for myself on black friday this year, although I thought I got a deal, it turned out cheaper 2 days later and has been at the same discounted price ever since. But its a very good smart watch. Plus the alexa integration has been nice for my smarthome stuff, although It does seem to have issues with losing connection alot. I'll ask something then it shows 'thinking' then pops up a screen that says connection lost, please sync with fitbit app. That gets pretty annoying. I shouldnt have to open my fitbit app every few days to let it sync, it already sends info back and forth regularly tracking my stats anyways. Hopefully in version 3 they will get the alexa bugs figured out. Battery life is very good though, I only charge mine up abotu every 4 days, and it only takes about an hour or so depending how low it is",4
1,"I've only had the Versa 2 for a few days but already love it. Easy setup and charging. Love the mist Gray color band and it goes with everything. It paired easily with my Android Samsung Galaxy S7 phone., just follow directions. My only complaint is that no setup directions come with the watch package. You must go online to FitBit.com to find setup directions; however after you get started, all steps appear on the watch. You must also download the app on your phone to customize the features you want to appear and track on your watch. I've had no problems thus far. I shopped for a Versa 2 in several retail stores but Amazon is the only place I could find multiple color choices and extra color bands if I need them in the future. You won't be disappointed with this watch.",5
1,"I have had my fitbit for 2 weeks now and I absolutely love it. I love how I can keep up with my calorie intake and my calories burned at the same time. The app is super easy to use and so is the actual fitbit. I love that I can look at other things on the watch like the weather and my spotify. The sleep tool is one of my favorites, i love seeing how well I slept and when I woke up throughout the night. Another feature that I didn't realize I would use so much is the stopwatch and the timer. I also love that it synced with my calendar on my phone and I can look at that whenever I'd like and not have to open my phone for this. I found that the heart rate monitoring is very consistent with other trackers and I love the hourly reminders to walk. Great watch all around",5
1,"I've had the watch for about a week. I've enjoyed it. I'm still learning it. It seems to be accurate. I've had no issues at all. I have not used it while showering but have not taken it off while washing out baby bottles.All seems to be well.You can't connect to Spotify unless you have a paid subscription.I did t buy it for the sleep tracker so I've no clue if that part is spot on.Battery seems to hold up for about 4 days. Take about an hour, maybe a bit less to charge.It is very hard to replace the band. Good thing is it comes with the small and the large. But swapping them out is a chore. 😩I've had it for about a month and some change now. I really enjoy this watchm the batter is pretty good. It takes maybe 2 hours to charge and that's a generous amount of time. It's fully charged very quick.It works while shopping but I think when I'm pushing a shopping cart some steps get skipped. It seems to be accurate when it comes to any type of exercising. I usually have my heart rate monitor on with my Garmin watch. It's a nice step up from the Blaze. I'm still waiting on face plates and new bands from China. I couldn't afford to buy them from Amazon or the Fitbit website. So far so good.If you're on the fence, get off and buy it.",5
1,"I researched this for a while. I wanted a fitness watch that didn't cost a bundle, and didn't need to have GPS. Versa 2 fits the bill. It does all the things people say it does. Here's what you may not hear:1. The band sucks. It itches, especially with the slightest amount of moisture or long term wear. If you have a waterproof watch, you shouldn't need to take it off to shower. (And even if you did, your wrist still stays wet for a bit.)2. It tracks calorie burn on indoor biking (Spinning) pretty accurately by relying on heart rate.3. It has a sleep mode which turns off notifications while in bed AND prevents the watch from becoming all lit up when your wrist moves.My advice: Get this watch. AND order a matching metal band (I bought a Fitlink and I love it.)",5
1,"I like most everything about the FitBit Versa 2. The app is simple, and I like the sleep tracking. It seems pretty accurate.The step tracker is a bit sensitive. I’ve reached goals while sitting and watching tv.And I wish there were more watch faces to choose from. I don’t want to purchase and download something with a warning attached to it.Overall, I’d recommend it. I myself would purchase another. I hat purchased an Apple Watch, but returned it. I’ll not tech savvy enough for that.",4
1,"Love this watch! I was a little hesitant when reading some of the reviews, but I'm glad I went through with my order! Mind you, I ordered the petal rose color but in the picture is a different band color. The band itself is kind of hard to get off at first, but after you know how to do it, it's a breeze. The screen is sharp but seems fragile! So I ordered a screen protector which I suggest you do when you order this watch. The accuracy seems on the mark, except the heart monitor, and the watch is customizable from the app. Theres lots of apps you can download, and pairing with your phone is an easy set up. One of the things I love most about this watch is once paired to your phone, you can use voice reply's or quick reply when replying back to a text message. This is one of the features I feel like people dont mention that often but is awesome if you're at work and can't be on your phone like me!",5
1,"I've worn the Fitbit Versa 2 for approximately 8 months. I like its size, convenience, battery power. Many of the features seem to work well. However, I'm not sure of its accuracy in each of the areas that it tracks because it consistently miscalculates the number of hours that I sleep. When I say miscalculates, I'm talking missing several hours of sleep altogether night after night. Now it's clear that it can't give you details on a patch of sleep that is less than 3 hours. However, when it doesn't even recognize that one is sleeping for several hours at a time, that is very disappointing. I've done my best to resolve the matter by checking instructions and reviews by the manufacturer and online. But none of it helps. So this is probably the last Fitbit I will purchase.",3
0,"I bought this watch for my wife and for awhile it worked fine. Just over a year since it was received, the button on the side of the watch stopped working. The technical department admitted it was an issue and referred me to the warranty department. They refused to do anything other than offer a 35% discount on a new one. After paying $200 for this item, I feel it should work longer than a year. I wouldn’t recommend it.",1
1,"I had some difficulty getting this setup, but once that was done, wit help from Fitbit support, It has been working great and I love it! I loaded about 2 hours of music into the built-in MP3 player and used it at the gym this morning. the 30 minutes on the treadmill went faster when I could listen to music and didn't have to carry a cell phone around with me, just the Fitbit Vista 2 and BlueTooth earbuds. Then when I get into the gym proper, I switch to weight lifting mode. I like the many clock faces with different features to choose from. I have tried 3 so far, looking for the one I like best. Great investment.",5
1,"So I have had my watch for just past 30 days and after doing some household chores noticed the glass is cracked. I looked on fitbit.com to see if they will fix it and they wont...I could have bought the warranty from amazon two days ago and it would have covered it. After having a smaller fitbit I was really excited to ""upgrade"" to the versa 2 and I was enjoying all the features- like controlling my music, apple pay etc but now it is junk sitting in my drawer because fitbit could care less and because I am an idiot... learn from my mistake!!",3
1,"The watch looks great however I notice it freezes a lot and has to be reset. Also many apps don't work without paid subscription. One of the main features I was excited to get was the leaderboard and it does not work, even after an update of the app it doesn't work. Issues remaining connected to the WiFi. The added ability to now store watch faces is a great improvement. I like Alexa on my wrist I only wish that this thing had audio and I could hear the answers etc",3
1,I bought this to track my workouts and for that purpose it is great. It gives you all the stats you need in a simple format. I did not buy this as a smart watch for messaging or calls. This watch is not that kind of watch. I see a good amount of people complain this watch doesn't do what the Samsung or Apple watch does and thats not its main focus. Fitbit has always been an exercise brand and they created this watch for the purpose of exercise. I do not pay for the premium and have not looked into it but for the workouts I do it tracks my stats well. I did get the dreaded rash that other complain about with the band but that is not uncommon and now I wash it much more regularly as well as remove it for a little bit each day which seemed to help. Overall I am impressed.,5
1,"I loved this Fit Bit Versa 2 smartwatch because it keeps a very accurate reading of my heart rate among other cool things. One other thing i really love about this watch is that there is a place on there that if your can't find your phone , you click on it and it starts your phone beeping. I lose my phone often and this feature is really nice. I recommend this Fit Bit Versa 2 if you are looking for a smart watch. Got mine in pink, but there are other colors to chose from.",5
0,"Cons:- When you receive it, no instructions. Shows Fitbit attitude of go figure it out yourself.- Not really bluetooth. Can't sync, add food, etc. if phone isn't online. and it doesn't tell you this, it just spins forever.- eats your phone battery. 100% charged at bed time, 0% 7.5 hours later with a message ""fitbit is using battery"". Normally phone is high 90's in the morning.- other than clock, font is microscopic with no zoom capability.- steps tracking inaccurate. sitting at a concert, noticed my steps were increasing, realized it was from clapping. Hold the applause!- graphs lack detail - time of day, count of items in bars. e.g. some are tagged AM, Noon, PM and you have to guess hours.- does not like to Sync: I get the message ""No device found"" about a dozen times or more before it decides to sync. I've read the pages and pages of complaints on this and how to restart and reboot about everything to get it to go away. Not acceptable.Pro's:- Nice to have a device on wrist to check the time. But I think there are cheaper ways to accomplish this.",1
0,"Update:The first fitbit I purchased was defective, after some time on the phone with Fitbit support I was able to get a replacement.My replacement took about 2 weeks to arrive. My new Fitbit is not fully functional. One of the big selling points of this device is the ability to respond to text messages. My new Fitbit does not alert me to texts or emails. After some time with Fitbit support I was told that I'd be added to a list of people who are having this same issue. When I asked how long they've had this problem they told me that they can't confirm that the issue I'm having is known. I was told to make sure to keep my app updated and not offered any additional assistance. Bottom line: The Versa 2 has software and/or hardware issues and Fitbit in no way backs their product.I've had this for just over a month and about 2 weeks in it started randomly restarting itself. This week my versa 2 started resetting multiple times a day. After a factory reset I'm still experiencing the same issue.The one big reason I choose the Fitbit over a smart watch was because I didnt want to pay for data, but many of the features of the Versa 2 are only available with an additional monthly subscription price that's roughly equal to my cell carriers data fee for a smart watch, so honestly I don't feel like the Versa 2 is a great value compared to a fully functioning smart watch.",1
1,"I recently started a new job as an Optometry Technician and my supervisor recommended that I get a Fitbit to wear to work. This is a product I never knew I needed in my life until I started using it. I absolutely love it. It makes knowing the time while I am at work easier than before as well as having access to a timer on my wrist. When I need to set a timer after administering dilation drops, this watch makes it so easy to do so and to keep track of how many steps I am getting in each day as well. I can't imagine not having this watch now that I have it. I use it everyday when I'm at work and even a few of my co-workers have bought this watch after they saw me using mine each day. Highly recommend this Fitbit smartwatch.",5
0,"I wanted this device for sleep tracking. It consistently shows less than 2 hours of sleep, night after night. I called when I first got the device, and was guided through a reset and told to give it a week. Two weeks later it isn't any better. Customer service not helpful when I called again. 20 minutes on the phone again, because the on-line chat doesn't even seem to be a thing. ""We'll send you an email with some directions to follow. Not sure when you will get that."" Maybe they will make me wait another week to see if it works?",2
1,"This is a good fitness tracker. HR, steps, floors measurement are mostly accurate. Sleep measurement is just OK. Many times if I am sitting and watching TV before sleeping, it is counted as ""sleep"". Screen is ok and the battery life is great. The number of watch faces is limited, and none of the watch faces can be customized. Exercise tracking and connected GPS seem to work well.But the Versa2 can barely be called a smartwatch. Notifications are more miss than hit. And I found no way to fix this behavior. It seems random. There are no notifications for calls on Whatsapp or Facebook messenger. There are hardly any apps.So if you are looking for fitness tracker with a large display, go for the Versa 2. If you are looking for a smartwatch do not waste your money.",3
1,"I've had this a week, and so far, I like it. I'm coming from a Wear OS device and this is actually a much better experience.The watch is comfortable, seems to be accurate enough for my purposes and provides the notifications that I want to receive. It really feels strange not too worry about whether the phone charge will deplete before the end of a day. I don't wear it at night, so can't speak to the sleep tracking. all the other functionality is as good or better than my Wear OS device. I'm happy with the purchase!Update: it's been 6 months and I still like it. Notifications work, it automatically tracks my workouts, and the battery life has been really good. I will continue to use it.",5
1,"This review is for the Fitbit Versa 2 Health and Fitness Tracker. This is not my first fitness tracker. I bought this tracker largely for the sleep tracking feature. I am also interested in the fitness features that tract daily steps and some workout routines. As most other fitness trackers, It does show your heart heart. This is an important feature for me because I am an AFib. and do pay careful attention to my heart rate. It will give you a fairly detailed reading of the amount of time and the stages of your sleep. It will also give you a sleep score. This is good. This appears to be fairly accurate. My previous fitness tracker gave me a score for my blood oxygen level also. This tracker does not give a numerical score but shows your sleep breathing variation levels on a graph. I liked the number better than the graph. With this tracker, I am unable to get an indication of my highest and lowest heart rate readings while I am asleep. Otherwise, it is comfortable to wear. I have been wearing it for about 3 weeks and it has not irritated my wrist. My skin is very sensitive. A great feature is the length of time that it keeps a charge- honestly, about 4-5 days. I do not play music or use some of the other features. I wear it all the time, removing it for charging about once weekly. I do not wear it in the shower. You can upgrade to a premium package and get more features. However, there is a monthly fee after a three months trial. Overall,it is a pretty good device. I wish I could give it five stars.",4
1,"I love this watch as a fitness augmentation. It has the capacity to not only guide my workouts, but give me great telemetries on workouts I have completed.Some reviews complained that the Versa 2 relies too much on the app, but I prefer looking at, and downloading apps on my phone. I would rather read a sufficient description with pictures on a readable screen, rather than try to browse for apps on the admittedly cumbersome screen on the device itself. This isn't a bad thing either, it's a watch, it's not meant for browsing, it's meant for important, curated information at a glance.This is also where I have to dock a star, and it's not the fault of the watch itself; but the fault of the choice of virtual assistant. This watch comes equipped with Amazon's Alexa. Which is great for my kitchen where I'm primarily playing music and setting timers, but I wouldn't think to use it for my phone (which a smart watch is essentially and auxiliary display for. It can only set reminders and timers on this watch: I can't send texts, reply to texts, or even read texts after I see the notification.I admittedly have a little envy for my girlfriend's apple watch, which I can't get since I'm on Android. She can see texts, send them, and reply with ease with Siri. And I think the answer to making this the ideal smart watch for me would be to simply add google assistant to the fitbit app store. Considering FitBit is now owned by Google, it makes sense to put their first party (and superior in this particular application) software on the watches. I don't even want Wear OS; I like this operating system on here, it's obviously refined for what they want it to do, it's simply lacking a competent assistant.I get that Google doesn't want to potentially cannibalize their own Wear OS options, but I think FitBit losing out on what should be a vital part of being a smart watch is a bit unfortunate. If this watch had the google assistant capability it would be the best smart watch on the market for me. Burt as it stands, I feel like I need this for working out, and I'd need to get a Wear OS for my normal Smart Watch needs.",4
1,"Just a few pics of some of the applications loaded and available.My pros:Ease of useLarge readable touch screenMultiple choices in watch face options to choose from.Accuracy level is about midway with some lag recording walks, runs and hikes.WaterproofBattery last 7 days before rechargeMy Cons:On occasion my bluetooth connection will drop, I have a Samsung Galaxy S8+.Text messages come through however reply does not always reciprocate.All in all I enjoy using this device and the applications. The App works for all my health needs and was more affordable than buying the Samsung Watch I had originally intended on purchasing",5
1,"Take all data with a grain of salt. This works well for comparing with yourself. Terrible stats in high humidity such as the shower, swimming pool, sauna and warm tropical islands. Lousy swim monitoring. I always have to delete my swim workout and re enter it manually. It cant count laps as well as the original Versa before the last update.This is my third FitBit in the last four years. I gave my last two away as they were still working as well as ever. Great customer service but lousy software. Over 100 cal difference between 2 miles and 2.1? They just will not correct this.As good a sleep tracker as the other two I use which stay in the bed.I am a white female. I’ve heard that these work best with that group from one reputable news source.",4
0,"Bought this watch as a birthday gift for my friend who had to spend all day trying to get the WiFi on the watch the work. The best help we got from customer suppprt was to reset the watch 5 times. The phone app is also super unintuitive. And you can’t set up all the features on the phone app, you need to use a computer. In addition, none of the experience is any better than the Fitbit blaze from two years ago. We ended up replacing the Fitbit with a garmin vivoactive which took like 5 minutes to set up.",1
1,"I have been a Fitbit Blaze user for the last 3 years. My Blaze battery died. Unfortunately, Fitbit does not do anything to help. They offer a 25% discount for buying another fitbit, which is a sad thing on the company's part. That is why I pulled down one star from the rating.Having said that, Versa 2 is a great product. Very good finish and looks. It tracks all the health and sleep parameters really well. Integration with the apps on iphone like Whatsapp, Messenger, calendar etc is good. Best of all is it's battery life, which goes whooping 5 days. I have a apple smartwatch in my house too, which is also as good except that it's battery lasts only 1 day (max 1.5).",4
0,"I am so tired of having Fitbit products that work for a few months and then turn to crap. My recent purchase of a Versa is proof enough that I haven't learned from past mistakes when I bought an HR and then a Blaze. Eventually, they stop holding a charge, the ""steps"" and ""flights"" don't track accurately, the programs don't work properly and the button on the side stops functionally properly so that you can no longer navigate programs. Fitbit products are designed to suck you in for awhile and then start to disintegrate so that you buy an upgraded version. I GIVE UP! I'm looking at an Apple or other smart watch. Fitbit has taken too much of my money!",1
1,"I was debating between this and an Apple Watch and I am so happy that I stuck with Fitbit. Not only was it more affordable. But I personally like the ergonomics of it more than the Apple Watch. A lot simpler and feels more like a watch.It’s pretty accurate from steps to sleep. Fitbit is definitely good at what they do. Also, I love how durable the screen is. Not a single scratch and I’ve had it for a few months now.The only thing I don’t love is that you have to have your Fitbit app up to use Alexa. And, to track your distance ran you also have to have the app open for a more detailed exercise report.Overall, I love it!!",5
1,"I love this product and use it a lot. However, I had to take it off today because my wrist is burned. I washed dishes last night so I'm wondering if it's from dish detergent getting trapped under the band. I'm hoping that I can go back to wearing it once my wrist heals. I'll add to this review if it happens again.",3
0,"I spent two hours working to get the fitbit to connect to I phone 10, called fit bit support who was very nice but apologize for software glitch and told me to return it back to amazon. The watch itself is very nice looking and love the limited edition band, was perfect. Unfortunately the New Versa 2 has software glitches and programs do not work and will not work with Iphone 10. Too bad a product looks great.",1
1,"I know the newer version is out, but I'm glad I stuck with this one. I love it. I really wanted something to help me get back on track. Just knowing what my count is for my steps have been helpful. It's insane what ""active"" is considered and I haven't achieved a fraction, so it really helps me get off my butt lol. It has some pretty cool features. I can read text messages from my Iphone off of it. Can't respond back, but that's ok. I don't need to. I love watching my sleep tracking as well. After my 2nd kid started sleeping through the night, I thought I was getting back to normal sleep. Looks like I'm averaging about 5-6 hours, which is not ok in the long run. It's something to work on. I love the watch and the color I chose. I've had it for a couple months now. Would definitely recommend.",5
0,It is sad to say the Versa 2 is a failure. After 2 weeks the apps on the fitbit site stopped working. No messages no weather etc. I have to take the app off my IPhone 12 reboot. and hope for the best. Last time I did this I ot it up and running after 3 reboots and over an hour of trying. Guess what happened the next day. Nothing it went back to failure mode. I saw that you can contact seller but when I tries I got an error message. Sound appropriate for this problem watch.,1
1,"Just got this today, and it was a little frustrating trying to get it set up. There were no instructions included, and I had to find the set up on the site. Once that was finished, however, it was smooth sailing. I am in love with the features this watch has. You can change the clock face, set reminders, and even use spotify, which I found very easy to set up. I know some other people had problems with that last one, but I want people to know that it was likely the specific device issue and not an issue with the model as a whole. Very easy tracking, and a fun accessory to help you get in shape. Thanks!",5
1,"Weight: Sometimes I have to double check that it's still on my wrist-- I forget I'm wearing it.Battery: Lasts 2-3 days, probably more, I only have to charge when I shower. (It's water proof, but I need to charge it at some point right?)App: Works well enough, premium version is too expensive, missing some features some other free apps have. Can sync with them but not super easilySleep tracking: Without a doubt tracks REM correctly. It shows I have REM when I remember having dreams. (Obviously I can't reliably say that for every REM, but the ones that occur near wakeups)Alexa Integration: KINDA slow, but overall works. Does require mobile phone connection. Comparing it to a leading competitor it's vastly superior.",5
1,"I love EVERYTHING about this so far. No, I havent had it but about 2 weeks, but this was/is my very first fitness tracker. I was so nervous about picking the right one, it took me DAYS to figure out which one I'd be happy with, and I worried for nothing.I love that I can monitor my sleep each night and review it the next day, and I am definitely moving much more every day now. It helps with reminders and I need that now that I am no longer working.I may need a different band once the hot weather comes but it shouldn't be a problem.I bought the rose gold I believe it's called and it was worththe extra $ as it's a beautiful watch. Love the color!! Love the features!",5
0,"It light and easy to wearAfter five months parts of the touch screen stopped working. Fitibit was unresponsive when I asked for help. There is an online fitibit forum that says this is a common problem.The heart rate accuracy is mixed. Sometimes it is spot on with my wahoo tickr chest band. Other times it's off by ten or more BPM.The activity tracking is lacking.The step counts are ok, but that isn't why I got it.Their app used to be one of the best, but not anymore. The apps from Apple, Samsung and even Garmin have surpassed it. I was thinking of getting a Versa 3, but their reviews are even worse.",2
1,I love this watch but after I got attacked by a dog and the dog broke my watch (have had it for less than 3 months) I contacted Fitbit to see about getting it fixed (cause somehow when I ordered it the warranty did not go thru) and they said they could not fix it. I really enjoy the watch and it saved me from the dog breaking the skin when it attacked me but now I can’t really use it cause the screen is all cracked. Just wish Fitbit could of been more helpful in getting it fixed.,4
1,"Attached a summary of 4 days swimming. I do 22 laps in a 25 yard pool or 550 yards. As the screen short shows the Fitbit recorded a range of 679 to 793 yards. The only reasonable accurate measurement is the time. Good luck with changing the band as I have to watch a YouTube video every time and expect to break a finger nail at least once. The faces available or just OK. I had trouble like others getting started, absolutely nothing in the box on how to use it, update it, etc. Download the app and use the add device to get started and be prepared for a long wait while it's updated.I paid $149 and I see it's up $50, wouldn't have paid that much for it.Overall I do like it even with the shortcomings noted above.",4
1,"Top of the list of things I like is the positive reinforcement for reaching a goal. Admittedly, this device is right up my alley. Tracking water and food intake is no big deal for me and has become routine in a very short time. The sleep module and health metrics fascinate me. I was even able to integrate my scale. My sleep score is the first thing I check in the morning. My weight loss can be attributed in part due to wearing this Fitbit.Now for what I don't like.. the constant request ""Always to track exercise with GPS"" NO THANKS MEANS NO.Also, there is an option to track mindfulness which is nice but the options are negligible unless you upgrade to Premium and there is no way to track Meditation or Mindfulness sessions not included with Fitbit.I really hate companies that try to nickel and dime their customers; either have it available or don't have it at all.Even with some of the features I don't like, I still give it 5 Stars.",5
0,"This had been an awesome watch/ computer. But it turned into a brick today and it made me sad. Their warranty is good for 1 year. So at $215 I would have expected better...If I had purchased this in Europe, the warranty would have been valid until 2 years from date of purchase. This makes no sense to me why they all aren't warranty'd the same way. So here I go to purchase another one. This time I'll buy the extended warranty...For the price I would have expected it to last a lot longer! It is well taken care of...",2
0,"The watch is great 90% of the time. However the reason I got the watch was for monitoring work outs. When you put the watch into work out mode, it will jump your heart rate by about 50 beats per minute, even if you are just sitting in a chair. When in workout mode even if your actual heart rate is maybe 90 it will say it's between 140 and 150. Once you turn off work out mode it drops the heart rate back to an accurate reading. Do NOT get this watch if you are going to use if for working out. I returned the first watch thinking I got a defective one but the second one did the same thing. sI did contact Fitbit and it is a known bug which they have no idea when the fix will come in. I am giving this review two stars instead of one due to Fitbit's being honest that it is an issue and the ease of returns with Amazon.Here is the response from Fitbit:""Thanks for letting us know about the issue you're experiencing with your Fitbit Versa 2. We’re aware of it, but may not be able to provide a fix in the immediate future. We'll continue to monitor the situation, and keep our team informed of the impact to you and other customers. We understand that this isn't the resolution you're hoping for, but rest assured we're always working to improve our products.""When asking what the next step is here is Fitbit's response:""In regards the return, please check the refund options with Amazon as the device wasn't purchased directly from our store. A replacement will not fix the issue as it's a bug that relies on the Fitbit application you could experience it again even with a new device. """,2
1,"I totally dislike that they don't last long. I have bought really good ones twice. Before I even got a year on each one, the battery apparently goes bad because they won't hold a charge. I was told on the first one that a year was pretty good. It went totally dead. After some time, I bought a Versa 2 when it came out because I do really like the Fitbit features. They just don't last! Almost a year to the day, they're toast.... Really need to do something about this. A person should be able to replace the battery. I am throwing really nice stuff away! I won't be buying from Fitbit again. Sorry...",3
1,"Bought this as an upgrade from my Charge 2 which was very reliable. After some hassles with the shipping, it finally arrived and I have been mostly pleased with it. The ability to choose various clock faces and apps to install was a great upgrade from the no nonsense Charge 2. With features like that however, you sacrifice battery life although there are several things you can do to try and minimize the issue such as adjusting screen brightness and notification settings etc.. when compared to the Charge 2 the battery life leaves something to be desired. I get about 3 1/2 - 4 days out of mine whereas as I was getting 5 1/2 - 6 days out of the Charge 2. All that said, having a greater ability to customize and run apps as well as Alexa is a super nice perk. As others have reported I also have an issue with the battery not charging past 99%. What I have found that works is to drain the battery completely before charging it. Then I get 100%. Anyway, all in all I am really happy with it.",4
0,"I wanted to buy a fitness tracker long time ago, reason why I got the Fitbit Versa 2. The first thing I did was to change my android phone, since the Fitbit Versa 2 was not compatible with the Samsung galaxy model I had. I got an iPhone and i started to download the Fitbit app but I encounter the following issues:1- the weather app was not working and after I contacted the Fitbit customer service number they guided me and help me with the issue.2- after the issue with the weather app I was not able to get notifications, I made a second phone call to Fitbit customer service, problem solved.3- after the weather and notification issue then I couldn’t get any emails at this point I think you know what is next. A third phone call to Fitbit customer service.4- inaccurate data, the results of the fitness tracker were not correct for example; my period cycle, and the amount of steps. This time I decided to call customer service again and they say that in order for me to change the information recorded on the Fitbit app I have to contact them and maybe they will be able to change it for me, something that I honestly did not like. The Fitbit Versa 2 device has a lot of connectivity issues and I believe the company should make the effort to offer a product of quality to the customers. The device needs to be improved and also to change the watch face more free apps should be offered.",1
0,I bought this watch only because Pandora was supposed to be able to work with it. I am a Pandora subscriber and Fitbit claims to be able to download your offline Pandora stations to the watch for listening from the watch. THIS IS NOT TRUE. The watch refuses to download anything. Hours spent with Fitbit support and Pandora Support was worthless. DO NOT BUY if you want Pandora to work on the watch. IT WILL NOT WORK.,1
0,"Bought this in 12/2019 and began wearing it 01/01/20. I had no problems with it for the first 16 months. Then charging the battery became a problem. I would hook it up and 8 hours later it had charged only10 - 15%. I would get a message showing that there was not enough power from the power source. I assumed the charging cradle was defective and bought another but the same thing happened with the new cradle. I read ""Why isn't my Fitbit device's battery charging?"" on the Fitbit site. I followed all suggestions and nothing changed. Now it will not charge at all. I have owned a Fitbit One since 2014 and it still works with no problem. I expected that the reliability of the Versa would be more like that. I've read entries in the Fitbit Community about the Versa charging problem and it looks like if the product is no longer under warranty, you're out of luck. My faith in Fitbit is destroyed. I will be looking for another company's product in the future. I gave this 2 stars because I really liked the product for the first 16 months of use.",2
0,"I wanted it to do two things--share my heart rate with other fitness tracker programs (e.g. Endomondo) and track my sleep. It shares everything but heart rate with other programs, but not that.Other than that, it seems to be an inaccurate step tracker, tell me that my overall calories burned in a day is ridiculously high, and serve as a digital watch.Only thing it adds to info I don't already have is resting heart rate and the sleep tracking, which worked ok.It's basically trying to do everything and doing nothing well. It would stop in the middle of workout tracking with a vibration and you'd have to start over.If you want a glorified, inaccurate step tracker this product is for you.",1
0,"Bought this for my wife, as she has a fitbit charge HR a few years ago and liked it. After opening it we realized it still had a charging cradle that the watch had to physically connect to since it has no wireless charging like our samsung and apple watches. Cant make or take calls on it. Limited functionality unless you pay for fitbits subscription service what is pathetic. Unless you like throwing away your money on underwhelming products I advise you to stay away from this one. Fitbit can do better and at a $150 price tag it should include way more features and functionality.",1
1,"I like the Fitbit Versa 2, I do wish it had a smaller face. I have a very small wrist and it looks super big. I finally decided to keep it because I like that it lays flat on my wrist. I tried the smaller Inspire and Inspire 2 and for whatever reason they are thicker and I don't like how there is a gap on the sides.The Versa 2 is very easy to connect to the app, easy to read, along with my iPhone it tracks my route and gives me all the numbers I need.Just so you know I am a senior and started walking again last July and have increased over that period of time to 4-5 miles in good summer weather and at least 3-3.5 on the winter months.",5
0,"This is my 3rd replacement device in less than two years. The first one was purchased brand new and the face popped off after 6 months. The replacement Fitbit sent died after 3 months (screen went black, couldn’t be charged or turned on). This time it took 6 weeks for a replacement after they completed an “investigation”. 7 months later, and the face popped off of the new device. I was offered a discount code to apparently purchase more faulty hardware? What a joke. I’ve been a loyal Fitbit customer for over a decade but I’m officially done. They have seemingly designed this device knowing it has critical errors and requiring people repurchase after a year. They’ve lost a customer, and I warn potential buyers to pass on this model.",1
0,"1 Star because I put less. The watch died after 3 weeks. Battery ran out the blue Fitbit logo came on screen during charging and is now frozen with the logo. The same thing happened to my Fitbit Ionic earlier this year just after the warranty expired by 2 months.If you search online for ""Fitbit Versa 2 logo frozen"" you will find multiple complaints since 2018 on this same issue on both Versa and Versa 2 and Ionic. It seems like Fitbit has stopped answering the complaints on their community boards. Lots of upset people including my wife and I. I switched to Samsung Galaxy Smartwatch. Returning this one and getting her the Samsung Active 2 watch wich just dropped in price comparable now to Fitbit. We don't own iPhones so no need for expensive Apple Watch. Be warned! Goodbye Fitbit...",1

I have no other resource at this time except to put this information out there for those who are thinking about purchasing a Fitbit product so you can make an informed choice.",1
0,"The one-star review is for the awful customer service from Fitbit. I started having issues with battery life and swipe/tap features after three months, so I contacted them via online chat. I got some suggestions about resetting the watch and letting the battery completely drain so they could see what was happening, which didn't fix the problems. I've uploaded the same video three times at their request showing that the swipe and tap don't work. I've also requested a replacement under warranty. I keep getting replies about resetting the watch, turning it on and off (hello, doesn't work if swipe and tap aren't working), and uploading a video showing them that it doesn't work.My Charge HR lasted about 18 months, and my Charge 2 is still working, but I'm ready to switch to an Apple watch at this point.",1

No maual included. If you want to change a setting, you have to either go to the app, website, or watch. It's never clear where to change anything, you just have to toggle around forever. Then when you get to the settings, customer service told me to change it, then sync on the app. But the website won't allow the change to get inputted in the first place. The charger is very awkward. It sits on the side because a cable comes straight out the bottom. Im returning after 3 days. Going back to Samsung smart watch.",2
1,"I love this watch. I've tried quite a few fitbits and this is by far my favorite. I would give just about anything for them to do something about the awful rash the band causes though. This is definitely not a new issue and I feel like ""dont wear it"" is not an appropriate response. I keep my arm dry & clean. I still experience this rash if I dont swap out the band. Considering I bought the one I did because I loved the band color and had hoped they maybe fixed this I was disappointed to find out they have not.tldr: great product, band sucks. Go ahead and order you a $10 replacement.",3
0,"I'm a long time fitbit user (3-4 years now), but I'm finally giving it up. I had a couple fitbit alta's before and was happy with it, then one day it stopped charging. I decided to upgrade to the Versa 2 which has a screen display. I really like having a screen however, after less than 2 months of having it the screen function has stopped working. I cannot swipe to see my stats or use the apps available on the Versa. I've written to fitbit and their response was not helpful (i.e. charge it, turn it off and on again) and my screen is still broken. I cannot get a refund because its after 45 days of buying it.Second, a huge problem with this fitbit model is that the band is TERRIBLY HARD TO CHANGE! I had so much trouble with it and so did several of my friends. It's not something you can change easily if you want to switch out colors or band style on a regular basis.Please do not buy this and make the mistake I did.",1
0,i got the amazon special edition with fancy band. minus one star because the fancy band gets soaked with water and stays wet and makes my skin wrinkly. I switched to the cheap plastic band. minus one star because it pauses while doing walking exercise and does not continue and thus loses most of the walk tracking. minus one star because of zero integration with Apple health — Zero nada nothing. I might switch back to my Polar which worked great with Apple health and the UnderArmor apps like MapMyFitness.,2
0,"I guess I just don't understand why, after all these years (my 3rd Fitbit), they haven't worked on getting this thing to sync properly and consistently. My app rarely agrees with my watch and awards me dozens of unearned flights of stairs each day. I get a few thousand steps sitting at my desk each day as well. I don't mind the inaccuracies too much as long as they are consistent and allow for benchmarking. Perhaps the tech for accurate step count and stair count doesn't exist, but I'm sure it's possible to sync these things. I won't be buying another one.",2
0,"I was loving my fitbit Versa 2 for the almost-month I've had it--until I noticed that it was only counting steps sporadically, and wouldn't count them accurately. Sometimes I'd see delays in the steps, and sometimes no steps would be counting at all. I searched online for fixes, and performed all of the basic ones (resetting, changing the clock face, checking for updates, etc). Today, my Fitbit is not counting steps at all, which is when I decided I'd return it. I'm opting for a replacement, and my review will either reflect a positive or negative outcome. Hoping for the best, as I was really liking my Fitbit until I encountered this -- apparently -- common issue.",1
1,Although I still do not it programed for my music or hooked up to Alexa I am very pleased with how the watch works. I had another fit bit tracker that worked fine but I couldn't read it outside and I needed to be able to read the time outside. The display on the versa is great. No more trying to find shade to read it. I only gave it a 4 for accuracy because it tends to say I rode an outdoor bike and I have never rode an outdoor but it does give me credit for doing something. Worth the price.,5
1,"This is my third and favorite fitbit I’ve bought over the past few years. I love how it tracks everything from steps to calories to sleep. So much cheaper than an Apple Watch! I do have one big complaint though: my watch will go through phases where it won’t send notifications. Not from Instagram, texts, calls, emails, etc. This actually happened with my old Ionic and I was hoping this watch wouldn’t carry over the same issue. I’ve gone through IT and set up all my settings as I should, but still run into issues. I end up having to restart my watch or uninstall the app completely to fix it. It’s not a deal breaker, but is very inconvenient. I also wish the Home Screen would fit the picture to the whole screen. It’s a weird layout, but that’s an aesthetic pet peeve.",3
0,"The media could not be loaded.
 I've had this thing for a year and a half. The first one stopped working within 4 months and I got it replaced. The second one just stopped working again within the last week. First the touch screen stops working now the screen is white and flickering. I contacted fitbit and because they only give you a one year warranty I'm out of luck. They're generously offering me 35% off a new product. Like I'm about to drop another $150 on a crap product that can't even make it two years. Disgusting. Do not recommend.",1
1,"I love this watch for basic fitness tracking! The band pictured is a third party band but the original band is very comfortable and the plum color goes with everything. Screen movement is very smooth and doesn’t lag. All tracked stats are very accurate. Exercise mode has so many options to choose from. Seems to be splash proof. I hand wash all my dishes and wear my watch through it all. I haven’t submerged it, but soapy splashes haven’t affected it at all. It lets me see all my texts and pick up or decline phone calls. It connects to Spotify and allows you to do everything except adjust volume. I haven’t used the Alexa feature yet. Weather app is fantastic, it uses AccuWeather. The app has lots of clock faces to choose from. Download the FitFace clock face, it has TONS of options on it that aren’t in the Fitbit clock store.",5
0,"There are so many great features, but you have to pay to do a lot of them. Cannot connect Pandora unless you pay for the Pandora Premium. Cannot connect to Spotify unless you pay for Spotify Premium.The heart rate monitor is off. I was running at a fast pace on the treadmill and it told me that my heart rate was in the 150ish range the whole time. The treadmill said 170ish and my other fitness watch w/ chest heart rate monitor said 170ish. Experience (with my body and how it feels when I push it) also tells me that my heart rate was definitely not 150.The charging station is awkward and doesn't lay flat. I've been looking at cases to keep the item safe and none seem to work with the design of the charging station.I have had it for two days. I fully charged it and today is my first full day of use. It's already down to 70%.It's not syncing with MyfitnessPal at all. I have tried to problem solve this with the help page. It's ready to go and it just doesn't sync.Overall, I am incredibly dissapointed. I was soo excited for this watch and it's just a huge dissapointment. The only thing redeeming is the sleep data.",2
0,"In general, I liked the product. My issue is that the display died (Scrambled and illegible, see picture) after just 13 months, just outside the warranty period. Seems coincidental! There is NO visible damage on the unit. I don't even wear it in the shower or pool. Very disappointing. Fitbit offered a discount to buy a new unit, but they are discounting off their assessed MSRP, not what the unit is being sold for by them and every other vendor.",1
1,"Disappointing if upgrading from older models. No more active minutes. Now active zone minutes which are designed for higher level athletes not those focused on getting fit. Discouraging! (would be fine if app allowed a toggle between the two).Navy silicon band is not compatible. Too thick and wide. I do like the new SPO2 feature for better heart, sleep, and breathing monitoring. Going active problem solved soon to allow toggling. Disappointed",4
1,"I LOVE THIS SMART WATCH!!!! Especially the sleep tracker. And- flappy bird app!? Uhhh, yay!! Lol. The phone app is set up pretty well, but can be kind of confusing. I caught on pretty good, as I'm a big tech-y person.What I dislike- battery drains quickly. I get maybe 3 days, with light/medium use. Also, as seen in my 3 photos, I wound up with the burn/rash. Everywhere the band touched my skin, burned/rash! I had to wrap my wrist with gauze and neosporin. (It triggered my anxiety (SH free for over a year.)) I ended up ripping the gauze off in the middle of the night. I need a fabric band. Silicone bands felt amazing though! Very comfy!",4

1,"Had my Fitbit Blaze for years. After several accidents, it was time to replace it. I was shocked to find the Blaze no longer in production. After researching, I decided on the Versa 2. Reviews didn't care for the charging station. I love the charging station with the fact that you don't have to remove the watch from the band to charge it....super easy. Also bad reviews for changing the bands. If you can't change these bands in seconds, then you must have a desk job with no mechanical abilities at all. Love my new watch. Add the music, what is there not to love?",5
1,"I bought 2 for my son and daughter at Christmas and decided to buy one for myself after learning about all the available features. It has helped me keep track of my sleep, activity, food, and fluids which has helped me tremendously with identifying patterns in health issues. My doctors were impressed with my health improvements since getting the watch ad have the readily available information to easily identify patterns with sleep, activity, food, and fluids.I wear it all the time.... in the pool, the shower, out in the garden, out for a walk. I like that I don't need to have my phone glued to my hip 24/7.I have recommended this watch to several people now.We have 3 happy Fit Bit Versa wearers in the family now",5
1,"I really suck at getting back to people promptly, however this watch changed the game! Now that I get a buzz on my wrist for reminders, calendar events, calls, and texts...it's so much easier to remember to follow through! Comfortable fit and cool stats to check out. Sleep stats are meh unless you subscribe for more $$. Just a heads up!Some notes: If I download alternate watch styles on the display...they seem to not be as good at tracking my movement for some reason.",5
0,"My $20 knockoff is 100% accurate as a pedometer, but this expensive ""smart"" watch is far from. So far, I've only found it useful in asking Alexa what the date is 14 (or 30 or 28, etc.) days from today so as to know open-vial expiration dates in the lab. I'm going to try and download some Music on my computer this weekend, as I don't (and won't) have a paid subscription to Pandora or Spotify. Sleep tracker has worked 2 of the 3 nights I've worn it, so again, not awesome (but the sleep tracker on my knockoff seems to think everyone should be awake by 0900 in the morning, which leaves us shift workers out in the cold so at least the Versa 2 sorta works for us). If it hadn't been available at a Black Friday price I would be sending it back.",2
0,"Let me just start off by saying I loved this watch. The app interface was super user friendly and helpful! I loved the step tracking, heart rate zones, calorie tracker, and sleep trends. It was very stylish and similar in appearance to an apple watch without the hefty price tag. I guess now I am realizing that you get what you pay for.. I had a coworker before I bought this watch who told me that she loved her previous fitbit watches, but each one she bought only lasted for about a year. This happened with 3 of them, but I didn't listen and bought one anyway. I realized this afternoon that my watch was no longer charging when I put it on the charger. I tried again this evening with still no success even after multiple restarts, plugging the charger into different outlets, etc. Thinking back to what my coworker had told me, I looked back on my previous orders and I realized that I purchased this watch on October 14th, 2020.... A FEW DAYS SHY OF EXACTLY 1 YEAR AFTER I BOUGHT IT... So disappointing because I actually really enjoyed this watch, but I will not be purchasing anymore fit bit watches in the future unless they can fix this issue.",1
0,"5/11/2020 UPDATE: Alright Fitbit, you guys really need to develop some kind of update. If every time I try to open one of the apps on my watch, it tells me to check the bluetooth connection on my phone (when it's already connected,) it defeats the whole purpose of having the watch!!!Truthfully, owning one of these really isn’t necessary. I’ve noticed that the app is counting me typing/moving my hand as steps. When I wake up in the morning, it has a number of steps counted, so apparently it’s counting my tossing and turning as steps. Definitely not accurate.In addition, anytime I try to use any of the apps on the watch it says connecting. Or worse, to connect via Bluetooth on my phone every time I want to use it. Doesn’t that defeat the whole purpose? Makes no sense why it isn’t automatically recognizing that it’s linked and connected already.",2
1,"I bought this Fitbit on June 23, 2020. It stopped working completely yesterday, Oct 10, 2020. I have had several Fitbits that have lasted for years not months. I know the return window has ended but I am a faithful customer of Amazon. I need my Fitbit replaces because I use it daily for my fitness routine. I wish I had checked out all the poor rating for this Fitbit. I am thinking about the Apple Watch. Not happy about this poor quality from Fitbit.",5
1,I like Fitbit watches but they only last for about 2 years before they stop working. This particular devices face went black but the backlight was still lit. I put it in a drawer and it somehow reset itself but the screen doesn't respond to touches as it previously did.,3
1,"If you turn off the always on and set it to where you have to press to turn on, it will last a little over a week on one charge! Great fit bit, but a must is to get the tpu screen protector that covers the whole face of the watch. Charges fast. Time will tell if it last longer than the Fitbit charge 3. The Fitbit charge 3 always went bad in under a year time will tell if this last longer. You can see this in the sun when out and about. Great fit bit!",5
0,"I bought this heart rate monitor to view my heart rate during vigorous exercise. It’s an abysmal failure as a heart rate monitor. The display is not continuous, so when doing high intensity interval training HR not visible. Very dangerous! Also will not allow me to track my own HIIT protocol, which alternates 2 minutes of very low intensity followed by 2 minutes of intense exercise (steep inclines). Nor can I see my heart rate when riding my bicycle. I have to pull over to the side of the street, pound on the watch face before the heart rate display will reappear. The Fitbit is really just a data-gathering device for the company. It is not safe. Thank heavens I have a $15 pulse ox I can use to monitor my HR during HIIT.",2
1,"Update. After a year, I've down graded to 2 stars. It keeps losing its bt connection. I have to constantly pair the bt connection. Also since Google owns fitbit, Alexa doesn't work on the watch. Not happy!Love the new style and look. Tried premium but never used it as much as it was worth. The free stuff is very informative. Love the Alexa feature and adding health symptoms. I wish I could add other daily info like mood, blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol along with health symptoms. Overall a nice watch and I really like the Alexa app features, timers and alarms. Well done Fitbit!",3
1,"I like the features of the Versa 2 is supposed to come with, but the display stopped working after 3 months. Fitbit customer service was good (after a fairly long hold time) and they did replace it, but it took a few weeks to get my replacement. They did take care of shipping costs to return my defective Versa, which I appreciated. Replacement is working good so far. One thing I am disappointed about is that it is supposed to be equipped with Alexa, however, it doesn't work. I have the Versa 2 connected to my wifi, but it doesn't seem to be able to connect to Alexa. Also, the wrist band connectors are not very user friendly compared to other Fitbit models I've used.",3
1,"I got this watch in December around Christmas, I love the design and features compared to the Charge 2. I wear it for every workout and literally never take it off. About 3 weeks ago the charge started to last less and less time and the battery died very quickly and finally last night it stopped charging all together. I got online and was able to a chat with their support bot which was surprisingly easy and within 5-7 min they had approved a replacement for defect and I'll have a new watch face in 5- 7 days. Which seems like an eternity but the process and service was top notch and frankly will make me keep coming back for more Fitbit products. This is how you keep customers for life.",4
1,"I have 1 day left to decide if I will return.I’ll start with, have always loved fitbit. Loved my Versa2 when I got it. But read reviews on fitbit forums before purchasing. I didn’t do my best research as I was grabbing a sale on amazon. I don’t have all the issues, but now cannot download any apps or watch faces. For over a week. I have a “smart watch” that isn’t really smart.Check out conversations in fitbit forums. Just google the topic (e.g., notifications, or syncing, or whatever). Find out what owners are saying.Sad that Fitbit isn’t providing what it has in past. And not resolving issues. And shame on me for not doing all the research I should have done.Don’t be me :)",3
0,"PROS:Monitored heart rate wellApp gave some unique features like sleep trackingComfortable fitCONS:Broke almost immediately after warranty expiredDid not track footsteps correctly; under countedApp was cumbersome to use and insisted on upsellingOVERALL EXPERIENCEThis smart watch did what I bought it for; it tracked my heart rate through the course of each day, however, the watch's screen went black a day or two after the one year warranty expired and the fixes available on the internet did nothing to fix the issue.The cost of this item was not worth what I expected. The step tracking was inaccurate and was not close to the actual number, the app for the smartphone was severely lacking as it was not very intuitive and one needs to go through several steps to get to where you need to go; such as the site where you change the phone face. The app would also almost insist on tracking my locations as all times with a ubiquitous pop up window.I would never buy this watch again due to it's value-one year for nearly $200 is abysmal and I should have just purchased a low cost heart monitor",1
1,Love this Fitbit! I was forced to retire my Fitbit zip as it just was not working and syncing as it used to and moved to the Versa 2. I moved with hesitation due to NOT wanting to wear a fitness tracker on my wrist. Regardless I surrendered to this and bought myself the Versa on Black Friday on Amazon (saved money!).I have to say this keeps me motivated and I even wear it to bed to see my sleep score and each stage I go through every night. This fitness tracker has so many options! From music; to alerting me when I have texts and calls coming in. Maybe these points do not excite many as they are probably all aware of them but from me coming from a zip I now feel part of the new updated world! Love this tracker!,5
1,I was worried this this wasn’t going to be strong enough to handle what I needed. I work with horses I was afraid it would get stretched up and ruined but it’s held up fantastic. I was worried it would be bulky and catch on things since I have tiny wrists but it works great and the small band fits perfectly. Still playing with all that it has to offer. But works great!,5
1,"I like it fine, but Alexa is completely useless; it is far too limited in what it can do. I have YouTube Premium so the Spotify, Pandora and Deezer apps are just taking up space. Also not a coffee drinker so the Starbucks app is just an unwanted ad. The sleep tracking, heart rate, and steps/miles are great tho. Just wish it had GPS instead of all this other crap.",3
1,"I really like understanding my sleep habits nd my real time heartrate. It also gives your resting heart rate and fitness level. Im still learning the accessibility of the apps too. The Bluetooth headphones and song and volume control from the watch was really great mowing the lawn. I wish you didn't have to have a subscription for apps you already use like pandora, or have to pay for ALL of the data on the fitness and sleep part, I feel like that all should be included with the watch purchase considering its price.",4
1,"I've had a Fitbit since 2016 and after debating between this and the newest Galaxy watch I think I made the best choice. It tracks everything without problem and I like that I don't have to go through the app to input everything anymore. I track all of my workouts (weights, cardio, tabata) from my wrist. I had to toy around with the notifications becauses notifications from Instagram and Twitter was draining the battery quicker. I can see my steps for that hour but my favorite is the period tracker.A down side I do have is that tracking water intake is not accurate. I'll put 16 oz into the watch and it will be correct for a few minutes but will change to like .8 oz. I just use the app for that.",5
1,"Have been looking for a smart watch for awhile...wanted something to track my sleep, activity, steps, weight, and could sync with my Galaxy Note 10+...this watch fits all of the items I wanted and then some...battery life is also better then I thought...battery lasts for at least 4 days before I get a battery low message...takes less then 2 hours to fully charge...would recommend this watch over any other one if your looking for the same things I was...the one thing it does that I was not expecting is that its able to know when I'm swimming without me even having to tell it.",5
0,"Hello. I wanted to post a review here to warn customers about the Versa 2. I bought mine in Oct-2020 and it lasted through May 2021, which unfortunately is a trend with Fitbit products. I was reluctant to invest in an Apple Watch, but feel that would have been better. After just 7 months, my Versa 2 battery started to die and would no longer keep charge. I contacted customer service, and it was an ordeal to get it replaced. I am still waiting for the replacement. I would not recommend the product.",2
1,This is the second Fitbit Versa 2 in 3 years and both have failing batteries. First one had a battery fail to take a charge after just over 1 year. Got a replacement at a discount. Now down to one day battery life and likely will have to be replaced. Thankfully the price has dropped. Not sure why the batteries seem to fail after a year or two. Have good charging habits. Still a very good watch and App and not willing to pay over twice as much for an Apple Watch with a relatively short battery life on a good day.,3
0,"PROS:(+) Sleek design.(+) Variety of looks with 3rd party bands.(+) Great for counting steps and as a smartwatch.CONS:(-) Does not accurately track distance while running.(-) GPS cuts out during runs.(-) During yoga, the screen will accidentally pause when my wrist touches my legs or ankles.(-) Metrics not advanced enough for training for a race (marathon).BACKGROUND:I was a loyal Fitbit Blaze user for about 2.5 years. When I first started, all I cared about was getting 10,000 steps and logging my food. As my fitness journey progressed, I started to incorporate TRX, yoga, and running.By this time, the Blaze had lived out its life and I was ready to upgrade. I chose the Versa 2 because of the design and because it is waterproof.Unfortunately, the Versa 2 was not able to keep up with my new fitness journey.(-) There is no TRX option on the exercise menu, so I had to choose ""workout.""(-) I suspected that Fitbit was not accurately tracking my distance during my runs. I started using STRAVA and confirmed my suspicion.(-) During my runs, the GPS would cut out and I would lose my route and stats.(-) During yoga, the exercise would ""pause"" when my wrist touched other parts of my body.I only owned the Versa2 for less than a month. I left the Fitbit community and crossed over to Garmin.",2
0,"Watch stopped working 15 months after purchase. Woke up and screen stopped responding.

If you buy this, get the warranty.",1
0,Pretty bummed that I have not even had this watch for 2 whole years and my screen is glitching and looks like tv snow. I really loved this watch up until this point. I have taken great care of it. I have never swam or dropped my watch. I charged the watch a couple weeks ago and when I put it on my wrist that screen was completely messed up. I contacted Fitbit support but they were not helpful whatsoever and the woman who took my support call seemed annoyed with my request for support and a remedy/solution to my problem.,2
1,"If you are buying this watch for the Alexa integration, look somewhere else. I bought this specific watch so I would have easy access to Alexa on my wrist. The microphone has stopped working which makes the Alexa function unusable. I could have saved a lot of money going with a watch that didn't have the Alexa option. Fitbit seems to not care about this issue. The Fitbit support forum has a thread about this known issue but apparently Fitbit doesn't care. Not happy with Fitbit. For the most part I'm happy with the rest of the functions of the watch.",3
1,"I have had fitbits for the last several years. After my last one broke, I went with a cheaper knockoff. After reading the reviews for the Versa 2, I decided to give it a go and I am glad I did. The battery lasts forever and I love the bigger screen. (Anyone over 40 knows what I mean by that!) I would recommend this product.",4
1,"I've owned 2 Fitbit trackers prior to getting the Versa 2. Those were the Flex and Flex 2. Obviously, the Versa 2 is a big upgrade over those trackers. I don't use all of the features, but the features I do use seem to work really well. I really like the detailed sleep analysis. It shows how much time you were awake and how much time you spent in each stage of sleep. It also provides an an overall sleep score in the morning. I also like ability to see my heart rate, which I didn't have on any of my previous trackers. It seems to be pretty accurate. When I'm on my exercise bike, the heart rate reported by it and my Versa 2 are usually within a couple of BPM from each other.I do a lot of cycling. So the thing I like the most is the stats I can get at the end of the ride. At the start of my ride, I simply select Bike as my exercise and wait for it to connect to GPS via my phone. At the end of my ride when I stop the exercise, I get a bunch of stats, such as distance, average and max speed, average and max heart rate, etc., and a map of the route along with graphs that show heart rate, elevation, and calorie burn. You can then move along the map route and it will highlight the values in the other charts that correspond to that point in your route. So you can see, for example, your heart rate at any point it the route. I imagine you get similar stats and graphs for other exercises such as running, although I'm not a runner so I don't know the exact stats that are computed for that exercise.The battery life is really good. I usually get 7 or 8 days on a single charge.I don't use Alexa, so I can't comment on it.Update: I had the watch for 2 years and everything was working fine. However, the heart rate sensor just stopped working. As a result, I get no heart rate related data and also get no sleep data. For a watch of this price, I would expect to get more than 2 years out of it. Now, it is an essentially an expensive fitness tracker that only tracks steps and floors. So I downgraded my initial rating from a 5 to a 3.",3
1,"Purchased Oct 2020 and enjoyed the app and watch. I like that it keeps up with my step count and sleep patterns. It's been interesting to see those scores. Now, April 2021 the watch disconnects all the time, so I don't get notifications for calls or texts. And maybe 3 months into owning it, the battery started lasting less and less. I read a review that said they charged it once a week. That was the case at first but now, I might get 3 days to a charge. Kinda disappointed after all the hype, wish I could return it",4
0,"Newer is not always better. My old fit bit was the slim pod, if I walked 3 steps or 3000 it was dead on. This one? Registers every movement like a step. One day I didn't leave the couch, and reached my 10k step goal 4 times! I was crocheting. It's great for keeping count of crochet stitches I guess, but I am a large woman who needs to step and walk, with this being inaccurate it's just the excuse I need to sit on my fat lazy butt. It's awesome to wake up in the morning and have 45 steps already logged on!Stuffing donuts down my fat face might register as steps too if I use the hand the versa is on. May as well try at this rate!Stick with the Alta. It was by far better.",1
0,"I bought this for my wife for Christmas. She primarily wanted one for the fitness tracking options. She paired it with her Android Moto G7 Play. After just a couple of weeks it started acting up. Problems such as the touchscreen not responding, notifications not coming through reliably, and the settings re-setting preferences daily. It is a huge disappointment because I didn't give her the gift until Christmas, so the return window had passed before she noticed it wasn't working properly. If we were able, we would return.",1

I've spent hours on help forums and multiple resets (4 hours of work last night alone!) to end up with a piece of fully charged black plastic on my wrist that continuously reads ""Reset failed. Please try again"". VERY DISAPPOINTED",1
1,LOVE my new Fitbit Versa 2 Easy to learn and very comfortable to wear. I have tiny arms so I was worried about the face size but its turned out fine even when dressing up. I am at the age that new technology isn't always my friend. I had my Samsung watch for a really long time so I was worried about the switch. My fears were unfounded and intact it's been so easy my husband got himself one also. I am looking forward to the merger with Google so I can retire Alexa. Recieved my order two days early. Packaged with no damage. I love my purple band :),5

It tracks my walks, my sleep, I can log my weight loss, and it’ll notify me when someone calls or texts me. Easy to use and log your health journey. Now, my only complaint are watch faces. Getting and using watch faces can be complicated for someone not used to technology, but I’m 22 so I understand how to buy items using 3rd party websites and then transfer the faces back to the watch.",5
1,"It does what it says, but is rather difficult to learn. Example, to sync you have to find the button which hides itself unless you pull it down. My cellphone also is often unable to find the watch without resetting the watch and/or the cellphone. .On the plus side it does track calories and food intake making weight loss easier. The sleep tracking also is helpful. My general sense is that I should have gotten the Versa Lite or Charge 2 because many of the features I'm unlikely to use and add complexity. However, the price ($150) put it in the same range as those watches and the display is also much improved over the Charge 2 I previously had. Hopefully the durability is also improved. I've had 2 and neither lasted more than 2 years.",4
0,"I've had this for 3 months, always hard to connect. Finally Bluetooth stopped working, absolutely useless. I've now had this for 9 months, I should have thrown 200 dollars down the toilet. This has been the worst purchase in my life (I'm 75 years old). Besides every couple of days not syncing, now I just get a total lit up screen - no time or anything else. By the way when the bluetooth stops working the clock feature starts losing time, so not even a good watch. Save your money do not buy!!!!!",1
0,"Fitbit Versa 2 is pretty. Had for 4 days learning how to get the most out of it. Will not stay synced with Alexa even with app open in background, so can’t receive messages regularly. Tapping does not work well to awaken the watch. I’m returning the device.New note 01/27/2021: contacted Fitbit, they claim the connection issues are ongoing and do not know when they will fixed. I’ve really tried to figure out a way to keep the device. After reading all the other complaints about syncing issues, I do not believe this watch will hold up.",2
0,Does not track BPM and calories burned on Elliptical. After my third troubleshooting call with Fitbit they finally told me that it’s a known issue and they’re working on it. When I use the elliptical it only registers between 86-96 BPM when in reality I am above 160. Not good enough and not safe for me.It does work fine when I switch over to weights though.I never had this problem with the Blaze.They wouldn’t refund or replace. I wish I never bought this thing.Good luck.,1
0,"My daughter got it for Christmas, and it died before she had it for a year. Nothing we do can get it started. For this amount of money, I am not happy with that at all. I read reviews afterward and found that a lot of people have had the same problems with it. Online there are MANY people complaining about the same problem we had. Online ""fixes"" for the problem didn't work with ours. She loved using the watch to track how far she jogged, and she enjoyed seeing her steps each day, etc. Now she wants another one, but I'm not willing to spend that much money on junk that doesn't last. It's sad.",2
0,It’s really just an overgrown FitBit with marginal watch features. The Text messages displayed on the watch is finicky because it requires notifications to be on and previewed when my iPhone is locked (something I’ve never enabled in 7+ years as I prefer keeping texts private ). Need to keep the FitBit iPhone app running all the time. Have had to reset watch once in first month because it lost connect with my 4 month old XR. Can’t scroll long messages.Apps are clunky to use and navigate to. Touch screen sometimes needs 3-5 taps to illuminate.If all you want is a fancy interface to read steps and distance then it’s ok. But it’s not good enough at the watch functionality for me to keep. Have returned it after using for a couple weeks.,2
1,"Absolutely love it! It feels very high quality and fancy, which it should given the price, but it is definitely more affordable than some other watches! I can read all messages, turn on do not disturb before bed, and of course track my steps, sleep, and everything else.It has all the features I wanted, plus alexa on my wrist! I'll be honest, it has been more useful than expected! I was able to view my shopping list at the store, and turn on/off lights without disturbing people in the house by yelling for my alexa.It's a great watch, and not half as bulky as I was worried about.",5
1,"Love this watch. It has been everything I have wanted. It is very pretty. Constant heart rate monitor, reminders to move every hour, sleep tracking, which is getting more accurate the longer I have it. I can receive text and WhatsApp messages, and return an answer. But I cant find the phone with it. Extremely disappointed. ""find your phone"". I thought I could do without it, but sadly it is a feature that I need because I dont walk around the house all day with my phone in my hand. My last very cheap activity tracker had this feature and it was very helpful..so this will be going back. Too bad because I had already picked out a nice dressy bracelet band to make it prettier.",4
1,I like all the options of this device. However my only con so far is the irrigation to my wrist from time to time. I’ve noticed the “rash” type marks after long walks or yard work were sweating is involved. I take it off during showers and to charge about every 3-4 days. The app continues to ask for my location even after I’ve set my location just a couple of days prior. Knowing what I know now I would have researched a little more. Biggest issue for me it the band rash.,3
0,"Very disappointed in this product. I’ve bought several Fitbit products and really thought I was going to upgrade with the Versa 2. I have bought the first generation Fitbit, upgraded to the Inspire and thought I was getting a super upgrade with buying the Versa 2. I bought it in March 2021 and everything was working properly. In July 2021 is stopped tracking my heart rate and my sleep. I reset several times and could not make it come back and work. November 2021 it isn’t tracking anything. Button doesn’t work. It’s dead. I’m not harsh on the watch. I wear it with the demographics that were in the description which made me buy it. I wouldn’t recommend buying because it doesn’t last more that 9 months . I bought one for my moM for a gift and she is having the same issues after just a few months At least Christmas is coming up. I might have to buy an apply watch since I assume that would last long than this junk. Honestly I’m just upset that it died. I advocate for the FitBit. I still go to check my watch even though it’s not there. Disappointing",1
1,"The ONLY reason I give this a 4 star overall is because it is NOT compatible with Amazon Music. I pay for the unlimited family plan. It works with Pandora, Deezer and Spotify so if you have any of those premium servers you are good. You can also sync music from your computer much like the old MP3 players. But seeing as it comes with Alexa built in, I find it kind of silly that it doesn't support Amazon's own music streaming service. If they ever update this compatibility I will absolutely revise my review to 5 stars.",4
0,"I bought this a year ago to replace my Versa. The biggest negative for me is that the versa 2 doesn't display your lap count when you are swimming. You can see the lap count in your app afterwards, but that doesn't really help when I am trying to remember how many more I have left to do in each set. It also doesn't have reliable notification/connectivity to texts/emails etc. All in all a very disappointing product. I won't be buying a Fitbit until they start displaying lap counts again.",1
1,"Edit: there is nothing wrong with the watch, I still love it! However, the band is horrible! It gave me a sore that took several days to heal without wearing the watch and putting some ointment on it. After it was healed I put my watch back on and within a few days it was back. It did the same thing to my daughter. My suggestion would be to buy a different band.Love my new versa! I love the new features like the text notification and voice to text back. I can't talk on the phone through it though. I Googled it and it treks me how to do it, but I don't have those things, like the blue tooth, in my settings on the fitbit app so I don't know what to do",3
1,"Had this version for 18 months and liked the features but the accuracy of the heart rate when running was totally off every single time (compared to my polar chest and arm sensor).After 13 months the whole glass with electronics came off, glued it back into the frame with a little super glue at the edges only, nothing inside and it worked. Last week the watch died completely, first it showed a battery sign with an exclamation mark, did not charge anymore and is now completely dead. Did expect fhe watch to last longer than 17 months.",3
1,Love the display size. I can see it without trouble. It tracks everything I need. The battery life is about three days for me. I get an email when my battery is running low. Great little tracker for someone that doesn’t need all of functions of the i-watch,5
0,"Bought this is a gift for my adult daughter who is in her 20's and is tech savvy. It completely quit working and will not charge in less than 90 days after getting it. And Amazon customer service will do nothing but provide me the website for Fit Bit. Amazon will do nothing after 30 days so don't buy this is a holiday gift and don't buy it from Amazon. Go to Fit Bit and buy there or better yet, buy a competitor's product. This was a huge waste of money.",1
1,The sleep tracker is worthless. This has been the case on every Fitbit I’ve owned. Battery life probably it’s least concern. Step/stair tracking so so but inaccurate. It gives credit for steps I don’t take. Misreads activity as steps.The best thing about Fitbit is actually their customer/technical support.I’ve finally had it! Bought an Apple Watch this past week and it’s worth every penny! Trust me…,3
1,"Update: I reached out to customer service about my concern with the battery life. They asked me to perform a few reasonable tasks with the device and app. After that, they sent out a new base device at no charge. For this, increased my rating from 2-3 stars. If the battery life remains after a couple of months of use, I will update again and improve the rating again.Previously I owned a Samsung gear fit (yes, I am an android user). Based on the description of Alexa integration, sleep tracking and 5 day battery life, I decided to give this a try. Wish I had invested in another Samsung! Immediately after arrival I could not get the device to update. Called support and was told that they were updating and it was not available to update this so my brand new product was immediately useless. This issue resolved itself hours later. The step tracking does seem accurate. The Alexa integration does work but is VERY limited. After using it for a couple of months now the battery is awful. Lasts about a day. Very unhappy and will not be purchasing another Fitbit product.",3
1,"It was an elegant watch with a bright vivid display, the Alexa control worked well and was very impressive.The main reason I got it was my Inspire HR had a Swim tracking setting, but It didn't display anything on the watch - you had to sync it with the phone and look at the App to see what you did.Pretty inconvenient if you are at the side of the pool and are wondering if you met your goal or if you should to a couple more laps.So on a You Tube video it showed the FitBit Versa counting laps and distance and displaying it on the watch during the swim. I thought the Versa 2 would do the same thing. But NO it didn't, while I swam it only showed the time in the pool. At the end of my swim session it stated to see the FitBit App for my swim statistics.So I sent it back, now I'm the proud owner of a Garmin Swim 2.",4
0,"IT'S A PIECE OF CRAP!!! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THE VERSA 2. I WISH I HADN'T CAUSE IT ONLY TRACKS HALF OF EVERYTHING. SLEEP, STEPS, STAIRS, CALORIES BURNED, ETC. I WISH I HAD RETURNED IT WHEN I 1ST NOTICED IT CAUSE NOW I'VE SPENT A LOT OF MONEY ON SOMETHING DOESN'T WORK & AMAZON WON'T LET ME RETURN IT NOW. I 1ST THOUGHT IT WAS A FITBIT ERROR. NOW I KNOW IT'S THE ACTUAL VERSA 2. EXTREMELY MAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
1,"Love all the features on the watch and the App. Especially the Sleep Tracker. The only issue is like others, I developed a ""burn"" on the sides of my wrist. During exercise you sweat and your skin stays moist under the band. After awhile your skin gets tender and the band rubs it raw. I need to order a nylon band but until then I will not where to bed to let my skin air out and apply some shea butter",4
1,"I had the Kate Spade Scallop 2 and hated it, the battery died every 4-5 hours and the processor was sluggish and would crash frequently. I cannot say enough good things about the Versa 2! Hands down my favorite feature of this watch is Alexa! There are so many times throughout the day I'll have a random though and by simply squeezing the outside button of the watch Alexa is there to set reminders for everything! Translates to text perfectly and I have not missed a beat on a lot of small tasks I would normally fall behind on. I love the move reminders and have become more active at my desk job in order to feel like I'm meeting their challenge. The fitness aspect of the watch is great but the little extras like Alexa, sleep tracking, and reminders make it such a great value at an affordable price!",5
1,"I love this product and all the features. My only gripe is that it's not very durable. I bought one for my mother after the one she bought stopped working after a year. I'm reordering myself another one b/c mine stopped working less than a year after I got it. I WILL be ordering the protection plan this time around. I strongly recommend getting the plan if you are going to buy this. Once is an accident, twice means I don't trust it to last",4
1,"Overall the watch functioned well in measuring activities. However, the bluetooth connection distance was very limited, often failing to stay connected one room away. After investigating why there was no bluetooth connection icon displayed on my phone, I discovered that Fitbit apparent uses a low energy bluetooth with a documented range of UP TO 30 feet. The actual range I achieved was about half of that. My basis of comparison for bluetooth connection distance was my Samsung Active Watch 2. which stays connected even as I range about the yard. I am returning the Fitbit Versa 2.",3
1,"I find the movbile app a little hard to deal with, but the Fitbit Versa 2 syncs steps and sleep to the Weight Watchers app which has been much easier than keeping track of when you actually slept and pairing it with an adjustable print elastic watch band and with multiple cases available through Amazon allows me to wear it around my ankle which more accurately tracks my steps. I can also set it to remind me of medication times and time I need to head off to bed.",5
1,"I love my fitbit, I finally found what I was looking for in a watch. I love that I can receive my messages and can reply back with press programmed different sayings. Tracks my heart rate, my steps and so much more. The battery life last longer than 5 days, I'll usually put to charge on a Saturday and even at that it still has battery power. Highly recommend this watch.",5
1,I’m not a fan of the versa 2 after having it for two months. I feel like the charge is more accurate with calculating our steps and floors. Steps are getting counted when I’m not moving and just sitting in the car as a passenger as well as when I’m driving. However my floors climb never count when the same exact floors were counted with my old charge 2. I’m highly disappointed with the versa and I thought I was making an upgrade from my charge 2. I also do not feel like it’s truly water proof because while visiting Destin my watch barely got wet in the pool with the small kids outside of being splashed by little ones. This little trip to the pool with my little cousins age 1 and 3 caused my versa to Not work at all for a whole week and a half even with a full charged battery. I know for a fact I didn’t go under water because I was busy holding the little ones up above the water.,3
1,Got the fitbit yesterday. Very happy. App recognized me from my previous device. I guess trying to replace the last fitbit was a mistake. I tried two other devices. One took over my phone and had defects and overheated. The other was not accurate and the back light didnt work. Took it out of the box got it set up and evedything is good so far. It does exactly what I expected it to do. If theres any change Ill add that to my review. Today I noticed the coating on the back of the device is worn off. I also noticed that I have a spot where the sensors go.,5
1,"This is the third one I have purchased, onefor each member of the family. I purchased the first one for myself about a year ago after upgrading from the Charge and loved it. Long battery life that lasts for about 5 days and large easy to read screen that can be customized to your preferences. There is a lot of technology available such as find my iPhone, Spotify, wallet and many others that are very convenient. I have had zero issues with it and it has changed my life and made me much more active.",5
1,"After a year, the screen fell off. It has 1 year warranty, so.. there's that.Often it won't track my workouts, unsure if it's because they are out of my set active hours (you need to set your active hours, for some reason, instead of it tracking them by itself. Very inconvenient if your routine varies widely)I wish it had just an USB input instead of that weird charger it comes with. Sometimes it says ""not charging"". No apparent reason for that.After a year of using it, the screen sometimes won't respond to touch.The app also needs a lot of improvements.I've glued the screen, but when it stops working or finally breaks, I won't get another fitbit, that's for sure, it's a terrible investment.",3
0,"I bought the Versa 2 after owning the Versa with hopes that it was an improvement, but it still seems to have the same problems I had with the Versa. I owned the Versa, bought it because it claimed to be waterproof, but had to replace it 3 times within the first year. Two of the times, I had worn the Versa in a swimming pool and it quit working that same day. The other time, it quit communicating with my phone. It's pretty crazy to go through 3 devices in one year, especially since I have a desk job and don't really put my device through a lot of abuse. At the time, the customer support was very good - each time I reached out to them, they verified the Versa wasn't working and immediately shipped me a replacement.So, I bought the Versa 2 (and an extended warranty since I know their products fail frequently). When the Versa 2 failed after I wore it in a swimming pool (again, I bought it because it claims that you CAN wear it in water), it took weeks and several phone calls to get a replacement. First, I contacted them with the issue, then they said I would get a replacement when they received my device back, but to call support and give them the tracking number when I shipped the item. So, I shipped the device back and when I called the following day to give them the tracking number, after being on hold for 5 minutes, the representative said to call back when the item delivered. So, 3 days later, I called again... to tell them it was delivered. I was then told that they will process the receipt of the item in a couple of days and then send me an email with instructions on how to get the replacement. I am now over 1 week and several calls into this process and still don't know if/when I will get the replacement. Their customer service used to be excellent, but now it is slow and unhelpul. I don't know when they made these changes. I just know my next fitness tracking device will not be a FitBit.",2
0,"I find it a waste of money. Here are the issues i found:1. I doesn't connect with wifi at all . major problem2. Initial update was very slow3. Sometime it losses heart rate monitoring automatically.4. Requires Spotify/Pendora premium to play music.5. I choose 3 month free Fitbit premium but still not showing any premium feature.6. Not many official apps to use, btw there are Some useless official apps . Almost useless watch in this sense.7. Does't detect current location automatically",1
1,"I'm a very simple person. I really don't use apps on this or go test water resistence . All I wanted out of this watch was tracking and to see notifications in case of an emergency because I can't have my phone on me while I'm working . Notifications are fine the tracking is off I've tried/tested it various ways even with my phone on me which really defeats the purpose of it for me as that's half the reason I got it to not have my phone on me. It didn't even work then. At the best it's inconsistent. Some places it works others it didn't , some days it counted clapping others it didnt, some days it counted steps while in the car and others it didnt. I really expected better.",3
0,"Got these burns from the wristband. I have use fitbit for years and this is the first time I have experienced this chemical burn. I found articles saying it could be an allergy or that it happens when you wear it too tight or when there's moisture.... but that doesn't make sense. I've used fitbit for years and never experienced this and worn it in the pool, in the heat, etc.Found another article stating that it could be a chemical burn with the battery reacting to the salts on your skin. It feels like a chemical burn. My skin is red, raised and painful to the touch. The darker spot is starting to scab. Please beware!!!",1
1,Was very excited when I got this as a bday gift. No issues setting up was pretty easy.After wearing for a week it started to disconnect from my phone. Wondered why I wasn't getting any notification only to look at the watch to see it wasn't connected.This is happening a lot and is very frustrating.Have a cheaper watch I bought from Amazon and seems to NEVER disconnected but doesn't have the features like this that are needed and the screen is very small making it hard to see.,3
0,"Does not track anything accurately. Counts steps when im sitting in the couch and sleeping, and I don’t mean like one or two steps it counts like 30 without me even moving. I went for a six mile walk and my watch said I only walked 2... I’ve restarted and updated it as they advised me to do and it’s still not accurate at all. You’d think for $200 it would be better but it’s way offUpdate: I chatted with fitbit on Twitter about all my problems I was having with the watch multiple times and nothing helped at all so I ended up returning it and getting and Apple Watch which I love",2
0,"So this is weird but has anyone with this watch experienced numbing on that hand and has the watch left a bright red circle on your wrist? Because that happened to me! It’s almost as if the radiation from the watch was affecting my skin ! I’ve stopped wearing it, need to contact Fitbit support system and see what they say but just a FYI on my experience.",1
0,"I don't have sensitive skin. I'm not allergic to anything, but the versa 2 has left me with red, flaking skin in outlines of the band on my wrist. This is after I have completed the care instructions: taking it off for an hour a day, wash with specialized cleanser, etc. Just don't do it. Fitbit ""help"" timed me out twice while I was attempting to get the information required. If you are a masochist, this may be a product for you.",1
0,"Trying to register for the App and it needs a confirmation email. The confirmation email arrived 6 hours later and it says ""link expired and resend email"" I've resent the email 20 times and nothing! I went to the Support page and there is no Support - no email option , no chat, no phone number! There is a forum but guess what? you have sign up to ask a question! This POS goes back todayUpdate: I was wrong - they do have Tech support - they told me you needed a Corporate email address and not just any ISP. I did get it to work with a gmail account which I never use, though.",2
1,"I love the watch and having Alexa built in has been even greater than I imagined. The display is brilliant. I wish the oxygen sensor worked all day instead of only while sleeping. Just ordered a new charger and covers today. Coming from a Charge 2 it is really nice to be able to see the time in the daylight. Never happy to have the typical fitbit sync issues or extra charges for stuff. I signed up for the free 3 months of premium service but will cancel it before the date comes up. From what I have heard, Garmin does not have all the extra charges.",5
1,"Firt thing I can honestly say that I like about my Fitbit Versa 2 is that it very similar to the apple watch in terms of replying to texts, getting alerts from other apps on your phone and the ability to reply to other messages as well. I like the customizable bands you can purchase for it and I like that you can customize the screen on your watch. I think it needs a bit more tweaking in terms of sometimes if the phone isn't in a certain range of the watch it won't allow you to reply to messages. The Fitbit app tracks your sleep, bpm, steps, as well as other exercises. It also tracks monthly data (for females). You can adjust your watch to your lifestyle in the app. I have a LG Stylo 4, so if anyone has this phone, it is compatible with this version of the Fitbit.",5
1,"The sleep tracking is nice for a chronic insomniac. Once you adjust the tracking of steps, it's quite accurate. I like the number of activities you can track and I love some of the fitness apps you can download. The waterproof is fabulous and the battery life is great. I work with horses so I'm hard on things and this has held up beautifully The downside? It may as well not have alexa because it rarely works. It will occasionally crash and not be able to sync which is an easy fix but annoying if it happens during a run. Overall, I haven't found anything better.",4
1,"Did not need GPS because health tracking features (sleep, heart rate etc.) are priority over fitness tracking for me. One less device tracking me was most appealing reason to get the VERSA 2 over the VERSA 3. There are several Chinese knockoffs out there that are appealing but then you have to rely on Chinese Apps and who knows what data they are collecting... Got the device and set it up to find out Alexa wants to listen! Ugh! Just do not activate Alexa and that problem is solved!",5
1,"I loved the Fitbit Charge HR but wanted a bigger, clearer display. This fits the bill. I guess the one drawback, and it isn't a Fitbit only problem, is that some of the apps require a premium(paid) membership in order to use them on your Fitbit.UPDATE: I bought the Versa 2 in December 2019. By April 2020 the screen had become unresponsive. It continued to record and display my stats correctly, but it did not respond to any swipes or taps. I contacted FitBit support via a chat window and they replaced it for FREE! Yay Fitbit! I consider this superb customer service. Plus, I did not have to chat with somebody on the phone and be put on hold etc.,",5
1,"I use this watch to monitor my sleep since I am experiencing insomnia. This watch helps a lot by measuring sleep in stages,... It is compatible with my Apple iPhone. I use this watch to also measure steps and some for tracking exercise. The watch is a little expensive, and changing the band from a small to large was really annoying, but it is a good quality watch. I also like that it is LED and not LCD for the display. Another good feature is that I am getting at least 5 days per battery charge (I charge it by the time it gets to 25% so I do not know exactly how many days it will last. I am quite pleased with this smartwatch.",5
0,"The only thing that works really good is the steps counter. When I try to track my bike ride, it only gives me the time spent. When I try to track my laps swum, it gives me a ridiculously high number. It does track the time I'm in the pool though. When I lift my hand up to check time or another feature, 8 times out of 10 I am forced to hit the On button when it is supposed to light up automatically. All in All, I'm not happy with this FitBit. It's a waste of money.",2
1,I love the fit bit versa 2. It helps track time exercises and other things. My old one did not have that clock on it. It also tracks heart rate which is good for me only thing that I find the app has better gps tracking than versa itself because it does not have it but you can use to compare exercises from versa against your phone when. You carry it with you. I suggest getting a ten protector if your anything like me I am a klutz when it comes to swinging my wrists in everything and it keeps it nice and clean. Otherwise only bad thing is the protector has to come off to charge. Otherwise battery for me has lasted 3-4 days because I use notification vibration on wrist.,4
1,"I wanted a fitness watch in order to keep better track of my steps. I purchased the Fitbit Versa 2 with pink band. I love it! It's really easy to get going and looks very nice. You can use as much as you want or as little as you want for your heath and fitness tracking. There are plenty of free ""face"" choices if you don't like the layout of the watch face that is standard. There are plenty of options to allow you to customize what you like to track. I am very happy with this purchase.",5
1,"Just upgraded from the original Fitbit Versa and there are still huge bug problems. You can't even set up the watch if you do not the latest version of the app, which glitches and will not download OS onto the watch. The sleep score feature malfunctioned the first day, and Alexa will only work if you are connected to the internet & are syncing Bluetooth all day with your phone nearby. If you out without your phone, Alexa will not work.The watch overall is very pretty and sleek, but very similar to the original Versa and the Versa lite.",3
1,"While I had it, it was not a bad product. The sleep tracking and activity tracking were pretty accurate. I had a problem syncing it at first, but I fixed it with the troubleshooting on the website. The only problem I had with it was the size. I imagine most people don't have a problem with it, but I found it to be too big. I went from a Charge 2 to this, so I think that may have been the problem. Overall, a good product, but if you don't like larger watches, this is not for you.",4
1,"My FitBit Versa 2 has exceeded all my expectations! I love the larger face, the choice of watch faces, and the colorful “party on my wrist” , when I hit my goal of steps👏👏. Alexa at my fingertips, heart rate, messages, and so much more! My Fitbit Versa 2 is my third Fitbit, and now my favorite❤️",5
1,"I love this watch. I can chose from so many different faces, some free and some you have to pay for. The app is super easy to use, just as the watch is. It just takes a few minutes (days) to get used to the watch and which way to swipe for what. It does so much too. I only wish I could answer my texts and phone with it. I can decline and answer calls with it, but when I answer, I still have to use my phone. It has the sleep score, heart rate, stress level, it reminds you to move and so much more. You can log your food on the app as well. There are so many types of exercises to choose from that it will track for you. From running, to weight lifting. Absolutely awesome, especially for the price.",5
1,Its a beautiful watch. Love the style. Battery lasts a long time. Doesnt answer text messages or phone calls. Which I was under the impression you can check your phone while using it. And it doesnt really use Alexa except it can answer a question if you had one. Like whats 2 plus 2. Haha. It cant play music or control your phone hands free. Will change a song sometimes. Doesnt. Always work. Also my steps build even when im driving which i dont like i drive alot and if you even swing your arm it will track it as steps. I hope they update it to do more. I love Alexa items. And my whole house is alexa and my watch doesnt connect to any of it.,4
1,"So I really like the fit of this watch. After a year of wearing it I did notice some things. It's quite comfortable and connects to your phone and the app relatively easy. The watch give accurate readings as far as heart rate, sleep tracking, and steps, ect. The relay of notifications to the watch is instant and easy to reply to text from watch. The reason I gave this three stars is due to the battery life. Even with most advanced settings turned of and brightness on dim the battery life only last about 1 or 2 days at max. Wich is unfortunate for a person with a busy life casue once I take it off to charge I tend to forget I have it till I find it again. If your looking for something with more battery I would not recommend this one. But other than that it's a great watch.",3
0,"I got a Versa 2 and after about 9 months the heart rate wasn't working. Fitbit replaced it. Now about 8 months after I got the replacement, the heart rate monitor stopped working again. Since it's a replacement there's no warrenty. They gave me a discount code for 35% off a new watch but why would I buy from them again?I'm switching to the Garmin VenuSq and hopefully that one actually works for more then a year.",1
1,"I know a lot of large review sites have pointed out some issues, mainly being with the connectivity, but so far my girlfriend hasn't run into any major issues, or issues so large she needed to troubleshoot.Alexa is a nice add on from the previous gen 1 Versa, and the OLED screen is welcome.It's a fitbit. It does what a fitness tracker is supposed to do. It does mostly what a smartwatch can do (with some limitations (such as calling/texting).The price is OK. If you want a nice looking wearable this is a good choice.",4
0,"The latest firmware update from Fitbit is killing Versa 2s. There are many furious fitbit owners over this. And Fitbit is doing nothing other than offer a 35% discount on a new watch. Do not buy from Fitbit they do not stand by their product. Go to their website Fitibit.com and search for ""Versa 2 stopped working after firmware update"" and see for yourself",1
1,"This is my second Versa, the first one has a very scratched up face. With the first, my wife gave me an aftermarket band with it, so I never had to ""swap"" in a factory band that would fit. With this one I thought I'd give it a try, but after a good twenty minutes, I'm giving up and will just buy another aftermarket band. Fitbit should either make their bands a bit smaller at the attachment point or make it possible to order a large instead of a small.Was also bummed that the Cyber Monday price was lower than the Black Friday price I bought on.",3
1,"After having the watch for a few months the device is great! Its very durable and I'm loving the stats and progress alerts i get when I'm taking a stroll. When I can't have my phone out the notifications pop up on my watch, Even better I get to choose what notifications I want to see pop up on the watch. Its a blast though I'm having a bit of trouble connecting my Bluetooth to the thing..everything still works fine..but its bothersome that it doesn't connect.. i don't know if that will be an issue for others but i 11/10 Would 1000% recommend this watch for yourself or family or partners to keep everyone connected! Especially with the alexa perk added which makes it 2x worth it IMO. Its sleep tracking is pretty dope when you review it on the fitbit mobile app. It tells you how deep you slept, how light you slept, how many hours you did of each, when did you wake up, if you hit your sleep goal, and it gives you a sleep rating. The accuracy on mine has been wonky as of late with the movement..I don't know if its supposed to track me taking steps when I move my arm without actually taking a step cause I'm one of those ""move my hands when I'm talking or making a point"" kinda guy..doesn't bother me one bit really but I'm just saying 😁.. again the fitbit watch is amazing but you should check out their more up to date stuff. They have some other pretty good fitbits with the same price or cheaper depending on what you use the watch for.",4
1,"Well, I realize I don't get nearly as many steps in as I thought. And of course with nothing else to do because of covid I should be walking more but haven't been. It works great. But now I feel like a failure. LOL So I suggest getting this when you are really motivated. I do like the notifications every hour that tell me to get up and move (you can set this; it isn't automatic). So at least I force myself to do a lap around the office.But seriously it works great and I bought one for my daughter in law for Christmas.",5
1,"Comparing my Versa 2 with my brother's garmin, we both agreed that the fitbit has superior graphics and interface. However, unlike the garmins, there's no built-in gps. As well, I've read that the versa battery life isn't as great as the garmin.However, I find that the battery still lasts about a week (given I don’t have it update me with notifications from my phone cause I find that annoying, and I don’t have the “always-on” watch face, so I have to tap the watch to illuminate it)!Overall, my brother and I agreed that versa wins for everyday functionality, and the garmin wins for athletes who don't want to take their phones running in order to get gps tracking.",5
0,"I really liked this Fitbit for the first 9 months or so after purchasing. At some point after then, I no longer received alerts when my phone got texts. I tried to several manipulations on the phone and Fitbit to get it to work again, but it never did. More recently the screen/face of the Fitbit stopped working, essentially rendering it useless. Although I wore it almost constantly, I always removed it when showering or swimming. So I believe that it just wasn’t durable.",2
1,"I love everything Fitbit. Since 2013! This 2019 versa 2 is my favorite so far. Not ready for an applewatch yet.For those of you having issues such as mine, regardless where you bought it from, reset to factory settings and then turn off your device. Turn it back on. It should fix itGo to your Fitbit app and check out their amazing support. They realized my versa was defective and immediately ordered me a replacement.My watch works fine except for the sudden display of a bright white line on the left side of screen ~picture attached~",4
0,Does not track location. Does not sync to Bluetooth unless you delete it from the app each time. Does not track sleep. I made the mistake if not returning it in time. Tried calling Fitbit customer service and was told that this is a known issue. They asked me try resetting it and uninstalling and reinstalling the device from the app. Still does not work as advertised. No solution. Super annoyed that I paid $200 for a device that does not work as advertised. Don't buy the Versa2. I had the Charge2 before and it worked wonderfully but this one is a Dud!,1
0,"I had and loved a Fitbit Blaze for over 2 years. I finally upgraded to the Versa 2 and really liked the new features. The watch looks good, has great battery life, is easy to use and the Fitbit App is great. That said, I returned the watch.In the 2 weeks I had it I had 3 seperate times where, a couple minutes into a workout the workout program would stop and the watch face would display. I looked online and see others have had the same issue over the course of time. I contacted Fitbit and to their credit they responded and gave me a couple things to try. Unfortunately none of them worked and the watch continued to stop workouts occasionally. This watch really is a fitness tracker first and if that is not 100% reliable, I cannot justify keeping it. Fitbit customer support in the end said they are aware of the problem, other users have reported it but they do not have a fix for it at this time. They said a Firmware update may come out in the future.Great looking watch but Fitbit seems to have a problem with some units and they know it. I hope they can find a fix for it. If your unit does not have this problem you will probably really like it.",2
0,"I have been a fit bit customer since 2017 I use to have the charges and just bought with fit bit, however my last fit bit product charger 4 broke before one year of use and I was ready for a better product. First time being out of fit bit buying. good price fast delivery, and has been work great I hope it holds longer than the chargers.UpdateHowever, I would say to people to stay clear fromFitbit products because after receiving the product in January 30 2022 it does no longer holds charge as March 2022.With money spent in 6 fit bit trackers I could have got a better deal with the competition.",1
1,"The first week, I was in love. I was worried it was just a honeymoon phase, but two months in and my Fitbit versa 2 and I are going strong!!!I run, weight lift, swim, hike, do yoga, walk the dog...it tracks it all. For those concerned, its been excellent in the pool. And shower. And rain and sweat and snow. Haven’t risked it in the ocean or a mud run.It’s been a great added boost to my motivation and helps me keep focus on my health.There are some fun and useful apps, basic but handy and enjoyable. Love all the watch face options, can choose simple to flashy, themed, clock face, analog, all the stats, some stats, no stats. Smart alarm has been a much nicer way to wake, I don’t even use a noise alarm anymore. Music control is really handy and necessary for me, shows the song/artist, let’s me pause, skip, adjust volume. Fits nicely, I often check if it’s still on cause I don’t even feel it half the time. Charges fast. Lasts me ~5 days.Okay, so, I love it. But, it’s not perfect. Mostly the app, which has issues retaining data sometimes, certain logs like distance or days exercised disappear and reappear, and I wish it had a dark mode. Watch has difficult connecting and maintaining Bluetooth connection during runs (but still tracks distance via steps taken). The food tracker is frustrating and I wish it would sync with MyPlate.Accuracy... I think it’s ok? I’ll count my steps and the watch matches, often even with hands in pocket. I run on a treadmill and the heart rates are generally spot on, a little lag but they end up matching. It always catches when I fall asleep very well. Says it doesn’t log naps, but it has for me, just summarizes the sleep time though rather than tracking any cycles. Sometimes I’ll wake up mid-dream and when I check cycles later it shows it, and when I know I slept great or terrible I’ll see it reflected in the stats, so it’s been gaining my trust.K that’s all I can think of right now. Long review but when you’re looking for a fitness tracker, you’ve got questions, expectations, and certain must-haves, right??I did a lot of research and debating before giving in, but I am definitely happy I bought this watch.Happy shopping 🤗",5
0,"I’ve had the watch one month and has been problematic on and off to start to now more consistently. The pedometer is off, not slightly but way off. I noticed and since have used another to compare as well as colleagues who I literally work side by side with and it can fluctuate from 2-4K off. The watch almost never syncs to the app which is the entire purpose of having it to review data etc. all around a headache looking at my options to return at this point it’s just a severely overpriced digital watch",2
1,"So i do like that it tells me that i am getting a call. - although I should be able to answer the call from my catch.I wish the texting feature was much better, right now it sucks.Worst of all is how this watch charges. I hate hate hate hate hate it. I would not buy it again on that alone. It is a special charger that will not charge with any screen protector on. This means that everrrrrrry time I want to charge the watch I need to take off the case. It is sooo annoying and is destroys the screen protectors.",3
0,"I purchased the FitBit Versa 2 in March 2020 so I have been wearing it everyday for 9 months. Pretty early on I noticed what some other reviews had mentioned: it doesn't read heart rate well when you sweat. For a while, I would just keep a towel with me during my workout and occasionally take the watch off on rests and wipe off the watch and my wrist. This was annoying since I rather not have to worry about my watch while I am working out, but it usually helped. Sadly, this is no longer working. There will be huge gaps of my workout where I am huffing and puffing and the watch reads in ""below zones."" This is infuriating when you know you're working hard and would like to be able to track it, but instead my heart rate is reading in the 80's. One of the main reasons I got this watch was to track heart rate during my workouts and it is not able to do that properly.Also, the piece that holds the excess strap down is also starting to tear and will likely break off soon. Without this, I can't imagine wearing the watch at all with the excess strap flapping around and getting caught on things all day.When this watch is functioning properly, it is great for motivating throughout the day and keeping track of my steps. I really like seeing how I slept and how my workouts went, but I will likely have to replace this with a different brand in order to properly track heart rate. Really bummed that it didn't even make it functioning for a full year. The battery life is pretty good though, I do appreciate that I don't have to charge it all the time.",2
1,"I've had a fitbit light that I needed to have replaced twice. The second time, fitbit just refunded my money. I thought I would give the fitbit 2 a try. So far it seems to be working fine. I have yet to get more than 2-3 days before I need to recharge it. The information on it said it would hold a charge for approx. 8 days. That's a bit disappointing but I can live with it. A guess time will tell if this one holds up better than the fitbit light.",4
0,"The app for this is absolutely horrible! You can’t edit it. I had a Fitbit a couple years ago and they won’t let me use my email address. There’s no help or alternative. I even got another email and try to set it up and then they communicated with me on my first email that they wouldn’t accept. It is archaic and you can tell that somebody put out the app and then just forgot about it. They don’t keep up with it! I think they want you to buy their premium software. Judging from how bad the regular software works, that is not going to happen. I really want to make it work but I’m returning it.",2
0,"This purchase was a splurge for me, and I was hopeful that it would be an upgrade from the Charge 2 that I had been using., What a disappointment. It often inaccurately logs my exercise. Running routes that I know are a mile it will occasionally track as three-quarters of a mile. Not always, just occasionally. It only rarely measures all of my sleep, and I have tried all of the suggestions for fixing that, from wiping the sensors, to resetting to factory settings, to even deleting my account and reinstalling the app and the Fitbit. I am saving money for another tracker, and it won't be a Fitbit.",2
1,"Bought it for my wife for Christmas 2019 and she's been wearing it every day. Up to time of writing this Fitbit versa 2 is amazing. You get phone notifications and can even respond to texts straight from your versa 2 by speaking out whatever you want to say. It works in tandem with her charge 2, so whichever she has on will compile steps for example and sync with each other so all data is collected. It has some other cool features that I can't remember now. Surpassed expectations.",5
0,"I thought that I liked the product because I didn't have any problems with it. Then for no reason at all the screen popped out. Now I got this in 2020 in October or later, so I haven't had this for a year.Their customer service is horrible. I tried the call and their standard practice is what is your name (first and last) what is your email address and someone other than me will generate an email to contact you back. During this time, I am not sure the associate wrote my name down because they asked me my name no less than four times. Then, when asked the simplest questions of when I would hear back I received no date.I had to call back and then my call was dropped. Then, I tried their chat and then it was kinda helpful. Of course they wanted a review then and I refused because I knew they were going to try to use the positive experience before they ultimately tell me that they were not going to fix or replace my fitbit that is less than a year old.In summary, get an apple watch because someone can help and you can get assistance. I actually want to leave less than a star.",1
1,"I like the devise and this replaced my Versa. The app won’t allow custom heart rate zone monitoring with alerts. That feature has never worked, wish they would fix it. The heart rate monitor on the Versa 2 isn’t great and not as good as my last device. It seems to be all over the place and has trouble updating with the Spo2 clock face which I like very much. It does what I need for the most part. Look forward to the technology catching up to the features. Still an economical choice for a fitness watch.",4
1,"After about a year, I had some problems with charging. It would give me an error message that there was insufficient power, no matter where/how I manipulated the plugs, and after cleaning the charging connectors with a lint free cloth.Yesterday, barely two years in, just no charge at all.I've tried all the tricks I've found online to do a hard reset. Nothing.It's bricked.",3
1,"Bought her this for Mother’s Day. She loves it and has only taken it off to recharge it. She wanted it to track steps and sleep. When I bought it, I had no idea that it also forwards text messages from the iPhone to the watch and also alerts her that she’s getting a phone call on the iPhone. We were both pleasantly surprised. She likes the pretty pink color too. I’m VERY happy I got this. She loves it! One of her favorite Mother’s Day gifts of all time.",5
1,"I've had the fitbit for a few days now and my only complaint is that the battery does not seem to last as long as they say. Not even close. I know some things impact that such as using max bright light, a clock that is video but ive not been doing that. I did have a digital clock face and took it off and picked another, my lighting is set to normal and at night I turn off the motion senor so every time i move the watch wont just turn on. I fully charged the battery yesterday and today im at 79% battery life. So will see how it does this time but im concerned that it seems im having to charge it as much as the fitbit versa version.",4
1,"My friend bought this watch and I thought it looked so classy and I loved the color. After she told me about all the features I bought one as well and I have never been disappointed. For me this color goes with anything in my wardrobe and I never tire of looking at how beautiful it is. I love the larger face and time, also that it vibrates when I have a call in case I don’t have the volume on my phone turned on. I also track my steps and sleep habits with this, the six day battery charge is a game changer, so much better than the older models.",5
0,"First, the music app's don't work with out a paid subscription even though they work with out a subscription on my phone and computer. No problem...I will transfer music on my computer to the Versa 2. Problem number two...Versa 2 will not connect to my 5G network. Great! If I had just wanted a step counter and sleep monitoring I might as well have just bought a cheap fitness tracker...I'd be a lot less fustrated after 4 hours of trying to connect. This is Bull $#1T!",2
1,I have been a Fitbit user for years! Mine recently broke and immediately replaced it. I was irresponsible and used the Fitbit in a hot tub but this is water proof with safe temperatures! I’ve had my previous Fitbit for over 2 years and had older models as well. I bought the Versa 2 again since I have been happy with it prior to it breaking. Totally worth it and love all the functions it has!,5
1,"Loved my Versa 2 that died after 3 years. Versa 3 has great app and easy to read watch.#1. I wonder about accuracy. After sitting behind wheel of RV for 9 1/2 hours. My Fitbit gave me credit for 9 active hours and 10,000 steps. The only time I walked was getting out of the cab and pumping gas.#2. My wife and I have identical watches. We hiked side by side and I always get .2-.3 more miles than she does. Stride lengths are set at automatic. It stands to reason she gets more steps than I. She should have the same mileage.",4
1,"I wanted a pedometer that also showed heart rate. The Versa2 does that, and has additional fun features, too!It tells me how much sleep I get, and the quality of my sleep. It also tells me how many calories I’ve burned each day. (I think that’s a somewhat conservative number.) It vibrates when I’ve been sitting still too long, and also when I have an incoming text or call, which I also find useful. I can also check the weather before I head out the door. And, I can track my route when I’m out with my dog.I don’t pay extra for “premium” so can’t evaluate that. But I’m happy with the basic functionality.",5
1,"I've had this watch in my cart for quite some time and finally decided to purchase it about a month ago. It was a pain to set up, had to buy a new phone (I've had the same one for about 5-6 yrs so it was time anyways) just to get it to work and now half the time my app won't sync with the fitbit. I like the features of getting my messages on it,especially at work. It seems to be counting my steps and activities well.I do have one huge problem with this watch- every once in awhile it will shock or zap my skin. not a reminder to move, I get sudden and sharp pain radiating throughout my wrist and hand to the point that it stops me from doing anything. As much as I like this watch I may have to stop using it as I fear it may burn me.",3
1,"So far, so good, although I'm coming from an old Flex 2 so hardware alone it's a big improvement. Noticed that the different watch faces cause the battery consumption to increase ... dramatically for some. Think I'll stick with the default for now and maybe try out the ""by Fitbit"" ones later. No biggie. Tracking seems to be going okay.Biggest gripe, for now, is the placement of the side button on the left side rather than the right, like where a normal watch has its winding/adjustment stem. Thought there would be a setting to flip the screen. Nope. Researching found that this ""feature"" is also on other Fitbit models, too. Very awkward for a right-handed person to thumb press when worn on the left (which I would imagine would be close to the 90% stats). So multiple models and updates and still disregarded. I know, just a small thing, but you would think its an easy fix. 1 star deducted.",4
1,"Very chic and nice design,it looks bigger online than the reality,it does fit perfectly!",5
0,"Total bust so far. I've been trying to set it up for half an hour. Plug in the charger and attach the device, there's zero indication that it's charging so I guess you're just supposed to hope that it is. At first it showed up on my app, then it didn't. Again, I'm guessing because there are no indicators whatsoever, but maybe the device is dead.Seriously wish the idiots developing these things would put an iota of thought into logic when making these devices. Who wants to just guess of their device is charging? Who wants to just guess at how to do setup because there's no setup guide included? Spoiler alert: no one.",1
0,"I read the reviews and was excited to get watch. Liked all the features it was suppose to do. I can only get certain parts to work. I called Fitbit for help. The customer service people are very nice and patient. But we can not get the weather to set up. So I am in a ""holding"" pattern till they get back to me. I'm sure it is a great watch but I did want it to do more. I will let you know as we move forward , at some point. So far, it does my heart, steps and calories. It does not stay connected and I have to call to get help. Very Disappointed. I wish I had gotten the Apple watch.",1
1,Really liked my Versa 1 so I upgraded to Versa 2 and love it. Improvements are incremental but seems much more polished and accurate. Inclusion of fitbit pay on all versions is nice and seems to work well. Sleep and heart rate in particular seem more accurate. My only complaint is the silicone band (this applies to either version). I much prefer a nylon breathable strap with velcro closure available for under $10 bucks on Amazon (very similar to Apple watch band). I've bought a couple as gifts at super (and continuing) black friday prices,5
0,Just received my versa yesterday and am returning it. Number one battery won't fully charge. I tried all the fixes posted online. Number two I cannot get this to update. I've tried on two different devices. If the app doesn't crash then it loses it synch. I shouldn't have to spend over five hours trying to get this to update. After 24 hours of charging the battery should be full not medium. Wish I had never bought this literal piece of junk,1
0,"I upgraded from the original Versa for 1 main reason, the battery life. The secondary reason was for Alexa built in. I expected the new AMOLED screen to be better than the original but let me tell you, it is dark even on brightest settings and whites look grayish compared to my original Versa. I bought this on Cyber Monday for a substantial discount. If I would have paid the normal price I would have returned it in a second. I use the ""Trekkie"" clock face and the comparison in color depth and brightness is horrible on the Gen2. Other than that everything works great but if you can't see the face well, what's the point. Maybe I will return it.",2
0,"Would only sync about half the time on my LG V20 and then locked up. Some days the Versa 2 would auto sync and other days I had to reset the WiFi or reboot my phone to sync. Twice I called their ""Tech Support"" to reinstall the Versa 2 on my phone then on Jan 1, 2020 the watch locked up displaying a red circle with a red X. FitBit then informed me that my LG V20 was not on their compatible list but the older model LG V10 is. At first they suggested I get another phone then clarified that I should borrow a compatible phone and see if I had the same issues. i.e. blame it on my phone not their defective not ready for prime time product .",1
0,"I had the original versa for over 2 years and was very pleased with it. When it died, I replaced it with this versa 2. Sleep tracking seems to be the only thing it does with some accuracy. When I am doing landscaping all day and get 15,000 steps, it claims I have zero active minutes. It's also bigger than the original versa which is disappointing. The screen is the same size but the watch is thicker so it sticks out from my wrist further. Overall, I'm pretty disappointed.Update: more inaccuracy. I wore the watch on the treadmill. I walked 2.0 miles at 3.5 miles per hour. The versa 2 logged it as 1.71 miles at 2.8 miles per hour.",2
1,"So it’s day 2 and I can’t say anything negative at all about my actual Fitbit versa 2. This is my second product and the first Fitbit (charge 4) that I got was a gift. So yes, I like them. Well... when unboxing I thought since I spent over 200$ on a watch it would come equipped. Yah know, with the necessities... why I don’t have a USB wall plug adapter for the charging plug for my device is unbeknownst to me. Which is really silly to me. Why doesn’t that come with the kit? What if you don’t have a laptop, or if all your other adapters for other plugs are just that .. for other plugs? Anywho, if I have any problems I’ll definitely do an update.",4
0,"This device was fine while it worked. It did everything as advertised. Unfortunately the heart rate sensor stopped working after only one year of light use. No physical damage to the device, it just simply stopped working one day. I tried all the troubleshooting steps I could find online with no success, and so I finally contacted Fitbit's support.Their support team, who is frustrating and could not wait to finish up their very brief chat with me, took me through the same troubleshooting steps that I told them I had already tried. They concluded that they would have to look into my account and get back to me. Later that day they sent me an email saying my device (again, only one year old) is out of warranty and could not be replaced. Instead they sent me a 35% discount voucher. No thanks, I'll try someone else.",2
1,"This is a nice smart watch and it has its pros and it’s cons. The fact that you can only answer text on the watch if you have a Android. Is very disappointing to say the least. I love iPhone and dislike android. But I like fit bit, I can still see text and WhatsApp and messenger messages. So I’m fine with it for now. The other thing I don’t like is it doesn’t know when I’m working out. I have to go into an app on the watch and tell it I’m working out. Which sometimes is very aggravating. It should know I’m working out already since it can sense my movements and heart rate, but it doesn’t. Other than those really it’s a good watch. It does a lot, just wish it was more compatible with iPhone.",5
1,"Love my FitBit! HOWEVER.... I seem to be having an allergic reaction to the band. I saw some other reviews with the same issue. It's only when I workout, too. So I'm assuming the sweat is also a factor in it. But other than that drawback, I really love this watch. I went from a Galaxy watch to this and it run so much smoother and has almost the same features with text to speech, quick replies, and counts calories way better than the Galaxy. It's so light also and stylish. Super happy with my purchase (except for the band giving me an itchy wrist when i workout)",4
1,I bought this to track how well I was doing with physical and cardio exercise. An unexpected bonus was the phone location feature. Since I live in the mountains and can't get a landline (to use in locating where I laid my phone down) and have a tendency to misplace it....frequently....I was as excited to get this feature as I was to learn how well I working out!,5
0,"This was my 5th fitbit in 3 years, I have had terrible luck with them. I don't get them wet. This one stopped working today and of course my support ended 4 days ago. I should have contacted them when I was having problems with it connecting to my phone and not tracking my sleep over the last several months. No more fitbits for me!!",1
0,After 18 months of normal use the watch no longer powers on. It cycles the logo on and off as seen in the photo. I spoke to Fitbit support and they have no solution. Really not tech savvy when it comes to their product. They sent me a link and said try which proved to be worthless and that was it. They will replace the watch if I agree to buy another at a discounted price. What kind of warranty is this? It's like buying a watch with a built in death switch.,1
0,"I had my Versa 2 for about a year and half ago. I waved my arm yesterday and the entire face of my watch flew off. I contacted Fitbit because in the past their customer service and product reliability was fantastic. However, this is no longer the case.

It is disappointing that Fitbit no longer backs their products.",1

I contacted customer support and asked them to make an exception. While they were very courteous, the supervisor did not allow them to make an exception and said they couldn't do anything for me other than offering a 35% discount to buy a new watch. If I'm going to spend money on a new fitness tracker, I will be going with a different brand, probably a Garmin, since this is my second fitbit that broke after the 1 year warranty was up.",2
0,"Very disappointed. This thing barely passed as a watch. Half the watch faces you try to download freeze the mobile app, which then loses connection to the watch which then drains the battery. Also the water logging is broken the watch only reports in ML, when you're in the settings screen and your display times out some other AOD comes up with a smaller clock. Lack of customization is a major issue. Just make a default clock that looks clean that we can customize the stats and the color. This is not a techies watch, this is a watch for people who like iPhones and enjoy vanilla ice cream.Also the weather app is terribly inaccurate!",2
0,"Really disappointed in the lack of Windows 10 support, for syncing via USB. When it doesn't sync it gives you a link to ""fix it"" which is useless.I really miss my Fitbit Surge. The battery barely makes it through 24 hours. So the sleep tracking is a joke, since it needs to be charged. When it needs firmware upgrade if it Windows 10 and USB sync support it would probably be a snap, but as is it is a huge disappointment. This will probably be my last fitbit watch.",2
0,My FitBit Versa 2 does not sync properly. I really dislike that I have to open my phone app if I want to see my sleep. The hours very seldom show up the watch display itself even if I manually sync. Sleep tracking in general has been very inaccurate even though I have it set to to highly sensitive and positioned in the suggested position on my arm. I used to have the Flex and I have to say I am missing it. Disappointed as I was so excited for the Versa. Not sure if mine is just faulty or not as my family members have the Versa2 and love it. Considering returning.,2
0,"I purchased the watch in October 2019 and all was well. Around February 2020, I started having issues with the watch not syncing correctly. As an app feature you are able to take part in fitness challenges, while my individual dash would register my steps, the challenges were not showing the same steps. Fast forward to the last 4 weeks, and now I am unable to sync to the App which again seems like not that big of a deal, but now this week when I sync I am losing over 50% of my steps. As a consequence in order to avoid losing my steps I had to unpair the watch from my phone, which means the whole purpose of the ""smart watch"" which ""should"" come with features such as receiving texts messages and emails, phone calls, calendar alerts etc goes out the window, because in order to take advantage of those feature you have to be paired to your mobile device. So I am basically left with an overly priced pedometer; and no help from Fitbit who has complaints on their own site as far back as December 2019 on this same issue. I have only come across issues being reported with the Versa 2 so just a friendly heads up here! If you mind being unable to sync, and not being able to enjoy the benefits of having a smart watch then you should proceed with caution, or at least do your research and make sure the 6+ month old issue has been resolved.",1
1,"I do like the fitbit very much. It arrived as I expected. I've had several fitbits and they've all worked great, but the down side, they don't seem to last very long. To be fair, their customer service is really good. I've had no problems with them. I had the versa lite and lasted 13 months. Now I have the versa 2, it lasted about 3 months. This is the second replacement I've received from fitbit. I just wish they would last longer.",4
0,"It took me one hour to change the band on my wife's watch and on the Fitbit forum there are hundreds with the same complaint. We have had other Fitbit trackers and watches and my wife can change the band on her Alta in a matter of seconds. To change the band on the Versa requires three very strong hands. In terms of accuracy, my wife and I go on a walk together (I have a Fitbit Ionic) and my watch records 1.3 miles and her Versa records 0.99 miles. Checking against the google map, the Ionic is correct. It seems that Fitbit fumbled the ball on this model.",2
1,"I have had the Fitbit Versa 2 for 2 months. The primary purpose was sleep and exercise tracking. This has made a great impact on tracking these sources. Sleeping - has helped a lot with identifying times that I got up in the night, and how long I was actually awake. Allowed me to modify evening routines to increase the chances of longer sleep, and the correct sleep distribution (REM/Light/Deep). As for exercise, I use t polar beat heart rate monitor to compare the two results. Running in a hilly area has identified the number of flights I ended up climbing/jogging. When did I take breaks along the path, and overall pace.Interesting statistic was the resting heart rate, and how after stabilizing the exercise routine, I could see a good reduction in the resting heart rate.Over all I am happy with the product! It is a effective tool to maintain overall fitness.",5
0,First I could not set this up myself. I paid a tech to set it up then discovered that tracking REM sleep required a $10 per month subscription. I'm sorry I cheaped out and bought this watch - $10 per month adds up fast and it is not easy to use. I see no way to get product support. For me it was a total waste of money and it took so long for me to get it set up I'm past the return date. My friends have Apple watches and love them.,2
0,"I upgraded from Versa to Versa 2, big mistake. The Versa does almost everything that the Versa 2 will do but my big complaint is that the Versa 2 will not work with the Fitbit App on a Windows PC. I chatted with a somewhat rude Fitbit tech to confirm that Versa 2 does not work with a Windows PC. My Versa worked fine but I got such a great deal on the Versa 2 I decided to ""upgrade"". I my case, it was a downgrade. I use the App on a PC much more than I do on my iPhone or tablet so the Versa 2 was a great disappointment.",2
1,"I love using my new Fitbit! It did exactly what I needed it to right out of the box and there’s plenty of additional apps and settings you can add through the mobile app, including watch face customization. The only thing I wish I could do is send texts through the watch instead of my iPhone. I could have gone with an Apple Watch to get that additional functionality, but it’s just not worth the steep price tag to me. I’m very happy with the low to mid-tier pricing of the FitBit Versa 2, for this price it does everything I want it to.",5
0,I spoke with Fitbit support today. They have no intention on fixing this - it's not a bug it's a feature. iPhone users must manually sync the Fitbit versa 2 and we won't experience the advertised great battery life. Fitbit removed the option to auto-sync on the app. Without the ability to sync the watch- you won't receive messages or have access to Spotify etc.. iPhone users won't be able to sync unless you go into the app and continually sync/log in to your wifi - yes I've uninstalled and reinstalled and spent about 40 minutes on the phone with them today. This is just what it is- there is no fix. The versa 2 is less a smartwatch and more a C student situation.. it tells time and that's about all it does reliably. Buyer beware.,1
1,The device has a good size and weight as I don't like overly large watches. Great options for aftermarket bands etc. The battery life is not so great. The display looks good however its hard to see in sunlight and as with many hard to see with polarized sunglasses on. Always on watch face is good option but again sometimes hard to see and the font is an outline of numbers to save battery. I had this and an Amazfit bip that I paid 1/3 the price for.. I just sold the versa2 at a loss and still wear the other. Not worth it. Not enough extra features to pay the price compared to other fitness/smart watches.,3
1,"I started off with the fitbit charge 4 and quickly upgraded to the versa 2. The versa 2 is a great fitness tracker and gives you all the stats you need. I upgraded to the versa 2 because I also wanted a watch that could show me my phone notifications (texts, calls, emails, etc). My phone is a Galaxy S10 and the versa 2 syncs perfectly with it. The included band is fine, but I upgraded to a protective band to prevent damage to my watch. Love my versa 2! Definitely a good buy.",5
0,"The watch won't connect to my phone. I've tried several times and it won't work. I'm disappointed in this watch, I spent money on a device that I can't fully appreciate because it doesn't function to full capacity. I've only had it a month and it never connected. I don't want my money back, I just want a Versa2 that works. I'm pissed!",2
0,"This is my second Fitbit purchase and you know what they say, fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice...I bought this Versa 2 in Feb 2020, it's Oct 2021 and it's malfunctioning. The Charge 3 I had before this also quit functioning less than 2 years after I bought it. They are built to fail and I'm not going to give them my money anymore. There are better products on the market. Save yourself the hassle and buy something else.",1
0,"Loved the watch when it worked. I’m not an athlete but I felt like monitoring my steps helped me move more at work. Also, liked the text notification portion. The Uber app didn’t really work that well and was just easier to use the phone (especially since you have to have your phone on you for it to work). I also liked the health metrics and exercise tracking.However, the 1 star is because after a little under 2 years it has stopped working. First the heart rate stopped working and I contacted Fitbit, followed their instructions, and it still dosesn’t work. Now the screen is coming undone on the watch. The same thing happened to my boyfriends watch. He also went swimming in his and got water inside it and it stopped working. I’d suggest getting a better product or the warranty AO you can get it replaced if you plan on using it longer than 2 years.",1
0,"The media could not be loaded.
 Bought a Fitbit Versa 2 in June of 2021 to help track my running and sleep. For the most part I enjoyed the increased utility of the screen interface and the improved accuracy in data collection. It was great while running to change songs and track my heart rate. However as of today (December 1, 2021) the screen no longer works. While the device still syncs with the app and appears to be collecting data such as heart rate and step count, the device cannot be accessed without the app. Despite resetting the device and attempting to connect it to the charger, the Fitbit no longer works. Very disappointed with this purchase. I would recommend that people either pony up the extra money for the warranty program or look elsewhere for better priced and more durable wearable fitness trackers. I do not think I will be purchasing another product from Fitbit.",1
0,This is the worst fit bit ever I've not had it barley a month and it has stopped working... Not a happy camperDO NOT BUY I HAD TO GIVE IT A star STARS BUT I REALLY MEAN 0... AWEFUL WATCH....,1
1,"I've been a sport and physical activity lover since pee wee league and never really felt the need for one of these. But, since I took up cycling again; I have to say that I love what this watch can do as far as metrics go. It tracks pretty well not perfect but good for the price. I wish the apps were more. than the ones pre installed. That's the one thing I really didn't like but overall its a good watch. I'll upgrade once I drive it around the block a few times. Recommend it , yes.",4
0,"The watch lasted 6 months and the display went bad and was hot to the touch. You can only reach support by email. They replied and had me ship the watch to their facilities. Received the watch back after more than a month and was unable to pair it with the Fitbit App. It will not Sync with Bluetooth. I am technically savvy with computers and electronics but this watch won’t sync. Emailed Support and have not heard back from them. The watch went in for repairs on July 6th and it is August 19, 2020 and no contact from their support. I will make sure I NEVER Buy a FitBit product again.",2
1,"I have had this watch for less than a month and it is already damaged. The screen got scratched on my kitchen counter. If it cannot even handle the indoors, how will it handle a hike?It seems less accurate than the alta. I have steps before I even get out of bed. That never happened with the alta. And my alta never got damaged anyway I had it for many many years. I gave it to my mom when I got this one so it still works.I wanted more features like the heart rate monitor but it was not worth the upgrade. Sure, it does more but why? Why do I need those things?",3
1,I was skeptical at first to even purchase this watch but I went ahead and did it and boy was I glad it works as good as it said it does I love having Alexa right there I can ask you to remind me things the sleep app is fantastic it really does track all your sleep habits I even took a nap in the afternoon and a track that very impressed with this watch at this price. It also has a lot of apps that you’re able to download and change your clock face up to three different faces great watch,4
1,Happy enough with it. There are things that could definitely be improved on but it keeps track of what I wanted so it will do fine. Seems a bit pricey for what the software offers. My husband & son have garmin watches that offer much more for around the same price. GPS tracking is spotty & fails to connect sometimes. Battery is no where near what they promised. I have to charge almost daily. Have to do a lot of work to connect it to other apps. The alexa option is only reason I am keeping it,4
1,It works fine for what it is. I bought it to replace my Apple Watch which would not pair with my new phone bc the watch was old and couldn’t update. I was not happy with Apple for that reason so I thought I’d try this. I just miss the additional functionality of my Apple Watch. May break down and buy another. This has Alexa but it doesn’t activate by my voice and when I raise my hand to see the time it doesn’t always turn on. It’s a little frustrating.,3
1,Great smart watch. I use to have a fitbit awhile back and loved it. I was comparing smartwatches for awhile now and wanted to go back to fitbit. Even though the price is up there but i rather have a watch that i know i will have no issues with. Fitbit is very accurate and love the fit of it. Can't go wrong with it. The mibile app is eady to use. The sleep tracking is accurate as well. All the other smart features is a bonus for me. I get to have fun using the watch while working out.,4
1,"I like the look of this one, it’s a lot sleeker than the Ionic I was using. I don’t really care much that I can’t control my music using the device, and I don’t have a Spotify account so... that’s kinda meh, but what I really miss is that it doesn’t tell me when I’m in different heart rate zones. I found that useful. I’m not how accurate the pedometer is. I can just be sitting on the couch and it’ll congratulate me for reaching my hourly step goal",4
0,I bought this in July and now in December it will not connect to my phone. I tried to reset it it and that did not work. Tried to contact customer support and it was difficult and not helpful. Would not buy unless you are looking to waste money.,1
0,"Update: This watch lasted me a grand total of 18 months. I don't recommend it at all!The watch itself is fine. It's the operating/support software that is pure crap. Aside from the watch interface itself, you also have to install a mobile app, desktop app and yet still use the website. Not one of the those interfaces can manage all settings. Also, to get to settings is like passing through a maze. Imagine they have created a whole tab just for Covid 19 updates, but yet not one for basic settings. You literally have to use all 4 interfaces for different things. And don't get me started on integrating with other apps like MyFitnessPal or Strava. It is a pure PAIN! You have to go through multiple troubleshooters to actually get that to work and once it does, don't expect that it will continue to. I won't buy this again. It's turning out to be more of a headache than anything else.",1
0,"I really like the battery life. Battery life is one feature that makes me hesitate to ever switch over to apple. Connectivity, on the other hand is absolutely frustrating... I rarely can use Alexa because it says it is not connected. Requires you to keep the Fitbit open to use Alexa, and even when you do, it rarely works.Giving this watch 2 stars just because of this connectivity issue might seem excessive. But this issue might be what convinces me to switch to apple.",2
0,"I Thank Fitbit for taking the time to write me back and offer me a discount. Since this is my second Fitbit that broke and both were not covered with warranty, I don't intend to purchase any of their products ever again.I no longer want to experience and be fooled by a company's product that breaks soon after the warranty period for the third time.Rest assured, I shall post this in my social media to forewarn people I know not to buy your product.",1
1,"This is a stylish relatively inexpensive watch that provides great information about things like steps taken in a day, BPM, exercise, sleep quality and more. There are several apps included with the watch, such as Pandora and Spotify and you can easily add more. I enjoy using the Alexa feature, but it took a while to realize that you must keep your app running in the background of your phone in order for it to work.There are hundreds of different clock faces to choose from. Most cost about $1.50, but many are available for free.Great battery life. Been wearing it for three full days and am at 50%.",5
0,"The watch itself worked fine I guess, but their advertisement said it works with Android phones and some iphones. I have a Motorola G7 power which is no galaxy or anything but it's an Android 9 and it had just come out last year, so it should have been compatible according to their advertising. But it wasn't. I had to call customer service since it wasn't letting me get my notifications and after the second time calling they told me it's not compatible. So just make sure your phone is compatible before purchasing. Returning something purchased online is a pain so the fact that their advertising failed me is the reason I didn't give it a higher rating.",1
0,I bought this because I could use it during aqua fitness and swimming and other non impact exercise. I’m not sure how accurate it is. Take a leisurely walk with my dog and looks like I have fat burn or cardio. Wear it on non recumbent bike. Sweat like crazy and bike reading says I’m in the zone. Watch says below zone rate. Same in pool. Wouldn’t buy another.,2
0,"I've had several Fitbit devices in the past that worked just fine, but this current device doesn't track sleep accurately when others before have. The problem during the pandemic is that Fitbit customer service is totally unresponsive. Days go by with little or no response, and when it comes, the answers are always 'canned'. Over and over I get the same suggestions you can find on their forums. So now I'm stuck with a device that doesn't work, for the function that was most important to me, with no customer service. Won't be buying another Fitbit.",2
0,"This Fitbit was a huge disappointment. The sleep tracker was fairly accurate, although I must sleep walk because I woke to having taken a couple hundred steps before getting out of bed in the morning. The main reason I bought the Versa 2 was to count my steps. This Fitbit counts step when your walking, driving (I’m not Fred Flintstone) and also if you use your hands when talking. That is the reason for one star for accuracy.",2
1,Purchased for my wife for Christmas and she loves it but I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because now I have to listen to her tell me about her sleep pattern every morning,4
0,Fitbit worked great for 3months called customer service after it factory reset itself. Dealt with them for 2 days for them to tell me ooo your phone is not compatible. We can look into the warranty. What good is that to replace the same device that is now not compatible? Very disappointed customer. On day of calling the lady said I have no record of you calling yesterday. I said how is that and I have a case number. Then spoke to a supervisor and she gave me the same bs all of a sudden the phone call gets disconnected and they never called back. Customer service is awful!!!,1
0,1. I wish it would show time without having to install app.2. Description said that it needs Android 7 to work. I had Galaxy note s with Android 7 on it and it still didn't work.I bought new phone where I upgraded to Android 8I after couple days I was able to make it work. Watch kept disconnecting randomly. I almost returned it but after 2 days of trying it finally upgraded the app and it is working.3. Music App another issue.I don't have good signal at work so one of main reasons for me getting this watch was to put some music on it.Getting the PC app to communicate with watch was another hassle and it still is.However I was able to get some Mp3s on it and now I can (with issues) listen to them.Every now and then the song just drops and I have to pair my wireless headphones with watch again so I can continue to play it.4. Battery life seems to be only about 4 to 5 days that is if you don't play music on it.If you play 8 hrs of music on it you need to charge it every night otherwise you will run out of power next day.I was looking at Galaxy watch also but it didn't have best reviews also and it needs 3rd party apps for most things.Even though I had so many issues with this watch I don't think that there is any other watch that is better for the money because surprisingly in 2019 technology is not there yet.Nice clock faces though.,2
1,*The sleep tracker is not accurate. *Understandably though it counts when you are laying down watching tv before falling asleep.*A positive is you can edit your sleep times. *Although you can't track your heartbeats unless you sign up to be a Fitbit member. *Unfortunately majority of the apps that are already on the Fitbit you have to sign up as a member(pay) in order for you to use.*You can't make phone calls.*You can accept phone calls.*You can't talk through the watch.*You can't initiate texts through the watch. *Although you can reply to text messages if someone texts you first.**over all I am happy with the Fitbit,4
1,"This is my first FitBit and I love it! I wasn’t used to wearing a watch, especially to bed, but I got used to it. And I really like the silicone band, it’s soft and flexible and not as sweaty as I thought it might be. I got this to help me lose weight, keep active and maintain that weight, and it’s an awesome reminder of my goals. I check the app all the time, log my water, I could log my food. It nudges me to move if I haven’t in an hour. And it vibrates and celebrates when I hit 10,000 steps. It has a timer, alarm, exercise tracker, and many apps like Spotify and Alexa.",5
1,I absolutely LOVE this! I waitress 6 days a week for 8 hours a day and I'm not allowed to have my phone on me. This Versa 2 pushes all of my messages through so that I can read and respond to them without getting onto trouble.,5
1,"My husband wanted a ""smart watch"" that he could get his texts on...I wasn't going to spend several hundred dollars on one so I got him this one. It is a good fitness tracker for the money, I ended up buying one for myself. The functionality is pretty basic, but it tells steps, heart rate, and calories burned. Messages come through but the speech to text is a glitchy. Overall, it's a good tracker.",5
1,"Overall, I love the watch—especially the fitness and sleep features. I like the design, responsiveness, and battery life.As other reviewers noted, the Spotify integration is a joke! I also found that downloading music to the watch was very cumbersome. Had to do it on my MacBook and it took forever.But my biggest disappointment is the Alexa integration which is very spotty. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t. I hope they will improve this with a software update in the future.",4
1,"This is my first smartwatch and I got it for basic tracking of stats, workouts, etc. (I do not have it linked up to receive messages/alerts from my phone and I don't intend to.) I found it pretty easy to set up and the app is user-friendly and appealing to browse through your stats and history. I've used the Alexa feature very sparingly, though at times when I used a voice command to set an alarm (ie ""set an alarm for 5min"") it didn't actually go off; at times the water intake tracking also seems to miss some inputs--this isn't consistent though. I've only used it for a few short runs so far but it did provide different mileage than another running app I was using--I'm a little concerned about this but haven't gone on enough runs/tested it out to say that this is a for sure issue. I am impressed at the battery life; I do not have the screen display on automatically (and again not receiving phone alerts) and I would say on a full charge, it's usually at least six days before I need to charge it again. Prior to this watch, I wasn't a 24/7 watch-wearer but this is comfortable and I hardly notice that I basically never take it off.",4
1,"Edit- USER ERROR - There seemed to be an update need for the device. I am one to admit my mistakes. After the update the battery is holding strong and the front face which temporarily went black has returned to normally.Battery failing. I have only had this fitbit since October and the battery is already failing at the end of January and will not keep a charge. This may be an issue with the Vera 2 overall but after only 3-4 months, this is really unacceptable.",5
1,"I had a Fitbit Inspire HR for the last year (super durable, no issues), and I decided to upgrade to a newer one since I'm getting more into being active. I LOVE this! I did have a bit of an issue getting it to connect through Bluetooth, but a couple minutes with Fitbit's support chat and one phone restart I was up and running! I LOVE how many options for clock faces there are, the one in my picture was paid for (less than $4 for TWELVE clock faces!) But there are plenty that are free and really cool. You can connect your Spotify account (pretty sure you need Spotify Premium though) and control it through the Fitbit, which is super helpful because while I'm lifting weights I don't want to keep pulling my phone out of my pocket and changing the song, I can just do it right from my wrist! There's also Fitbit Pay, you can add your own music right to it (haven't tried yet but I'm looking forward to it) and there's just sooo many apps you can download to it for all sorts of things, even some games! I definitely recommend this if you're in the market for a fitness tracker! It also looks like an Apple Watch without the price which I love 😉",5
1,"And I bought a cheaper version for $25 and it was horrible not even remotely accurate. So I bit the bullet and got the Fitbit versa two. Very pleased with the interface, the accuracy , the app and the community of friends through the app are awesome! It’s like your own little social media cheerleading section! Very pleased with the feel - not to heavy. I did have to buy another band because my wrist is a weird size where the holes in the band are either too small or too large so I went with an adjustable metal band I found and it’s perfect. Now all I have to do is remember to wear it!!",5
1,"I love the Fitbit Versa 2! I think what I love most about it is it's ability to last for days. The only thing that I don't really like is that it's compatibility with apple products ins't that good. I know, if I wanted it to be compatible with my iPhone, I should have bought an apple watch. But that is one thing I would love to see Fitbit do is become more cross compatible. The sleep tracking is really nice. It allows me to really analyze, and see just what's going on with my sleep, and it helps me better my habits. The mobile app is really nice as well. One other thing I don't like is that Alexa does not work unless you have the Fitbit app running in the background. I tend to just always close them out, so it would be nice for it to work, at least basic functions, like set a timer or whats the weather, but it doesn't. All around, I think it's a great watch for really anyone. It's great for those who want to use its exercise features, to track sleep, or to just all around have smart watch. I highly recommend the watch to anyone buying it!",5
1,"The Fitbit is nice to look at. I really like the sleep tracker, heart rate and O2 monitors. My problem is, in order to get the full function, you have to put out more money. The music feature requires a Spotify premium account in order to utilize. Most of the supporting apps cost money. This is not what I expected.",3
1,"If you have an I phone I would just fit the bill for an Apple Watch.Sure I loved mine in the beginning, the heart rate & sleep tracker is amazing. But after about a year the heart rate no longer works , then it won't track my sleep, doesn't think I'm working out unless running. Lastly I think getting text on it are awesome but it's useless to answer anything.I also believe it isn't tracking steps correctly.",3
1,"Fitbit Versa 2 is a nice upgrade to the Fitbit family. This gives me what I need. Steps, miles, calories, heart rate, etc. I have tried to use some of the apps but the watch face interface is not as smooth as I have seen in the apple watches. But when you at the massive price difference between the two products, I can't really complain about Fitbit. Super great value for the money.I still wear it every day.",5
1,"I wanted so badly to love it but unfortunately, it's getting returned. It tracks sleep, calories, and steps great but it's completely inaccurate when tracking distance. The first night I received it, I went on a walk and did a 1 mile loop. It tracked the loop at 1.05 miles which isn't too far off and I felt satisfied with it. The next time I did the same loop 3x and it tracked 2.70 miles, the third time I did the same loop once around it tracked it at .62 miles. I called fitbit to see if they could explain or help me trouble shoot the problem, I was told to restart the device and restart my phone and then everything would work properly. Unfortunately, this didn't help and it still tracks mileage inaccurately and inconsistently. I need a product that I can rely on and the fitbit just isn't reliable.",3
1,"Simple. User friendly. Battery lasts for 3 days at a time. Charges fast. I use it mainly for tracking my workouts and really love the ""find my phone"" feature. I have a very small wrist and was leery about this working for me, but I'm pleasantly surprised how well it fits. I use the second to last band holes, so it can fit an even smaller wrist than mine. I'd definitely buy again.",5
0,"This watch sounds too good to be true because it is. Alexa doesn’t really work, you can’t see your text messages and will rarely get notifications, and it doesn’t calculate all of your steps. I was so happy with my charge 2, but after two days of having this watch, I returned it.On the other hand, the battery life is phenomenal and the sleep monitoring is better than any other watch I’ve tried.I just personally couldn’t justify buying a watch that couldn’t perform all of the functions it claims to be able to.My grandpa bought one too and returned his a week later. He said the heart rate monitor didn’t work accurately.",1
1,"Fitbit versa 2 has alexa but you spend most of the time fighting to keep it linked so right now it's pretty worthless. Don't believe the sleep app is totally accurate but ok. Bluetooth works well, have linked it to several speakers, but some earbuds don't respond to volume on fitbit. Am buying a small speaker to connect to my coat zipper since earbuds bother my ears after a while. Instructions are really worthless and tracker can be a problem. Spent a lot of time reading other reports to fix problems and still find alexa pretty worthless even with phone right beside watch and yes they say my phone is compatible. Updates are ungodly slow even with really highspeed internet and plan on repeating update at least twice. Probably should have got apple phone.",3
0,"There are so many things I love about the Versa 2. I wish I could give it 5 stars. It’s attractive, love all the features, 3rd party watch faces, band options, etc. BUT...IT DOESN’T LAST. My first Versa lasted just under a year. My beautiful Versa 2 lasted just under 6 months. I take good care of my products, don’t drop them, take them off at night, etc. I’ve had 6 Fitbits in 6 years. 2 Ones, 2 Altas, 2 Versas. What does that tell you? Their lifespan is terrible. So, I’m done with Fitbits. The minute Apple Watch Series 6 becomes available, I’m buying it. I need some reliability. Bye, Fitbit!",2
0,I really don't even want to give this watch any stars. Bought this in January of 2020 and it now has a very dim screen and is locked to any scrolling. This watch costs a lot of money for only lasting not even a year and half. I have never abused this watch and gave it no reason to just stop working. From what I have read fitbit has horrible customer service and its a couple months past the warranty so guess it will just hit the junk drawer.. Fitbit will never get any of money again,1
1,"I would give this a 3.5 if I could. I imagine it would be closer to a 4.5 for the average user though... But as I was mostly in it for the sleep recording features and ideal wake up alarm. The alarm is really only effective if its tracking your sleep, which has been hit or miss for me. I have a low resting heart rate so it thinks I'm sleeping at very low rems most of the day and has a hard time tracking when I'm actually sleep. You can't manually start and stop it. You can add it after the fact but it won't have the in depth details, and I don't feel the regular sleep tracker is too accurate for previously stated reasons.",4
0,"I reached out to FITBIT because my battery is not maintaining a charge. My previous watch with them lasted 4 yrs. This one started having issue just past the 1 yr mark. They refuse to replace even though they state in their communication with me ""All our devices are made to last several years"" I've been a loyal customer since 2015. Very disappointed in this outcome. Will not buy again, and will spread the word on social media.",1
0,I tried every suggestion I could find to set this up to receive messages from my android phone. Nothing worked. I previously had an ionic watch that worked great for a long time but suddenly stopped receiving messages. I assumed it was defective so I bought the versa 2 . No luck. Apparently fitbit is having issues . I would stay away from fitbit.,1
0,"The Fitbit offers a lot of great features but the button on the side broke in only 9 months. The warranty process with Fitbit is horrible. You have to send it in via snail mail and they will not send a replacement until it arrives. I’ve been waiting for more than a week and they tell me that my Fitbit won’t arrive at their warehouse until 14 days after I sent it. Then they have to process it. So I’ll be without my watch for about a month which is not acceptable since their product was defective. I guess if you don’t have the watch for a month, it can’t break again.",2
1,"I like the look and feel of the Versa 2. Before I got this I had a Charge 2. I loved the charge 2. I had it for 2 years and wore it every day. My work has a health insensitive, but I liked that it would vibrate when I had a phone call. This kept me from missing calls when I was in the loud plant. I got the Versa as an upgrade and I like the features but absolutely hate how hard it is to pair with my phone. If I turn off my bluetooth by accident it will from then on reject the connection. I have to go to my settings and remove the device in the phone and the app. Twice I have had to uninstall and reinstall Fitbit. It's a royal pain. I don't know why this one is so much harder than the Charge 2, but it is. So far this is my only problem, but it's a big pain for me given I track steps for work.",3
1,"I got this mostly for use at work were the vibration of my phone can be drowned out buy the noise.Cons: screen doesn't always light up when I am I want it to and then often lights up when I didn't want it to. Small scratches appeared around the screen quite quickly. Can't read longer messages off of it. If you read messages on the watch they disappear from the the notifications tab on phone so I often forget to reply to people. You can take quite a few steps just lacing up some boots and even playing games sometimes. My wife is always complaining about the watch band scratching her when I'm wearing it.Pros: Comfy to wear. decreases strain on my phones battery. If I exercised more would be a great aid for goal setting. Having a stopwatch and timer on the wrist is great. Battery is fantastic, if I charge it when I shower and shave it is usually fully charged.",5
1,"The media could not be loaded.
 I purchased it in February 2020Today is July 2021 and it literally fell apartJust pup up opened and I’m in disbeliefWarranty only one year so be aware before purchasingOtherwise it was working fineToo bad …",3
0,"I was excited about getting my first smartwatch, but I guess it's too smart for me. I spent about an hour on chat tonight trying to get music set up. Then my watch said to connect to my phone via Bluetooth (which I had already set up), so I went into my phone and looked at the Bluetooth settings; the Versa 2 was there. So I thought I'd delete it and re-setup. Bad mistake. I went into the app and told it to set up the Versa 2, and deleted the old one. Now, in the setup, I told it to search for a Versa 2. I'm now on my 6th or 7th ""Try Again"" after it continually tells me that it can't find the Versa 2. (I know it's on because I'm using it to time how long this ordeal takes). I've turned both devices off and back on, result is the same.Net net is, this thing is difficult to set up and unreliable. Menus are not intuitive and it's hard to figure out how to do simple things. As much as I dislike Apple, at least I have to give them credit for making things simple. (I only gave them 2 stars because the watch does work...)",2
0,"Had this for a little over 3 months and the screen keeps freezing. Of course it started after I could not return it but at least there is a year warranty. I called customer support and they told me to restart it. An hour later it kept freezing again. Come to find out this is common among the versa watches. I'm going to call customer service again. This watch does not track your walking and running very well either if you are not using gps. After I walk a mile, it thinks I have only done .5 miles. I should have stuck with my garmin vivosmart HR plus. I had nothing bad to say about that watch.",2
0,"Mi FitBit Versa 2 lo compré en diciembre de 2019 y hasta la semana pasada estaba muy contento con mi reloj. Sin embargo, despues de una inmersion de buceo a 18 metros de profunidad dejó de funcionar. Al contactar al area de servicio al cliente la respuesta fue ""lo sentimos el reloj ya cumplió su garantia"". Mi disgusto es que el reloj NO CUMPLE con lo enunciado, era la primera vez que lo usaba para bucear y en mi primera inmersión se daña. Creo que es un engaño del fabricante que diga que resiste hasta 50 metros de profundidad cuando no es así. No todas las personas que compran pueden probar esta opción dentro del termino de garantía, y debería estar disponible por toda la vida util. Obviamente perdí la plata!",2
0,This is the 2nd attempt to make Fitbit devices work. 1st attempt resulted in return for replacement. This device is the replacement. Some Apps within Fitbit App do not work and in fact the “Sleep Icon” and data didn’t show up on several devices(4) didn’t appear even after the attempt to “uninstall & reset.” All permissions & notifications were selected as “on”; still no results. Previous experience with Fitbit Charge2 device worked very well for 3 years. I just don’t know what more I can do to make this Versa device work. Please give me some positive direction.Thanks.Bob,1
1,"Terrible job of counting paces, calories, distance. I tested it three days in a row for the exact time and speed on an elliptical cross trainer. Each day's data was off a lot, varying for 20% to 50%. I used a Polar chest strap for comparison. Only one day was near accurate. Returned this and ordered an Apple iPhone SE. A world of difference!",3
0,"Every time I try and use Alexa it doesn’t work. I have to open my fitbit app every time and make sure it’s connected, to even use Alexa. So basically I don’t use it because it’s a hassle going to the app every time I want to use Alexa. Second thing is since I’ve bought the watch I have an alarm at 10:30pm every night that will not go off. Under my alarms I have one alarm for me to wake up every day for work at 6am. I have reset the watch and checked the app for any additional alarms and there is nothing anywhere to be found. Also when I first purchased the watch it came with 2 bands and I used just the one for a couple of months and now that I wanted to change it up, I struggled trying to put the bands on just to realize that when it was made they made the straps backwards and they do not fit on the watch so I have bands that do not work. Very disappointed as I thought this would be an upgrade from my fitbit ionic. I love the fresh clear screen and the normal features fitbit offers but as far as Alexa and this dang alarm going off every day I’m pretty disappointed overall in the watch. Now I see that others may have problems swimming with the watch and that may just be a problem. I will have to see for myself and update my review when I go for a swim.",2
1,"Connection to spotify is terrible. Will connect the first time, but prolonged disuse of spotify or the watch means you either have to remove the watch's connection to your phone and set it up every time you want to use spotify, or reset your phone, and even with that the connection is horrid. It's always claiming your bluetooth is either off or there is no internet connection. As to battery, I haven't used it for two days and its lost 30%, so it wont last the 6 days it claims. It doesn't track steps well, I got like 50 steps while I was sitting down trying to link the band. When it actually does work, though, it makes for an alright watch.",3
1,"I debated with myself and sought the advice of others before purchasing this device. That being said, it is only okay. I did have to call tech support to get help syncing it to my phone, so it isn't the most user-friendly in that regard (I am a decently tech-savvy 32-year old). When I did get someone on the phone, he was SUPER condescending and not very helpful; he said the usual uninstall and re-install garbage, that I had already tried several times at that point. I switched techs and the next one was better.My biggest issue with this device is it is practically useless without the premium membership. Without the premium membership, you cannot use Alexa, Pandora, and most of the other apps. Buyer beware! So without that premium package, you paid for a smart watch, that becomes just a fancy fitness tracker that you could have just paid $100 for a good one.",3
1,"I really like the features, but I prefer the slim style of the Charge. I wear it every day and have enjoyed the music app options and using the voice feature with the Alexa app. The Bluetooth connection to a headset is great since I don't have to carry my phone around to listen to music while I work. I don't need or want all the functions of an Apple Watch so this is perfect for my needs. Also it's quite a bit more affordable.",5
0,"I have owned many fitbit devices but this is the first versa and I am super disappointed. I received this versa and it worked great for a couple weeks and then all of a sudden I stopped receiving certain notifications. I contacted Fitbit and although others were having the same problem, Fitbit didnt seem to concerned to fix this issue. It's not worth it to pay 200 for a product that is not going to to work as it says it's supposed to. Since Fitbit doesnt want to fix the issue I sent it back and purchased a galaxy watch and never looked back. Fitbit needs to work on making sure thier products work before releasing them.",2
1,I'm going to be returning this item bought it for a Christmas gift and you can't receive your messages or call or do anything going to have to return it for the Apple watch for a different watch should have read more up on this it's just Alexa not really up to date on technology yet it is the one company based like Amazon limited to do things on the watch,3
0,The only reason I upgraded to the versa 2 was so I could download my playlists and walk without my phone. Will not connect to computer to do this!!!! so Frustrated!! I have spent at least 2 hours online with Fitbit help and even purchased a wired mouse because it says you have to disconnect your bluetooth off your computer for it to work! LIES!! The last help session I had with fitbit he ended the chat session abruptly because he wasn't fixing the problem at all!! I don't even know what to do at this point except for return it!,1
0,"I really do enjoy the Fitbit products. This is my 3rd Fitbit (1st Versa), I don't use all the ""bells and whistles"" I just like to keep track of my steps, heart rate is helpful to know and I like the sleep score feature. It's been a little over a year and my watch has crapped out. It does NOT hold the charge for longer than 8 hours. I've tried all the recommended fixes and nothing works. I bought the extended warranty and will repost how that process went. Very disappointed.",2
0,"I bought this product to help me with my training and it has not been very helpful. It over calculates steps and calories burned. It says I took over 200 steps in my sleep and says I burned almost 2000 calories on day with no exercise. I am a 38 year old female, 5'7 in height and weigh 139 lbs; my minimum calories burned just living is 1430 calories per day. There is no way I am burning 2000 without some serious working out. I contacted Fitbit Customer Service and the issue could not be resolved. While researching how to try to fix this I came across a study from 2017 that said Fitbits have a 27% margin of error. This device was not useful at all in helping me with my fitness goals and I will be returning it.",2
1,"The watch simply does not keep correct step count and I have followed all of the manufactures instruction several times to reset, reboot, clear cache, even spent time on phone. Nice guy but I don't think he really knew much more than to read directions he had been given in a script. I write reviews on a lot of products and hate giving bad or ok reviews. But I am disappointed in the app and or watch technology. It would really be cool if my step and sleep recorded correctly and I could decide if paying $79 a year for the premium version of app was worth the cost. With so much technology and many apps availible it seems some app makers with a higher price product could spend a little profit to please customers. If this remains the same with fitbit it will be a trend with something newer and better taking its place for the same or less money. JMO.",3
0,This is the 2nd Fitbit which I purchased that lasted less than 6 months. I love the features of the product - it did what I needed it to do. But I can't afford to buy 2 or more Fitbits per year. The first Fitbit - the display stopped working. This 2nd Fitbit - the face just fell off. Therefore I will not be purchasing a Fitbit again.I just purchased a Garmin and this I can wear while I do my pool exercises which is basically just walking in the pool and a few other exercises. I guess I will see if I can get at least 1 year out of a Garmin product.,1
0,"Purchased this to track workouts and much like some reviews my heart rate stopped working. Tried all the trouble shooting, even factory reset and nothing. It was working at 1st then approximately 3 weeks in it stopped working. All settings have it on the ON position but its still not working, the green light on the sensor stopped flashing. I figure fitness was the reason for the fitbit and that one feature is a big reason why I purchased it. So I'm disappointed in my purchase.",2
0,"-The Amazon website description does not state the Requirement that the Fitbit Versa 2 Smartwatch App MUST be downloaded to a phone only.-I purchased this product as a Sweet 16 gift and when she opened it and attempted to download the app to her laptop it did not work.

Apparently many trackers do not download their Apps to a pc/laptop.",1
1,I love this! I upgraded my Fitbit flex for this one so I had a screen to look at. The battery life is great. It sends reminders to get up and move. Fits very comfortable. It is a bigger watch so I don’t sleep in it that just isn’t comfortable to me but I know people love it for sleep monitoring. Stylish too for a fitness watch. Overall happy,5
1,"Bought to replace my outdated Fitbit Alta HR. This model is so much better. I love the color screen and the fact that I can choose ""always on display"" feature and see the time constantly like a regular watch. That drove me nuts about the Alta HR. Easy to use and measures what I need it to. You can choose different styles of clock/stats through the app. It seems very accurate. Easy to read screen large enough for my 47yr old eyes. User friendly.",5
0,"Stopped sync after only a month and half. Contacted Fitbit, performed factory reset twice but didn't solve the problem. On positive side, Fitbit is giving me a replacement because it's still under warranty. I would give 4 star for Fitbit service, but 2 star for the product. It needs charging every 3 to 4 days, charger design prevents using a protective cover on the watch that would guard all the sides. Thus, cover must be removed every time you want to charge the watch.",2
1,"Im glad I got this fit bit. Im an avid walker and hiker and this gives me a push to walk further. I havent owned a scale in 20 years but bought the fit bit scale and like how it automatically logs my weight for me. The sleep tracker doesn't seem to be too accurate as there are night I've been awake for hours but it doesn't track that which is fine since that isn't a feature I care too much about. I like that it tracks water intake, when you get your period/fertility and heart rate.",5
1,I bought this Versa 2 back in January to replace my original Versa which was having battery trouble. When I bought the Versa 2 I was hoping that would change. The battery has never lasted the 4-5 days that some of the reviews said it would. At most it last 48-72 hours. Now I'm lucky if it lasts 24-36 hours. Other than that I love the watch. It works perfectly for what I use it for.,4
0,"This Fitbit versa 2 does not track sleep properly. I worked for the first few weeks then it would stop working. It is now past the time to return to Amazon.

It cost $150.Total waste of money. Do not buy one!",1

0,Nothing but problems from day one. It has completely expired already!! You have to pay a yearly membership fee to use it too! You can never reach a service representative because the enthusiasm is about selling not about support. They are good at referring you to other members. I'll have to check to see what other brands Humana supports.,1
1,Great fitness watch. Very accurate. I did notice that it did not track anything well in a hospital setting. My husband spent several days in the hospital connected to various equipment and the equipment interfered with the tracking of steps. Steps were not recorded when in range of any hospital equipment.Sometimes the mobile app could not locate the Fitbit even though they were within reach of each other. Sometimes I have to charge the watch I order for the mobile app to locate it or reboot my iPhone. I am quite please with the Fitbit Versa 2. I love the reminders letting you know you haven’t moved in an hour. I find myself moving constantly now due to the fitbit,5
1,"The Versa 2 has several features besides just tracking steps. It great for monitoring sleep/resting heart rate/breathing fluctuations. It has alarm features so that you can use it as an appointment reminder. The watch face is easy to read and is easy to scroll through various features. I use is when biking to track distance traveled and there is no need for a separate odometer on my bike. A plus, too, is the ""find my phone"" feature. If i misplace my phone somewhere in the house I simply press the icon on my Fitbit and my phone beeps. I recommend this version of Fitbit Versa.",4
0,"So, I bought it for the Spotify control and so I could look at texts at work, without pulling out my phone. It worked great for the most part but the Spotify connection was tedious and had to be reconnected every use, after a while I had reset the watch to get the voice to text feature to reconnect and work properly. I only had this watch for 5 months before it malfunctioned again and when I reset it, I didn't realize til later, didn't sync to my phone. I tried everything to get it to pair again and it wasn't even registering on Bluetooth. It was running 15 minutes fast, that I couldn't fix because I couldn't get it to pair. Said my pulse was 192 when I was standing still. I reset my phone, I reset the watch, I reinstalled the app to make sure it had all the updates. Nothing. I'm glad I didn't pay full price for this but I'm still mad I wasted $130 on a watch to only last me 5 months...",1
1,"It's a love/hate relationship.. I love the watches new features. Coming from the charge 2, it was a big upgrade. But there are more negitives, than positives for me.. I can't wear it on my right wrist because of my small tattoo. It can't read your heart rate through I tattoo. My Charge 2 could read though the tattoo. So I'm not sure of the issue. Lots of errors with transferring data between the watch and the phone. Refreshing screen works to correct that sometimes. I wish some features worked without needing the phone nearby. Battery life has significantly reduced since purchasing. Kinda wishing I would have gone with a Samsung. Looking for a new watching already.",3
0,"I've worn Fitbit devices (Charge, Charge 2 - currently the Versa 2) since 2013. Previous Fitbit products were terrific. They worked as advertised and I never had a problem. The screen of my Charge 2 cracked after years of wear so I decided to upgrade to the Versa 2 in January. It was great until March when the battery began dropping from 100% charge to under 70% within a few hours -- and that's after I performed the recommended reset, turned off nearly all functions to test and preserve battery life. At this point, I'm really not using it in any useful way - it's just a large black box strapped to my wrist.So I decide I've tried everything I can on my own and attempt to contact the company. Their Live Chat function fails over and over again over the course of two days. I finally call the customer service line and get a very bored sounding rep who gets irate with me after I tell her that the Live Chats that are logged all failed to stay connected and she gives me a lecture about ""I have a procedure to follow"" and I'm told I have to perform a battery test over the course of a day before I can proceed to whatever the next step is (she didn't say and I'm too annoyed to ask at this point).If I go forward and do the test and the customer service to resolve the problem improves, I'll certainly consider adjusting my review and rating because that's only fair, but as it stands right now I regret buying the Versa 2 and would be very unlikely to buy from Fitbit again.",2
1,"So far, the Versa 2 is the only pedometer I've used that's accurate. I like the ability to change the watch face. There are quite a few available and more are added every day. The apps available are hit and miss. Some are really cool, while others are a waste of space. My Garmin, which was $50, offered sleep tracking and app notifications, too. It was a great watch! I'm sure when I take the time to add my music to the app, I'll like the watch more. Right now, it's more of a really pretty, very expensive pedometer. My battery lasts about 2 days but usually recharges less than an hour.",4
0,the 1st few days i was very happy with it though the calander didnt work no matter how many times i tried with support. but once the update came thru it all went to crap. alexa quit working and so did voice replies. it stopped syncing. support had me do a factory reset and that didnt even work. it said couldnt reset and froze the screen. so i returned and got a new 1 and now im having it exact same problems starting up with the replacement. save ur money and go with a different company cause their support knows nothing and the product is crap.,1
0,"I was excited when I upgraded and ordered the Vera 2. I thought it would motivate me to get back in track but Instead it frustrated me.The first Versa 2 I bought did not track sleep and the HR monitor was all over the place. I followed directions and reset it multiples times with no luck. I also did a factory reset. Again, no luck.I got the replacement and the HR was tracking but it would still not track sleep. I did the reset and took a nap during the afternoon to test it out. It still did not track. I am returning and turning Tom my trusty Charge 2.",1
0,"The watch worked great...for 3 months. Then it stopped charging. I contactedfitbit support. They won't offer a replacement even though its been undera year. All they offered was a 35% discount on another purchase, which Ihave 30 days to use (which probably means 3 days in Fitbit time).",1
0,I wish I could say more about the product but I can't. I ordered the item today received it today and it was on time. The sad part is my Android Cell phone is not completable with the Fitbit. My phone is not listed of the phones the Fitbit is compatible with. I like the way the watch looks it and the style but it does me no good if it does not sync with my phone. If it states it is completable with Android phone then it should apply to all the phones that Android has and just pick which once Fitbit want to make compatible. It really sucks. Tomorrow I'm returning the phone that I was excited to get and can't use.,1
1,"On my 2nd Versa because I thought the 1st one was defective. Nope - that's just how it works. Steps inaccurate - I can get 6 steps w/o leaving the bed: the watch is very generous with the steps. Sleep tracker - sometimes the recording (REMS, light sleep, deep sleep) works, sometimes it doesn't. I found it very difficult to set up the connection to Alexa but that could be the user problem (66 yr old). Rotating wrist to light the watch face is touchy - again sometimes it works, sometimes not. I got the watch for the heart rate because I had a heart attack in Dec. That is the one thing that does work consistently for which I am thankful... and the clock works. I haven't tried the other apps. I had high hopes but probably would not have bought this watch with my current experience.",3
1,"I have the versa 1 and i had gotten this hoping for a good upgrade with the Alexa. While this does bring in a MUCH NICER display, this still is not worthy for me to get since the one reason I was looking forward to this upgrade was Alexa and that is spotty at best. I’m super happy with my first gen versa and while this has some nice improvements, it’s not a reason enough for an upgrade for me. If you, however do not have version 1, I would highly recommend getting this over any other watch. My wife uses an Apple Watch, and I would get this over that any day.",4
1,"So I'll start by saying i got this watch to help me track workouts better as this was the main claim. My narrowed focus was on my heart rate, which I like to train in a ""zone"" of 80-90% max. This watch never tracked me higher than 160, which when I connected to an actual HR monitor was more around 180. I understand there are limitations and everything else this watch did it does it well, sleep tracking, running, swimming it does it all. So while not my favorite for tracking heart rates while working out it does a decent job on everything else.",3
0,"There is a lot to like about this device, but one stupid show stopper. Unlike all of the other smartwatches I have tried, including the $40 VIRMEE 3 Plus, this device will not send real-time heart rate to third-party applications such as Strava and MapmyRun. A quick check of the Fitbit discussion boards shows that this has been requested for many years, with Fitbit ignoring the requests. This would be an extremely easy addition, and it boggles the mind that something this expensive cannot do something so basic. My suggestion would be to purchase another watch unless and until Fitbit gets its act together. I've returned the device and will not consider any more Fitbit devices.",1
0,"The entire face and screen of this watch just randomly popped out. Watch has never been exposed to water, heat, cold, or any damage. No signs of wear on the watch other than the screen just randomly popping off out of nowhere one day while wearing it. Upon inspection, it looks as if the manufacturers adhesive has failed. Very disappointed as I have loved this product up until now.",1
1,I love Fitbit. I rocked the Alta before this one and the Charge HR before that.I was hoping for a Fitbit that would emphasize a little bit more of the internet... that’s why I bought it. It says it’s a smart watch with Alexa (which I thought would be great... since I have echo dots all over the house and one in the car).Soooo this watch is nothing more than a glorified Alta or Charge. They also alert you to phone notifications (like this Versa does) but without the ability to respond. There is no keyboard. I’m disappointed.,3
1,"I purchased this watch less than a year ago. It was working well until recently. My guess is the latest update pushed to the device is the culprit. Suddenly the watch won't stay connected to GPS. The distance and pace on the exact same routes taken for months are now drastically shorter and slower. Fitbit seems to have no answers as there are many inquiries on the forums. If this issue wasn't happening, I'd give it 4 stars as I thought it was a good value as far as performance for the cost. But, as of now I am extremely disappointed in Fitbit. Sounds like many people are going to switch to other brands. It is sad, as I've had a fitbit device for a long time and was a loyal customer. But, if they don't fix this soon, I am switching.UPDATE: I am changing my review from 2 to 3 stars, for now. The fitbit community forum had a solution to the GPS issue. It is not perfect, but it is better. I find it ridiculous that Fitbit did not have an answer for this, and instead the community had to figure it out themselves.",3
0,A disappointment. As a satisfied long time Blaze owner I traded up to a Versa 2 when the button on my Blaze fell off (spring and all popped out). I wore out several bands but had no issues otherwise. My reason for wearing a Fitbit device is exercise related especially to monitor heart rate/bpm since I have heart disease and am on medication. My Versa 2 is all over the place with detecting bpm. While reading a book I looked at the bpm screen on the device and it was showing 170. (The book was not that exciting.) On several occasions during HIIT training sessions I checked and my bpm was 30 or 50 and I would check 30 second later and it was 137. For extended periods of time after exercise but doing absolutely nothing the bpm view was jumping from the mid 60's to the mid 90. I do perspire and secure the device high and tight as best is possible but still slides down my arm. I contacted Fitbit help and on both occasions the school solution was to reset the device. Failure on both occasions as the issue continues. I asked if it was possible if a sensor or whatever detected pulse could be defective - still waiting for a response. Since resting pulse and calories burned are bpm related I assume those are likely inaccurate. Parting shot - too many duplicate apps options. Not likely to purchase another Fitbit device. Will look for a fitness device not an Apple Watch wanna be.,2
0,"I've been a FitBit user since December, 2014, and have had few problems with their lesser gear, but my Versa 2 watch is useless for measuring exercise heart rate. I get readings as high as 203 bpm when actual is 118. Today it read 171 when actual bpm was 110. Chat help was unable to fix. I'm recovering from a heart attack and am in a medically-supervised cardiac rehabilitation program. To stay on this regimen, I need an accurate reading. Heart rate was checked with a Lovia Oximeter, which reads exactly the same as my MD's.",2
0,Piece of crap. Bought it on 1/2/22 and it quit working on 2/9/22. Miss the return window by a few days. Did everyting technical to get it to work. Lost my money. Done with FitBit.,1
0,I've spent years buying Fitbit products hoping to find one that would actually work properly. This one worked for a short while and then began not holding a charge. Went from charging every three days to charging overnight every night. Now I discovered the battery dead and I had charged it all night last night and yet it didn't make it through the day. Time to give up and go to the apple watch. So goodby Fitbit ... I really tried to make it work but it actually does take two to tango.,2
1,"Love this smart watch. I went from an old Apple Watch to this and don’t regret it. I gave it four stars instead of five only because the difficulty with getting your notifications can be a pain, also because when running indoors on the treadmill it doesn’t seem to track strides/distance properly. Other than that it’s been perfect! I really like the sleep reports and the around the clock heart rate tracking. The battery life is great! I can get 5 to 6 days out of my watch before charging again.",4
0,"The versa 2 does not seem to be very dependable. I just had to order a 3rd one (in a little over a year) because the second one (my replacement) just died. The only reason I ordered another Versa 2 is because I just purchased some bands that fit this model and those cannot be returned. It would be nice if these would be produced to have a universal band -- not model specific. I hope this new one last longer than a year. I can say, if this one dies just after warranty expires I will switch to a different name brand. I have been a fitbit wearer for many many years and it just seems that the last 4 or 5 of them lasted just over a year - so it is not covered under warranty. This is getting too expensive to replace every 13 months.",1
1,"I've had my Versa 2 for 11 months and while I love it, a few weeks back the face up and popped off. I didn't bump into anything so it must have been wear and tear from all the vibrating. It seemed like an easy enough fix to super-glue it back on but that only works for a couple days before it pops off again. The display was still working despite it being slightly detached but not for long. As of now it's showing a fuzzy bright screen and no way to turn it off so the battery drains very quickly...I'm eager to buy another so I don't skip my tracking but on principle I can't buy another given this Versa 2 was my 5th fitbit in 4 years. (that is a testament to both how loyal I am to fitbit but also to note I've never requested a replacement before and not willing to spend another $170 due to a factory defect)",4
1,"I bought this to replace the versa 1 I broke. Was pretty excited to get it and the price point was spot on. It's a great update, with subtle changes. Fitbit really knows how to do it for someone that doesn't want bells and whistles, but good workout tracking with functions for a normal fairly active adult. Cannot imagine buying any other brand of smart watch.",5
1,"Watch is nice the only problem is the horrible Bluetooth connection issue. Reading up on it I see that this is an issue many people have. Wish I knew this before I bought it. I'm a Samsung user and my first smart watch was a Samsung and it was great but it broke so I decided to try a fitbit. Nice color, decent features but the Bluetooth connection is trash. For reference I have a Samsung galaxy z flip and a galaxy tab and none stays connected",3
1,"I like the watch. I purchased a different band. It looks so much better with the new band. I already scratched the front and I am very easy on my things. The sleep app is cool, but you have to use your phone to analyze the data. I really like tracking my steps. It alerts you to text messages and incoming calls which is nice, but you can’t actually answer the call or reply which would be extra nice. Haven’t found any great apps. I don’t really like any watch faces except for the original. Other than that it’s a great watch. Glad I purchased mine on sale.",4
0,"If you are a runner, don't get this watch. It looks great, but the functionality sucks. There is no built in GPS and it does not connect to the Strava app. The fitbit app has an awful interface. I tried getting support and they just told me it doesn't work, it's not their fault and they don't know when it will start working properly again. So basically I have an expensive sleek looking watch that tells me the time and tracks my steps etc., but is useless for workouts.",2
1,"A great upgrade on the original. If you want a smartwatch thats more of a fitness tracker this is it. Comfortable, great apps and features, lots of storage for music, and a good value for cost. If you want more of a smartwatch than a fitness tracker, look elsewhere. Great battery life, easy to use out of the box. The only drawback is the charger, which doesnt sit flat on a surface. Get a third party charger and save some headaches.",5
1,"This watch is worth the money. It has amazing battery life. I take it off about every three days to charge for about thirty minutes and then it is good to go. It tracks sleep and shows you when you were awake, deep sleep, rem sleep. It tracks your steps, calories burned and so much more. The app is easy to use. I very much recommend this watch.",5
0,"This by far is the worst fit bit I've had. Since this last update, it won't work. Steps not all counted, dies not track full night sleep. Followed instructions from the app, nothing. I'm making payments on a piece of junk. Battery last a day maybe and a half now. And if course it's past the month window to send back. Would never recommend this junk drawer Fitbit to any one! Save your money!",1
1,I would have given this 5 stars except that the band ripped after my husband wore if for a couple of days. He has a new band coming due to the warranty so I'm hoping this one works. He really likes being able to track his steps. This is his 1st Fitbit and since he started a new job where he is walking a lot he wanted to start tracking his steps. He is already addicted to it so it was disappointing to him & me when the band broke.,4
1,"I’ve been wanting this watch for quite sometime. I love everything about this watch. It’s user friendly, accurate, and comfortable. The mobile app is great. It’s easy to use and runs smoothly. I love the sleep tracking and being able to see that data in depth. I also love the customization within the app. My only complaint is with the charger itself. For some reason the cable comes out of the back of cradle and not from a side like the Versa charger does. It causes the watch to lay sideways while it’s charging instead of laying flat on a counter. It's a little inconvenient but a very minute detail that can be dealt with. Other than that, I love this watch and would recommend.",4
1,"I love the fitbit brand. The versa 2 covers all of the bases!I see my texts, can reply on the device too. It monitors heart rate, steps, activity and sleep. The app also let's you track your blood glucose levels now along with water, weight and food. The battery may last 6 days if you don't use all of the features but why get this unit if you're not going to use all of the features? I charge mine every 2 days while I'm in the shower and getting ready for my day.",5
0,"Lasted 6 month and stopped reading heart rate, got a replacement from warranty. That one lasted 4 months. Now I'm past the 1 year warranty (even though I got the replacement 4 months ago) so fitbit won't do anything about it. Terrible product, obviously had defective design. Don't waste your money. Get a different brand. I've wasted more time with customer service trying to fix my versa then actual enjoying it. The features never worked the way they should have. The notifications for text and calls would either not notify me at all or come through multiple times. The sleep tracker seemed to work ok but it would take a day to show up on the app. Definitely NOT worth the money!!",1
0,I bought this fitness tracker in March and just under 5 months later and it is broken. The time no longer displays and the screen freezes up. I am extremely disappointed as this watch is still pretty new and it’s already malfunctioning.,1
1,"This is the best watch ever. I have a Google pixel 2 XL phone and I love it. I couldn't find a compatable smart watch at all. But I didn't give up. Then I kept searching Amazon, and I found it. I work in an office so this is so nice I don't have to put my phone to see who is calling or texting. Just look at my watch. Even though I cannot answer the phone I can still reply to text message. The sleep tracking is amazing. Also my heart rate resting, walking or whatever I am doing. I can say enough about this watch and comes with chargers. I would highly recommend it.",5
1,"If you are like me and my husband and whip out a board game just so we can compete in SOMETHING and get to rub it in the other persons face for days, then get you AND your significant other a FitBit. We find ourselves competing on everything now, from who has the most steps, to who did the most workout, who has the best heartrate, to even who has the best sleep score.... the competitions are endless.",5
1,I originally had a Fitbit Alta for 6 years and it stopped charging. I ordered a different brand from another site and was not happy with it and sent it back. I decided to stick with Fitbit and ordered this Versa 2. I love it! Totally accurate with my steps and activity. Easy to set and use. I also like the larger size (from my Alta). I wasn't sure I would but totally love it!,5
1,"This is my second Versa 2 that took a dive on me. I just purchased the latest one 2 months ago. After about a month, the notifications for calls stopped. Now out of nowhere, without warning it stopped working. Screen is black unless I hold the button in then the timer comes on but nothing else happens. This is so frustrating. I think I’m going to purchase an Apple Watch next. Not impressed with Fitbits.",5
1,"Absolutely love my versa 2 Fitbit!!! I use it for time, heart rate, steps!!! I’ve programmed it to my iPhone Fitbit apt and love the instant input with blue tooth. This watch lets me see who is texting me instantly. There are many other things that it is capable of doing but I haven’t set those up yet. I have the versa and when it died I just had to get a new one and versa 2 was my choice. The price was fair from my research, arrived quickly and looks exactly as was advertised!!",5
1,"Disappointed. I ordered this because it says it had Spotify controls, microphone to reply to messages and use Alexa, etc. Microphone does not work at all. Music controls only work if you have Spotify or Pandora Premium so cant use with the free version. So pretty much I paid $200 to see my texts on my wrist and count my steps. What a waste.",3
0,"Purchased this in late November after wearing Charge for a couple of years with NO PROBLEMS-ever! Wanted to upgrade for Alexa, music and weather! It will not stay connected to WiFi! Got the above items connected! All three worked for about 5 hours and have not been able to get them connected! Continually tells me I am not connected to WiFI! It will not sync! Have folllowed instructions to no avail! I am going to return! I would not recommend this model!",1
1,"The watch itself is fine. Give us a better app to pair with the watch and the rating would be higher. Battery life is good but the screen is not on all of the time. Watch screen is crisp and easy to read which is a plus. This was the reason I chose this watch over another Garmin. The problem stems from the app where you must pay a high monthly fee to obtain all of the benefits from the watch . If you are rich and have disposable income to spare on monthly app fees this might work. I'll probably go back to Garmen. The Garmen does several things better.... Better pulse accuracy, better on watch messaging replies and a better app. For me this could have been a good trade off if I didn't have to spend more money to use all of the benefits.",3
0,"It's a nice WATCH, keeps time, can get text and calls ect from it. As a fitness watch its a joke. I can sit on my butt all day and hit 10,000 steps. I was out riding in my UTV it told me I was bike riding. The app spams me with all kinds of messages about badges I am earning for laying in bed or on the couch. When I was out on a walk or at work I rack up steps like I am a marathon runner. I borrowed a Garmin watch which I feel was much closer to what I really was doing in a day the two were not remotely close. If I were to make a purchase again I would Go with a Garmin or an Apple. They may cost a bit more but I bought this for accuracy which I am not getting. Garmin and Apple make fitbit like a dollar store buy.",2
1,"Sleep tracking is not as good as my original versa. I get detailed sleep results 40-60 percent of the time. Should be 90 percent. Disappointing. Reported the issue many times straight to Fitbit. They want to Pin it on the user. As a long time user of Fitbit, this is not so, either my Fitbit is defective or the software needs tweaking. Annoying. Aside from the sleep tracking, which is very important to me, everything else is great. I love it with the exception of the failed sleep tracking.",3
0,The watch worked great until the infamous “Black Screen” appeared this morning. Research it for yourself but the screen went black and nothing worked to reset it.,2
0,"Bait and switch on the battery life. The box clearly states it only has a 4+ day battery life. I didnt even open the box based on this information. The watch is advertised as having a 6+ day battery life. Neither Fitbit nor Amazon were any help on this when I contacted both companies. Sending it back, but attaching a pic to save everyone else frustration. If the battery life is important do not rely on the advertisement.",1
0,"The picture is of the 2nd Fitbit sent to me because the face came unglued. I bought the original in Sept 2019 the face fell off in June 2020. And now the face fell off on the replacement in May 2021. This is a poor design flaw. To pay $200 for a piece of equipment that barely makes it a year and they won't replace it. Oh, they sent me a 35% off coupon to buy another piece of their junk. I am livid!!!!",1
1,"I regret not buying this sooner. While the battery doesn't last up to 5 days, more like 2-3, that's my only complaint. I absolutely love this Fitbit. It knows when your on a cardio machine and automatically tracks it for you, can go in water (won't take that chance), tracks my heart rate and steps. I bet there's a bunch more I'll learn on the way. I'm so glad I invested in my fitness with this watch.",5
0,"I have owned 3 versa fit bits, the first one fit bit lite died after wearing it in a hot shower had it 8 months. The replacement lasted about the same the face came off and just hung there wouldn't stay closed. I bought a fit bit 2 6 months ago and again the face just came open and does not close . I am in contact with customer service to see what the will do . I expect a watch to last a few years not a few months very discouraging. I don't know if some of the features work like alexa or pay or music haven't used them tried alexa but couldn't get it to work. The steps count didn't match the steps on any walk videos I have used it's always under by about 500 steps a mile. Think twice before buying this!!",2
1,"Who doesn’t love Fitbit!? Bought this as a Christmas gift. It’s perfect just as you might expect. This is a nice starter watch in my opinion. I wasn’t sure if he would be committed enough to wear it 24/7 (that’s the only way you get the most out of your Fitbit and get the best health insights). This is a couple steps down from the fancy and newer models, but still has all the pizazz of a Fitbit and a smartwatch. Highly recommend!",5
0,"After a years use I come to the conclusion this is a second rate watch. There is no accuracy to the steps and you will find that you may reach your steps goal sitting on the couch having a conversation and moving your arms a bit. Additionally, as I travel it has becomes difficult to reset the time when it should just update when you sync your phone and watch. Would not buy again.",2
1,Bought this as a gift for my husband who has been using the charge 4. Having high blood pressure it's important that he has a little extra help monitoring it. This watch has been fantastic. It has a nice and easy touch screen. It is easy to read and it has so many options hes almost overwhelmed. I'm glad I made the decision to buy it!,5
1,"This is my 3rd fitbit device over the last 4 years so very familiar with app and set up process. However the app was updated on 10/13/20 which added bugs and has prevented full set-up of device.Also concerned this was a returned product as evidence by taped package, and watch partially put together and packaged upside.At this point can't tell if the device the problem or if it is the app.On the positive, I like the weight of the watch and fit.",3
0,"I have been unable to get my Fitbit Versa 2 to pair with my Samsung Galaxy S20. I have seen reviews, complaints, comments on the Fitbit support site and elsewhere saying others are unable to pair their Fitbit Versa2 with the Samsung S20. I have tried different suggestions of changing s20 phone settings but no success....my old Samsung phone did not have a recent enough OS version and could not be updated to the necessary OS so I had to buy a new phone which is the Samsung S20 I now have. Unfortunately The time between My purchase through Amazon for the Fitbit Versa2 and my purchase of the samsung s20 from Walmart (which replaced my galaxy grand prime) and identifying I could not pair the samsung s20 with my fitbit was beyond the time specified by Amazon for returning my Fitbit product to Amazon. IS THERE ANY WAY I CAN RETURN MY VERSA2 TO AMAZON AND RECIEVE A REFUND?????",1
0,"WARNING: If you have an android and want any fitbit watch STAY AWAY! Tech support just confirmed with me that they are unable to support any current android devices at this time...what a waste! You would think they can fix something like this quickly, but it has been happening for weeks. They also list supported devices which includes android, not the case...Fitbit needs to come out and clearly say what their doing to repair the issues with Android. Started my return today!!",1
1,I own Versa 2 as well as the Advanced Sense Fitbits. Most of the useful features are present in both the devices even though the latter costs almost a 100 bucks more.Definitely a good value for the money!,4
0,"My wife likes square watches, and because we don't use apple products this is the only option available to be used with Android. The watch looks great, nice feel and weight to it, but it lacks features that competitors have, namely the ability to actually respond to text messages. While it is possible to respond to texts you are limited to 3 pre-set messages or a voice response which doesn't actually pick up what you are saying even when you dictate as clearly as possible. Sadly this was the present I bought for my wife for Christmas and now it will be returned.",2
1,I’ve had the Fitbit charge 2 in the past. It was great but the band was not my favorite. I have been looking at this Fitbit (Versa 2) and the Apple Watch. I didn’t care for many of the features that the Apple Watch offered and I know I wasn’t going to use many of them so choosing the versa 2 was definitely the right choice. I like to track my sleep and I like it’s simple design and functionality compared to the Apple Watch. Setup took a bit long but once I got it working; it was all smooth sailing. I am so happy with my purchase!,5
1,"I am very happy with this purchase. The one thing Apple watch has is the ability to use watch to make calls. For the price, I can still control my ITunes playlist, battery life much much better than AW 9 i almost forgot to charge it, but I like the notifications as reminders), and its waterproof. The more affordable price makes me less anxious about wearing the watch with concerns on damage or losing it.",5
1,A huge improvement over the Charge (which I had for several years). I love this thing. It is so versatile and easy to navigate. It is bigger and clunky looking but that is ok as I can see it well. Really haven't explored all that it can do but getting there. Great tracker for my sporting and fitness activities. Love the colors on the screen! It has actually been mistaken for an Apple Watch! (Not that I mind). So glad I chose this over the new Charge.,5
0,"Please don't buy this product. After 3 years, my beloved Fibit died. So I got a replacement.So I'm literally watching my fitbit sit on top of my phone and not update. Woot!-It updated then refused to update further. Just locked up and died.-Customer support was atrocious. Their answer was to buy a new phone (really). When I said I was using a computer, the answer was still, but a new phone (really). So it only works with their phone of the day.",1

This was less than two months ago.This time around, however, my versa has been acting up, touchscreen works occasionally, as does the button on the side. Calls and texts usually come through, but there is no way to answer since the touchscreen doesn’t work.Very disappointed in this Fitbit.",1
0,"The Fitbit worked great for a month or two and then it crapped out. Now it's basically just a watch. It's sporadic on whether it will monitor your sleep or not, same with the heart rate. I've worn it every which way on my wrist to get it to work, and reinstalled the program even did an update. The notifications you've already cleared or answered pop up over and over again from days previous. I would not buy this again, or recommend it.",2
0,this product is so crappy they even advise you that you might not be able to use the extra band they provided let alone any other bands. There instructs for activating it are really bad and it does not work nearly as well as the charge model. When they updated it a few weeks ago the GPS bike ride tracking feature now only tracks the first 2 blocks of my 3-8 mile bike rides. The stair feature now says i do lots of stairs and i live in a house without stairs and when i am in a house with stairs it now says i do 3 times as many stairs. everytime i open the app on my phone it's displays wrong information and or takes forever to sync with my LG G7 thin. would strongly recommend you don't waste your money on this piece of junk....,1
0,"The app is very glitchy. Takes forever to synchronize if it does, most times it does not! It just crashes!The Alexa function...NEVER works! Since it has problems working with my phone, and it needs the phone to function. It has not worked once! I have tried to fix this! But if I have to get my phone every time to fix connectivity to the watch, it is easier to open the Alexa app and finish what I needed without using the watch.The app needs a lot of work!!I am not sure how accurate the watch is, for all other apps and monitoring it does, but without a good app, it does not work well!",2
1,I love the Fitbit Versa 2. I would have gone with the Versa 3 or Fitbit Sense but the reviews said that you had to sign up for premium service to get most of the functionality. Once I received my Fitbit Versa 2 I decided to try the premium service with a free trial. The value for the subscription is well worth the $9.99 a month or I will do the yearly for $79. 12 months! Fortunately the Versa 2 is able to use most of the functions as the higher priced versions. May upgrade someday but am completely happy with the Versa 2!,5
1,I really enjoyed the watch the first few months I had it. It did mostly what my old apple watch did and did it cheaper. I decided to take a swim a few days ago and now it won't turn on no matter what I do. I'm now back to Apple Watch since you can actually take those for a swim safer. Should really fix the water-resistance and not offer swim apps if they can't be used in the water for a light swim!,3
1,"This watch has a good Battery life but falls way short in accurately recording movement. For example today it has recorded over 1300 steps and I have truly only walked maybe 150. The watch is a nice size and fits my smaller wrist well. I was hoping to have better options for a clock face, but only the ones made by Fitbit are free and I didn't find many of them to be very appealing, plus the faces don't completely fill the screen. The heart rate appears to be fairly accurate, and I haven't used the sleep monitor yet. At this price point i think it should be able to do better.",3
1,"This was bought as a Valentine's Day replacement for my wife's Inspire 2 tracker, our entree into a fitness tracking devise. While Inspire 2 provided her with the basic tracking information, it's impossible to read in the bight daylight, and difficult to see because of the small size at anytime. The larger face and brightness controls make the Versa a much better tracker for anyone who have any difficulty reading.",4
1,"This Product delivers what it claims. A great pedometer, goal tracker, and companion to your phone. It has everything that the Fitbit line up has, minus the GPS. Compared with other trackers it does well to bring a comfortable watch and experience for a consumer. However where it falls below expectations is the GPS being absent from such a high price point when competitors can offer a premium watch experience as well on-board GPS. This is where I think that Fitbit places its limitations. When the consumer sets up the watch, its loaded with lots of software that likely most will not use or you already have access to on your phone. Customization is done through the Fitbit app, which coming back to after 4 years left this consumer with dissatisfaction. The app is bloated with tabs to thing other than your device's dashboard and its cross connectivity between Android phone and Fitbit app leaves a lot to be desired. This consumer is not interested in the premium features as there not a whole lot of things I could justify $70 year for meditations and guided exercises that I can get elsewhere.Bottom line: If you're looking for a fashionable entry level wearable that tracks sleep, steps, and occasional payments from your watch, then this might be for you.",3
0,I have been a long time Fitbit user but I’m done. Customer service used to be one of the best. I used this for 2 1/2 years with zero issues. Just installed an update a couple of days ago and immediately got this green screen and a glitchy screen. Customer service says it’s out of warranty so they will give me 35 percent off a new one. No thank you! I had zero issues before the update.,1
1,I have had Fitbit Versa for about 2 years and have really enjoyed it. It started to get a little 'glitchy' after I got it in some water for an extended period of time so I started researching the Versa 3. I read a lot of reviews and decided to go with the Versa 2 because of features and price. I'm SO happy with this purchase! It's a great watch and I love being able to track my exercise/my sleep and my heart rate. I got a great deal on Prime day and I'm very happy with my purchase!,5
1,"Love Versa2. The watch face is clear. Enjoy changing the clock faces, monitoring steps, heart rate, apps (weather, music), notifications, answering text through watch with Alexa and sleep. Love the progress report sent by email and how weight sincs with the app. The celebration when a goal is reached is motivatingUnfortunately, it does not want to sinc with my Samsung S10+5G when I want at times. Hoping that with the updates, it will be seamless. I have 3 Fitbit watches (Versa Lite and Versa2) /trackers (Inspire HR) which I alternate.",5
0,"The watch is junk. Sometimes the display activates automatically, but usually not. Often I end up pressing the button to get the watch to display. Often I just don't bother. No day/date. Doesn't do basic things, like plot heart rate over the course of a workout or over the course of a day. I get fitbit e-mail occasionally that makes it clear that data is leaking. They have my money; they don't need my data. The step counts are high. It comes with marginally useful bands.",2
1,Huh where do I even start? I had very high expectations for this watch based on the price turns out to be very poor. 1 the software on the watch and app in the phone are completely garbage.. 2. Very bad processing speed and connection speed (took an hour and half for just tracker update).. 3. The tracking is not very accurate and not real time you have to wait for a while to get the correct figures..I suggest y'all should expect a 4/10 from this watch and just get a better one at a higher price.,3

I bought my phone brand new Sept '19. The watch last christmas was $200 they have newer versions out much more expensive and you would think Newer phone new watch compatible, I mean why would you think otherwise? There are more apple products on the list of course but the fall short with Samsung.

Battery life is excellent.Con: Absolutely stinks at tracking distance (just google it and read the forums) compared to a garmin GPS it is off nearly 2 tenths per mile and not consistent, flaky staying connected to Samsung S9. Alexa will hear you the first week or so and then it will no longer hear you unless your mouth is basically on your wrist talking to the side of the tracker. I have returned mine after 5 weeks. Not ready for prime time.",2
1,"My old Fitbit was in desperate need of replacement. I researched some products and in the end, it came down to another Fitbit or an Apple watch. Ultimately, even though I’m a total Apple junkie, I could not justify spending hundreds of extra dollars. This is an excellent watch for a much more reasonable price.",5
0,It won't stay connected and to get it to connect it's alot of turning the product on and off forgetting and re adding the device. I've had it for 3 days and it stopped working for no reason then amazon lost my replacement item. YOU CAN NOT CONNECT TEXT OR CALL TO IT OR RESPOND LIKE IT CLAIMS ITS A LIE AND JOKE!!!! I was not able to get any notifications through it at all of any kind.,1
0,"By far the worst Fitbit version ever made. I was a big fan of Fitbit but this one is complete garbage. It never connected to gps even with the phone right next to the watch. Didn’t log workouts or there would be missing information. Sleep tracking was so inaccurate. It would say I would sleep a full night (8hrs) but in reality it would only be 5. Steps where inaccurate as well. Overall it was the worst Fitbit I have ever owned. Save your money, it’s a pretty looking smart watch but it’s completely worthless",1
1,"Ok let's start with this watch was fantastic... Until I checked the time 2 years after purchase. The watch is light and comfortable to wear. I'm not sure if Id recommend for people wanting a long term watch considering my screen popped out after 2 years of owning. The screen came out just checking the time, no big bumps or anything just flick of the wrist and screen broke the seal. Going to do a bit more homework before my next smart watch but did drop fitbit down a notch after 4 years with my original one before this. Probably a freak case but still something to consider when purchasing.",5
1,"It's beautiful and loaded with options. I paid a little more for the music options, this is where I get very disappointed and wished I'd bought a cheaper model. EVERY music app for the versa 2 needs a paid perscription to work. So the only music I can play is what I can put together for a playlist, just what I DID NOT want to do. And it won't pair with my bluetooth headphones 😣Update, I thought maybe I could transfer music from my phone to my versa2. NO! You have to have a computer. I haven't had a computer for over 5 years, it's been in the closet. So the music option is useless. Dilemma do I like Alexa well enough to justify not returning🤔🤔 Maybe I should have stuck with my trusty Garmin.",4
1,I was very happy with my Versa Flex2 overall. There were intermittent issues with text notifications that were resolved each time by a reset…kind of annoying though. Three months ago the text feature stopped working and now after 13.5 months of daily wear the battery won’t hold a charge..my tracker is useless…I expected more from Fitbit.,3
0,"7/2020- UPDATE*****I really wanted to love this watch- I am finally trading up for an Apple 5- I’m sick of having to restart/ reload the app and watch itself- not tracking/ app freezes, send notifications to update and sync. Bluetooth does not work, I’ve done all of the fixes Fitbit suggests. Too much work for simple tracking-I really wanted to love the Versa 2.Everything works EXCEPT the text notification.I have read every review on how to connect, but it still won’t.I will be returning the Versa 2 for the Versa lite.",1
1,"I do not wear watches any longer because they irritate me to no end. I broke down and had to try this because of the reviews and I wanted a fitness watch. This is a well known brand and others have claimed it to be very comfortable, and they were right. I barely know I have it on. Battery lasts a few days, which is a plus, the only issue I have is that it will not show messages from my phone. It shows when there is a phone call, but no messages. Other than that Iike the watch.",4
1,"Returned first 2 watches I tried as functions did not work, & no good customer support!I love my Versa 2 & my son in Japan (he has Versa Ionic) - we now do “step challenges” as he is on my “friends” list! We did the “weekend warrior” contest!I can also send him a message through the app. I still have to learn more about functions, but am learning. I would like to see a “find my iPhone” option, but it may still come later. Easy to learn & take time to watch a few videos & Fitbit even has a way to chat with you if there is a problem! Great customer service!",5
1,"Works great. Allows me to get text messages if I'm in range of my phone, I can listen to Pandora from wireless headphones (will download 3 of your most listened to stations), I can check the weather, set up speedpay, it has a calculator, and is water resistant (I'm sure it does more, but I don't care past those things).Does NOT have GPS, so if you want to know where you've been, you'll have to bring your phone, was very disappointed about this when I got it.",4
1,"I have a Fitbit One and have loved it more than any other kind of Fitbit or tracker. When the Versa came out, I was tempted, but I refrained. Battery life is important to me- it’s annoying to have to charge every day. Versa 2 came out and I got a good deal on it with the new Amazon credit card so I took the plunge. It looks really nice with an upgraded band! Battery lasts about 4 days and I love being able to change the clock faces. Still not sold on the step accuracy of anything worn on the wrist, but I will have to do some more testing. Love it so far though!",5
1,"I love this watch! Love tracking my daily activities to help me lead a healthier life! Track weight, steps, water, menstrual cycle and can display my messages and call plus play music.",5
0,"I am a new customer to Fitbit and I have not been having a great experience so far. I am previously an apple user and was looking to switch up my products with the android platform. I replaced my apple watch for a Fitbit Versa 2 and now I am regretting the change. I received so many emails about the new Versa 2 that I could not resist given it a try for my replacement from my apple watch. I purchased the watch for over $200 with tax for the Fitbit Versa 2 Bordeaux/Copper Rose watch. I also purchased covers for the watch so it can stay looking new because I like to resale my devices if I ever decide to upgrade. Well, the watch structure is sob pare to say the least, the watchband holder always come detached and is uncomfortable. The watch does not accurately count my steps, it sometimes random powers off and I can turn back on till it gets ready. The Alexa option is one of the things that sold me and that even suck!So I’m thinking “Ok, Ill just sale it” (because it looks like new since it been in a protector case since I wore it) I know I would be out of some money but at least I could get most of it back” WRONG!!!!. After I brought it, it was not a month later the watch had went down to $139. And I’m seeing the watch on eBay for around $100! I guest it was some people who felt the same way as me. I think I should at least get 75% back for the watch since I have had it least then 4 months and been trying to get some money back for after just 2 months of having the device. It is in tiptop shape and pretty but is a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!!I would appreciate a response to this message with a resolution if not I will take future action because I think others should know about this.",1
1,"There are too many awesome features to mention them all. Here are a few:-Accurate heart rate monitor-Clear, responsive screen-Works with so many apps effortlessly and smoothly-Accurate voice to text-Quick to notify you of notifications-Looks sleek and simpleI really don't have anything negative to say. I'd love if it had built in GPS and could be used as a phone to speak to someone.The fitbit versa 2 I think is currently the best combination of health tracking and smart watch features.",5
1,"This Fitbit watch is so comfortable on my wrist, although I was concerned it would be heavy, hot, and cumbersome. Normally I forget that I am even wearing it, until I am reminder of the steps needed to reach my hourly goals. It is great to be able to track my steps through the day and monitor my pulse. Although I am still learning all my Fitbit can do, I also love that my texts and missed calls notifications are right on my wrist, even if I am away from my phone.This is a great product and I would purchase it again.",5
0,"First of all, the amazing color of the band is gorgeous. It keeps perfect timing for exercising, love the aerobic app, the full workout app too. I am in a group with some very Inspiring people, who challenge me daily to exercise. And I LOVE IT. This is the watch to have, it does everything the expensive watches does. This was a good watch but the pictures says it all after my purchase on February 3rd, 2020 and now March 5th, 2022. Oh well, pictures are worth a thousand words and they don't lie. Now I have to search for a new watch.",1
1,"If you use Alexa frequently this is the watch for you. The Mobil app is easy to navigate and alot of customizable features, the sleep tracking is fairly accurate, especially for the price point. Long story short my first Versa 2 started glitching out, stopped working, then started working 100% again. But I loved this watch so much I bought another one, at least I have a backup haha.",4
0,I wasn’t very happy with this product my HR was /is better I had this a few weeks then retired it. I feel that they were trying to make this to look like the Apple Watch. The watch didn’t keep up with itself it was missing sleep patterns as well and missing steps the size I was seeming to hit it on things cause of size of face.. it just sober all wasn’t for me my Alta hr seems to be the best fit for me... so I returned this one and went back to the hr. For the money this one does nothing different. I wouldn’t recommend this one too anyone......,2
1,💗 love it. No issues ! Super easy to set up and that’s saying a lot because I’m challenged when it comes to setting up electronic devices:). No connectivity issues especially at work where there sometimes is. Love the band.. I had an issue with the rubber band and the buckle with a rash around the buckle. So I got this hoping that it was the combo of the metal and rubber and sweating causing irritation. Absolutely no issues with this one. I wear all the time and take it off only to charge and shower. Love this device:),5
0,"It looks like I may have already done a review for this product. However, after having an a year and a half it just all of a sudden died. I did not drop the product or immerse in water or anything. At first the battery kept dying on me so I had to keep charging it every other night. Last night, I had to charge it . This morning I saw that holy at 97% charge. Then tried to wake it up so I could actually see other info and it completely died on me. When I contacted the customer service for Fitbit they had me do several things I had already done. They then determined that it was dead. They told I would get an email to find out what my choices were and because it’s over the one-year warranty They’re going to give me 35% off of a new one. A 35% off only last 30 days.Again I haven’t done anything wrong with the product and since it cost almost $200 I feel this is not worth your time or money. Their products should last a lot longer than a year and a half. This is my third product from this company. Each device only last thing a little more than a year. The cost way too much for this product to last only a year. I will no longer use anything from the Fitbit company any more. That is ridiculous.",2
0,"You pay for what you get. I chose this over the apple and the farming because of price and I wasn’t too picky about it. The first time I put it on, the battery was at 83% and it lasted 4 or 5 days with no issues! I was excited about that. However, if you ever walk while pushing a cart or stroller, it doesn’t count those steps... just an FYI. Well... a couple days later it wouldn’t hold a charge for more than 8 hours. I couldn’t figure out why and then this morning I woke up and the screen was flickering and the color was off. So I charged it to 100% and it still looked like this. This was never dropped or submerged in water, so I have no idea what caused the issue... maybe a faulty battery? Regardless, I don’t think it’s worth the money.",2
1,"The watch is great. The strap is not great so I bought an additional strap with the watch. I like almost everything about the qatch. I don't like the premium features that cost money. And I won't use them. But they stripped some of the features and placed them in the premium subscription. The alexa is lagging some times. I would prefer Google assist but for timer and reminders alexa is ok... Most of the time. Anyway the accuracy is great and fun to do exercise and running. If I loose it or break it, I'll buy another piece of the same watch again.",4
0,"I had a terrible experience with my Versa 2. The first one quit charging after only 9 months and the replacement that Fitbit sent me started having issues a little over a year later (2 months after the extended warranty ended). More specifically, the side button and the auto screen wake motion sensor quit working on that 2nd one.I contacted customer support and was told ""[...] They're made to last, however, there is not an infallible way to ensure that no issues will present in the long run. [...]"" I guess the definition of ""long run"" varies but 2 out of 2 Fitbits have not lasted me for more than 1.5 years.I am giving it two stars since customer support did not hesitate replacing the watch while I still had warranty. Would not buy again.",2
0,"I bought this May 11th 2021 and it is now August 12th 2021 and my Fitbit versa screen is going in and out of color and having severe static to the point where it's almost completely a white screen. This is 4 months into this product and it's having this bad of an issue? It was bad enough when the first two versas I had only lasted a year each? For the amount that these were purchased for I would think they should last two or more years.If someone else has had this issue and they found a way to correct it I would really appreciate a response as I do like the devices itself and the program.I may have to switch, maybe to a Garmin, if this is going to be how Fitbit wastes my money.",1
1,"The display is much more user friendly than the charger3, and I like the shape of this watch better. However, it interprets as light sleep when I'm awake at night, reading quietly. The heart rate tracker is frequently off (compared it's readings to a home ekg, as I have cardiac symptoms that I wanted to monitor). The step counter is really accurate, though. The battery doesn't last very long, just a couple of days.Unfortunately, there is a software update for the versa 2, but my phone won't sync w the watch to do the update, so none of the tracking shows up in the Fitbit app. Disappointing.",3
0,"The battery lasts days and it's easy to charge once you need to. It works perfectly for what it's designed for.Updated - have been using this for a few months and it suddenly loses its charge, and stops working completely. I could charge it, get to 100% and then by halfway through the day it won't track my steps or workouts and won't sync with the app. I'll plug it in if I'm lucky enough to see a low battery alert, and sometimes it takes a while for the charger to start working too. Do yourself a favor and splurge for the Apple Watch.",2
0,I replaced my Fibit Versa after about 3 years for a Versa 2. I bought in October and it stopped working today.Went blank. I contacted Fibit and they offered to replace it without hassles.I really like this watch. I will give it another try for sure. I think my model was faulty.,2
1,"Love the battery life, way better than apple watch. The design is also as sleek as apple watch. But two things really annoy me. One is the motion sensor, it is not that sensitive, sometimes I have to turn my wrists a few times to active the display, it is so annoying that I plan to return it. Second, you have to change the clock face by using the phone app, sucks again. Love other things but stilk going to return it.",3
0,Returned due to impossible to change band. Ordered replacement bands and clear covers but after setting up majority of watch decided I wanted different band. Well after two hours of fighting to replace decided to put back on original band thinking there was a problem maybe thickness but measured it appeared identical but again unable to even put back together. Bottom line never got to use watch You would think nowadays they would make it easier to change bands. Really disappointed While talking to my granddaughter had same issue. Why in the world would a manufacturing company do this knowing people like change Don’t generally write a negative note but just warning those don’t buy unless you like the struggle of your life to just change bands,1
1,"The media could not be loaded.
 Loved this watch while it lasted.Never went swimming or got the watch wet deliberately, yet the screen just crapped out. Flickering weird like it had it sitting under water for hours.The actual app and health monitoring systems are amazing and it's the only reason this watch isn't getting 1*.Great heart rate and sleep monitoring. Fairly easy to set up. So-so 3rd party apps and step counter.Overall if this item didn't break so quickly I'd be recommending everyone to try this smart watch. Sadly poor build quality severely impacts my recommendation. I would find something that's more solidly manufactured if you want a watch that lasts.If you wanna blow $170 on this watch that you just wanna try, qnd don't care if it breaks in 6 months, then I guess give it a go.Otherwise I'd recommend against this watch, solely due to poor manufacturing quality and performance over time.",3
0,Can’t get a human being for customer service. Every time I go to check on why I cannot use Alexa or get my text messages I follow instructions for an app and that’s it. Those instructions don’t work and there are no means to contact Anyone. I just keep getting redirected through the instructions. I follow them to the letter it still does not work and I cannot talk to a human being about it. Very dissatisfied. It only does what my original Fitbit dead which was track my steps and alerts me of my phone calls. That’s it,1
0,"When you spend $200 + for a Fitbit it comes as a surprise that if you want to see how many steps you have gone AND the distance you have to pay extra for a clock face that gives you that. It’s like paying $ 200.00 for a watch and then being told that for an extra $1.50 they will actually put numbers on the watch. It’s insulting and extremely cheap on the part of Fitbit. I went back to my older version Fitbit which actually had the number of steps, distance, time, battery strength and heart rate included. I will never buy another Fitbit if you have to pay extra to actually get your readings. I use to love Fitbit and have been a loyalCustomer for years. Never again",1
1,"I had an older Fitbit that was great but started acting up so I purchased this one. It does work but some features like texts and answering phone like the older one, does not work on iPhone. It will interstate some but not all alerts. Very frustrating. The app is great though. It kept info from previous watch.",3
0,I bought this watch for the sleep tracking and Oxygen tracker for use with IOS 11 Plus I phone. The sleep tracker did not work hardly at all. I checked with Fitbit technical 3 times. We reset watch and it would work partially that night and then not the next. It says needs 3 hours before it will track. I would sleep for 6-8 hours and it would tell me I had not slept for over 3 so it could not track. The last Tech I talked to said it was a problem with watch connecting to IOS phone. It never worked correctly and was definitely not worth the money. I returned after 1 week and Amazon returned my payment. I would not recommend buying this watch if you want to track sleep and O2.,2
0,"This is a part time watch, it works part time and most of the time it's aggravating! You are supposed to tap the watch face twice to activate the watch. How about tapping the watch for five minutes and getting no response, YOU'LL love that feature. When it does respond slide the screen to the left and features will start appearing and you'll probably be able to use them, then the Versa 2 will respond. Today when I went for a walk I couldn't activate it and wouldn't you guess that when I returned home, it was ready to be activated. S o on a part time basis it is essentially worthless We have 2 and a half million people in Las Vegas and there no place to take this watch for assistance. How do you get a watch to perform like it should, perhaps Fitbit could answer that. And I'll bet they don't and won't!",1
0,"The first watch I received wasn't staying charged, and kept having issues syncing with my phone so I ordered a replacement. The replacement was missing the large band. And the packaging was destroyed someone had smashed everything back in the box. I called and asked for a second replacement which arrived very promptly. Amazon said it was not necessary for me to return the one missing the band. So when the second replacement arrived I attempted to charge both. The first replacement, one from the damaged box, did not work at all it wouldn't even charge. The second seems to be working okay for the first day, but had also previously been opened and also had not been factory reset, so it had a text and missed call displayed from a prior user. Which is extremely irritating. Looking at the fitbit app reviews there are a lot of connectivity issues in the last couple months and I am done requesting replacements since amazon has now sent not one but two previously opened products when I originally paid for a brand new fitbit. Not pleased in the least.",1
0,"I purchased a Versa2 on Jan 15 2020.Initially i assumed the run distance was reliable. Then i started notice a discrepancy with other apps. Error was quite high. Then I started estimated the distance also on the maps, before running and I realized I had at least a 15% underestimated distance. By this time, I am just out of the Amazon return window.I am chatting wth Fitbit customer support. Instead of pointing me to their warranty, they only point me to the Amazon return policy and for the rest they state: ""Fitbit devices calculate distance by multiplying your walking steps and walking stride length. This will not necessarily match a pre-measured distance, nor will it show exactly what a GPS device will show.""So, beware, you will be buying a $150 watch that the company knows will not do the simplest thing, measure the distance you run, relying on the phone GPS!!!One may wonder the accuracy of everything elseDO NOT BUY.",1
1,"El contador de pasos es muy inexacto. Todos los días despierto con 100+ pasos, y he visto que el contador aumente mientras haces actividades que requieren de un movimiento repetitivo del antebrazo.El medidor cardiaco es bueno, pero comparandolo con los resultados del que usan médicos está de 3 a 5 bpm debajo.Lo único de lo que me puedo quejar es de la sincronización con la aplicación móvil. Me tomó algo más de una hora poderlo configurar porque no había forma de que mi celular lo detectara. Tuve que probar todas las posibles soluciones que encontré en los foros y no tengo la menor idea de cuál fue la que me ayudó a finalmente sincronizarlo.Es una pena que el fitbit no vibre si tienes las notificaciones del celular en no molestar, sería una buena opción el poder tener comportamientos diferentes en le celular y en el reloj.En lo demás, me parece bueno.",3
0,"I loved this product for as long as I could wear it--easy to use, easy to track and very user-friendly. However, I had to stop wearing it after I began experiencing pain in my hand/arm. I wore the Fitbit Versa 2 on my left wrist for about a week and a half, during the day only. On day 9, I noticed tingling in my left hand. I took it off and put it back on the next day and the tingling turned into pain that radiated from my hand, up my arm and into my rib cage. I took it off for about an hour and switched hands, only to have right hand start to tingle.I researched these symptoms and they appear to be a problem for a some others, however, when I contacted Fitbit, they denied hearing about these problems at first, then later responded that only a small percentage of people experience them. I am returning the product.",2
1,"I LOVE my Fitbit! It actually makes me move more because I want to hit my hourly step goal, so when I would normally stay seated I get up to finish however many steps needed to reach my goal. My tracker let's me know how many I need and let's me know when I am done once I start walking around. I love that it connects to my fitness pal and keeps track of calories burned. I even like the little firework show for reaching my family steps. I am an extremely beginner exersize so this really has helped me get moving! It's pretty too :)",5
0,"Stopped working after only a few weeks. The screen went fuzzy green with a line through it. Did a troubleshoot with Fitbit chat. Restarted Fitbit and it worked well for a few more days then did it again. This time it wouldn’t reset for 24 hours.

1,So I was extremely excited to receive this watch. It’s great BUT it wouldn’t connect to my WiFi.. I tried for a day and a half even calling customer support. I ultimately decided to return it. It’s not worth it to me if I can’t enjoy all the functions because it’s very limited using just Bluetooth. Going to try an Apple Watch instead.,4
0,"So when I got the Fitbit versa 2, I was very excited to add this to my into my life but it didn’t work like i wanted it to. It does keep track of my sleep and all that stuff but when I realized it didn’t take blood pressure that’s a negative because even the cheap watches to that. Also it’s very sensitive when it comes to steps so I could be sitting there driving my car and all of a sudden I’m at 300 steps so it makes me feel like it’s very in accurate and on a day where I go maybe 15,000 steps are 10,000 steps with the watch on I don’t feel like it’s true like I have no trust in the product. I had more luck with a $40 smart watch.",1
0,"This watch does not work at all. It does not track anything accurately. I would not suggest wasting your time. I returned it and bought the Samsung Galaxy Active 2 watch and I am in love as it does track perfectly for sleep, every step you tack, EKG, heart rate etc. Don't waste your time on this watch though. You will end up returning it too.",1
1,"I wanted to upgrade to the .Versa 2 and was especially interested in the Alexa function. Well it rarely works. Your device needs to be within 30 feet, but even then it rarely works. I have several devices, iPhone, 2 iPads and have trouble accessing info on the app unless 2 of the devices have the Bluetooth turned off. I spend too much time fooling around with my devices trying to get it to sync. If you only have 1 device you'd probably like this. I do like the larger screen and app choices. Overall, I like this except for the syncing problems.",3
1,"I love this Fitbit, it has help motivate me to move, provided insight and is fun. I find the app easier then the watch to navigate. Very difficult to get to where you want to go on the watch itself. I returned the one i bought from amazon. Found it cheaper elsewhere. I am very disappoint that Amazon did not return my money, but gave me a gift card. I did not ask for that and it was like. Well, you can buy it cheaper someplace else, but we are keeping your money. Very disappointing indeed...",5
1,"I really like my Fitbit. I contemplated buying one for over a year before I got this one. Very glad that I did. I love the rewards for reaching my goals on it. It keeps me motivated. The mobile App can be a little glitchy sometimes but I don’t mind. I’m not in to sleeping with anything on my wrist. The idea of someone tracking my sleep freaks me out a little bit, and I don’t like to feel restricted by anything while I sleep. 🤔😉",5
1,"Pros:Can do 90%of what an apple or Samsung watch can do.Great fitness tracking.. with the motivated promps to get up and walk. its really helpful when I dont even realize I've been sitting at my desk all day.Moderate:Set the watch setting to placed on your dominent hand yet wear it on you non-dominent. By doing this, you will get a more accurate count of steps.Cons:The bluetooth range seems odd, if my phone is in another room in the house, I will recieve notification and be able to read an incoming text BUT I'll be told there are connectivity issues when I try to respond. Also, I thought while going to the gym, I could keep my phone in my locker and still get notifications on my watch. Nope.Also, theres no 'fall defection' I feel like this is important feature or a fitness watch.Overall, ok the issues I have would say I should have bought a Samsung watch, but while these items are cons, they are not dealbreakers.. mirrorless, disappointments.",4
1,"I like that I can easily check the time at night by just rotating my wrist, and the display is big enough to easily read. It seems to give a more accurate step count, and quickly learned my routine of afternoon dog walks, so it automatically tracks them. I got the rose gold with the purple wine band and it goes with a lot of my outfits. I was able to get some extra fancier wristbands on Amazon. I love it.",5
1,"I thought about buying this for like 4 months. Now it has been a year and even though I paid a little more for it I don’t regret it. Not a single second. It’s lightweight, amazing tracker for every exercise. I love doing HIIT and it just wonderful the way it showed you your peaks, calories, heart rate. If you really want a fitness tracker with something else... this is the one for you. But DON’T expect a bunch of apps and fancy functions. Like Apple Watch.",5
1,"I’m having a lot of difficulty getting Alexa added on my watch and it keeps saying do you want to quit Alexa just trying to open the mobile app. It’s like There’s some kind of glitch. At times the phone and watch stop connecting to each other and even 2 other Bluetooth headphones show as added but nothing happens when I select them. It’s almost like Fitbit offers all of these awesome features but none of them work at all or even most of the time. It’s highly disappointing. My last Fitbit just stopped syncing and had trouble even charging, so I couldn’t access any info off of it anymore. Just makes me think I should try other brands or just pay more for the Apple Watch if the quality of these are so poor...🤷🏾‍♀️. I will contact CS to see if they can assist because I have not done that yet and I pray it’s easily rectified.",3
1,Love my Fitbit 2. Big step up from my previous Fitbit. Have nothing negative to say. I am very pleased. Having Alexa is an added bonus. One word of advice don’t let your battery die out completely it takes at least 45 minutes before it starts a charge. I was very nervous when it wouldn’t start charging once connected to it’s charger. Did a little research on line to find out a complete drained battery can take up to 2hrs for a full charge..,5

1,First this is a great smart watch but has a big flaw. Hint the 3 star. I have a tattoo sleeve and the watch can’t track your sleep or heart rate through the tattoo ink. Now when I put it on my other wrist it works perfectly. This is a flaw. I had cheaper watches that worked through the ink but this versa 2 for now doesn’t. Battery is great when u turn off the all day sync . I get 6-7 days now opposed to 4 with it on and movements wake up on. Great watch with a flaw hopefully they will fix and then I will change review,3
0,"Please do not purchase these watches. Customer Service is terrible; besides you have to suscribe to a membership aplication in order to obtain all of the benefits of the watch.

They offered me a 25% discount on a watch of lesser value and that's all they would do, even though I believe it was a factory defect and they should have wanted to do more. I got the newer model, but bought and extended warranty after reading other similar reviews. It connected to my Text Message + when I first connected it to my phone and already it is not working anymore.Disappointed",3
1,This is awesome! I have a tiny wrist and it’s still comfortable. It works better with android as far being able to call and text from the Fitbit (mine is paired with iOS and I just get notifications but I’m fine with that...my guess is eventually it will catch up) it has so many new cool features and more you can download. I waited a couple of months because I have had issues with Fitbit in the past but so far I have had no problems with this one. It syncs better than past Fitbit and charges faster. Well worth it!,5
0,"It will give you a headache to link it to your phone. I had to watch videos to get it link to my phone and it was hard to find the one that actually helped me, plus I wasted a lot of time on doing it. The app is confusing and you have to go to the actual website to change the language bucause there is not an option on the watch or the phone. The battery does not last long. You have to pick only 1 option to get your messages on the watch (regular messeges or whatsapp).I am dissapointed because it was a gift for my Mom and I had trouble to set it up for her. I have a samgung active watch and I did not struggle with any of that.",2
0,One month out of warranty the watch screen went to a flickering blue green white. If I weren't so pissed off I would say that the color show is really cool :|Contacted Fitbit and was offered a discount to buy a new one. Can't afford to throw away a smart phone every year.Piece of Cr@p electronics. Buy something reliable.,1
1,Switched from a Garmin because I wanted something more streamlined that looked less like a sports watch. The sleep tracking is so much better on this than the Garmin but I wish it gave a few more workout stats. I miss the overall rating that Garmin gives after a workout. The battery is not quite as good as my Garmin either but I like the look of this much better for going to work and it was much less expensive than my Garmin.,5
1,"Had this for just over a week, and am very impressed so far:The Good:+ Battery life. I'm nearly getting a week with low to average use.+ The fit. Very comfortable, thin, and looks good even on my childlike wrist+ Navigation. It's pretty simple compared to something like a Samsung Active. Uncomplicated.+ The app. Reasonable intuitive, clean layout, basic info is all up front+ Paired and plays nicely with my OnePlus - no issues to date+ Active community and support+ Great value foe moneyThe Bad:- The charging dock design is extremely poor- Sleep tracking seems hit or miss... mostly miss- Step counts tend to vary by plus or minus 300 for the same 20 minute walk- Custom watch faces can be expensive, but that's the community setting the price- Lack of GPS, though it's not a deal breaker at allUpshot - if you want a quality tracker which is simple to use, then the Versa 2 should be on your shortlist.",5
1,"only dislike is you have to choose your face surround carefully. Don’t get rose gold or black, etc if that isn’t what you want to wear ALL the time. Only the band itself it interchangeable. The app and watch are easy to use. You can download up to 5 different watch faces to find the one that suits you best. Some are free and some you can buy for nominal fees. Only complaint is the face isn’t flat so the anti-breakage glass face protectors are expensive. I’m not brave enough to try to put one on with the way they adhere.",5
0,"I'm really disappointed that this watch didn't work out. I love being able to receive my notifications and track my steps on a watch, but this one is not worth the money at all. In order to receive your notifications, your phone can't be on do not disturb, which is a problem for me. The reason I like smart watches is because they can discreetly tell me about specific types of notifications while my phone is on do not disturb, but not being able to use the watch and do not disturb at the same time defeats the point. Additionally, I had significant problems connecting my fitbit and keeping it connected. I had to download the latest iOS for it to connect initially, then had to restart my phone every day because for some reason, it would disconnect overnight and wouldn't sync unless I restarted my phone. Too much hassle.",2
0,"Extremely frustrated.This watch is not registering my sleep, my heart rate, or my steps on a consistent basis. For instance, I had spent all day cleaning on Friday, however it said I had only walked 71 steps. And as someone recovering from COVID, I’ve been relying a lot on the HR monitor, which will often only display a line, where my HR should read. Finally, I fell asleep last night at 10:30 pm, and my watch didn’t start calculating it until 2:30am, and some nights are not being calculated at all. I am beyond irritated, as this was $140 and is not even working as well as my old Fitbit charge!Also, it is out of 30 day window so I am unable to exchange through Amazon!😠😡🤬",1
1,Read the reviews mentioning a rash but didn’t think much of it because I’ve had many and still own other watches with rubber bands. Have had it on for most of the past 2 weeks and just noticed the rash.Why sell these $hire bands??Also sleep tracking stops if you wake up for a piss and go back to sleep.Additional sleep has to be manually logged in and is not part the night’s analysis.,3
1,"The Fitbit Versa 2 is working very nicely for me. I do not use it for sleep or music. I however do use it to track steps, heart rate, calories burned and other fitness items. The device has worked very nicely in tracking these items and also in tracking my workouts. The Apps are also very nicely provide data and information. It takes some effort to get started and set up, but once you have it setup like you want it, it works very well. Battery life is very good in the display sleep mode, lasts 5 to 6 days. In the always on mode it will only last about 1.5 days. Excellent device for fitness tracking and less expensive than iWatch.",4
0,"I love the color and the look of the watch. It fits well on the wrist. But have some trouble.1) Its difficult to pair the watch with the app i the phone2) It displays BMR Calorie. Thats confusing. I only want the Calorie burnt to be displayed on the watch.3) Watch displays the current heart rate when on the wrist. But will not show the graph. Its not updating on my phone also. When I contacted Fit Bit support, I was told that my phone ""Oneplus 8 pro"" is not compatible with the watch.So i tried to work this out for 3 days and returning now. Will not buy fitbit again.",2
0,"This Fitbit Versa 2 stopped working about 5 months after I received it as a gift from my husband. I can't swipe the face any longer to get to the different screens. It runs out of a charge extremely fast and keeps shutting off and coming back on while I'm wearing it even after a full charge. It now only keeps track of my steps while im wearing it- and even that is ""iffy"". Spent way too much on a fitness watch that only tracks steps. Just very disappointed in this fitness watch.",1
1,"I love this watch and it's absolutely beautiful. It tracks my steps perfectly and helps me stay active, but since I got it it doesn't track my sleep correctly at all. Not even close. It tells me I'm sleeping 2 hours a night and I'm sleeping at least 7-8 hours a night and I can't set a bedtime and wakeup time on the app. Fitbit dropped the ball on this function. But overall I still love it just wish someone could help me with the sleep issue..",4
1,"Given as a gift. Very well received and from all reports, is continuing to be well appreciated and used. It is much more readable than the smaller faced one that I own and I am considering getting this one as well. It works well, connects to the app easily and provides good information about workouts and sleep.",5
1,"My first Versa 2 had the screen fall off (A common problem upon googling it)after having it just over one year. I could not get a replacement, only a discount if I order directly from the company. I tried using an Apple Watch I found it for too complicated. My husband ordered me a new Versa 2 for my birthday. I also ordered a variety of colored screen protectors. Hopefully this will prevent the previous problem.",4
0,"Loved my fitbit until it quit. My first round of fitbits I went through 3 in the 1st year, they replaced they pretty easily... its just for the price I would've thought it would have lasted longer that 5-6 months.When my 1st generation fitbit quit for the 3rd time my husband bought me the next generation. Same story, barely a year. Switched to the Garmin.",2
0,"I had a fitbit before which is the only reason I bought this one. It's sleek looking and comfortable to wear, but it counts steps non stop. It had me counting 40,000 steps and apparently climbing the Sears tower a dozen times while I was DRIVING. I also ran a marathon in my sleep.I searched for ways to change the sensitivity, but there was no fixing it. I sent it back.",2
1,"Upgraded from a fitbit charge 2. Like that the Always On feature is optional, so my battery lasts 2weeks! I like that there is a couple free clock watch faces that allow you to upload your own personal pictures!!! All other features work just like they did on my Charge which lasted me 2 years. Bought a couple extra metal bands, make sure to look for copper rose gold if you want it to match the color of the watch!",5
0,"After a week or so, I could not get my fit bit versa2 to sync to my Samsung S9+, even though it previously did. I planned to return it, but waited too long & was one day past the return date. So, after several attempts of fixes, taking several hours of searching the internet taking several days, (you get the picture) something I did made it start connecting again. Now I'm afraid to change any settings on my phone, but I have all kinds of alerts & notices going off & I have no idea what they are! It is so frustrating. Definately not worth the price.",2
1,I bought several other more expensive smart watches and sent them back. This is very comfortable and the watch size isn't to big and bulky. It has all the extras I wanted. I can view my incoming text messages and use as a phone. I love the Alexa feature and use it alot. I also workout so this meets all my needs. I have on sync issue. But its a definite keeper!,5
0,I loved the watch but waiting on my second replacement for a month and it is still not there but they won't consider it lost because it is still getting scanned. 2nd time the display has went out you can look on the app and it works just no display. I ask for an extended warranty since they have had it part of my year waiting on replacement no such luck. I wouldn't recommend based on customer service and the fact it won't last a year with no physical damage to the unit.,1
0,"The watch worked great until the front of the watch fell. I was sitting in a chair and went to look at the time and the face of the watch fell off. I contacted customer service, since the watch was six months old and had a one year warranty. They asked for me to send a picture of the watch and they said “They would see what they could do about the watch.” That was one week ago and I have heard nothing from them. I had to buy a Casio watch to replace this one. I know that they hold up much better than this one did.",1
0,"I've now had two Fitbit Versa 2's, and the experience has been the same. While this product would be immensely helpful if it worked as designed, it frequently does not. It often has trouble syncing with the mobile app, and when it does you don't get any notifications of texts, calls, or any other app. Additionally, the Alexa assistant, the primary reason I purchased another Fitbit Versa 2 after my first one had it's primary button fail, also frequently doesn't work. Often time Alexa will ""forget"" important timers or reminders, to the point where I will often set a timer and then immediately ask to ""see my timers"" to ensure it was actually set. Overall, the glitchiness detracts from any of the positive factors, and I won't be purchasing another Fitbit product anytime soon.",1
0,"Please read reviews and blogs re the Versa 2. My experience is typical. Despite multiple reloads, updates, etc. it never was able to track my bike rides faithfully. It often captured but half the ride (and yes, i started in connnected mode with a pixel 4xl). It can't track your full sleep patterns if you wake up at some point, briefly--it won't join two sleep periods if one is less than 3 hours and for many of us that's a real problem. And like many, i developed a rash from wearing it, and no cleaning or setting it aside for weeks and trying again solves the problem. I've never had that problem with a watch before (its the back of the watch, not the band). Its not decorative enough to leave on my dresser, so its a lost cause.",2
0,"I hate to give this negative review because I know their engineers have been trying to fix the problems. Even downloaded one update to it since I bought it 5 months ago but the shortcomings persist. Admittedly, it is an attractive piece and the available clock faces are many and beautiful. But the heart rate monitor is very inaccurate when I compare it to the proven-accurate Polar heart rate monitor I have long used during the same exercise sessions - the Versa 2 average bpm is about 20 bpm too fast and the maximum bpm is about 40 bpm too fast. And the sleep tracking function has never worked right - since day 1 it has told me I sleep 2-3 hours per night and gives me terrible scores for such short duration when in fact I sleep 7-8 hours per night. I have run out of hope that these main problems and a few other ones will be fixed in another software update.",2
0,"I got this because I liked my Blaze so much I figured the Versa 2 would be great. Sadly it’s only greatness is it’s disappointment. In less than 2 months all functionality has stopped. Around 45 days it stopped swiping. Around day 50 it stopped tracking stairs. Day or so later it stopped responding at all. I followed all the advice from their pages to restart, factory reset, let the battery drain completely then charge.... nothing helped. I am trying to get support to replace it.I do not recommend this to anyone. If their support doesn’t resolve this I will be looking for another brand.",1
0,"I really loved the features and feel of this wristband when I first used it. After about 6 months of use however, I started to feel frequent numbness in my hand. At first, I thought I might have started to have carpal tunnel. However, when I took it off to charge, I noticed my hand was pain free. I tried putting the Versa 2 on loosely, as well as on my other wrist (I then began to feel numbness in my other hand), but the numbness never stopped. I read online about others going through the same issue. Luckily for me, I no longer am experiencing any numbness or tingling since I stopped wearing the product. Sadly, I will now be in the market for another fitness tracker.",1
0,I was in love with my new Versa 2 until I went to put it on and it slipped off of my wrist and shattered. It is only a couple of weeks old. Called Fitbit and they would not replace or fit because it was my fault that it fell. How could falling roughly 2.5 feet make it shatter? They do not sell replacement screens or any way to fit it. I would have to buy a whole new one. I can’t believe how fragile it is.,2
1,Upgraded this Fitbit versa 2 from an earlier model. Really enjoyed the wallet feature and texts notifications. Found if I was walking and pushing my granddaughters stroller step count was inaccurate and lower. After 8 mo it just quit working. Never got it wet or banged it that I know of. It’s super humid in San Diego so I sweat? Dunno. Will return it but have no idea if they’ll honor warranty.,4
1,"The watch doesn't keep accurate step count. I can't get it to track sleep at all. Doesn't give enough bio feedback. No blood pressure. no pulse ox, no skin temperature. My wife says it will start counting steps accurately once it learns. Took her Fitbit about a month. Other than that it's a fine watch.",3
1,"I have been a Fitbit owner and user since 2010 and I've owned at least five various models. I currently own a Fitbit Versa, which has just completely crapped out after 20 months of continuous use. I realize that there are lots of people who always like to have the latest and newest and I am NOT one of them. I want to think that after I spend $150 bucks it might be built to last a wee bit longer. I am switching fitness trackers, I'm done spending this much on stuff that doesn't last.",3
0,I have been a FB customer since the FB one. I bought the Versa 2 and really only want two things out of it. Track exercise and get texts from my phone. Getting texts was so convoluted and I had to turn on text show preview always. I dont want texts readable from a locked screen. I even worked with the nice people at tech support and just didnt like the solution so I sent i back.now Im paying $50 more for an Iwatch 3.,2
0,"I cannot believe how inaccurate this thing is. The first time I used it, I went up and down my stairs of my house once, then looked at it and it said I had walked 150 steps. Probably 5-6 times what I had actually walked. By the end of the few hours I used it, it was so wildly off from my actual steps that I gave up on it. Doing a quick online search shows this is a very well known issue. If the device is bad at what it was originally designed to do... why would I want it?",1
1,"I truly love Fitbit products, but unfortunately they tend to have issues. I got my Versa 2 in May and mid July the screen just went black.I contacted Fitbit and I’m waiting for my replacement, but overall I’m not surprised it had issues.I highly recommend getting additional insurance with any Fitbit products because you will have problems!",3
1,I think I'm done with fitbit brand. This is the third fitbit I've own that has lasted less then a year. My versa will no longer sync with the app. very frustrating.Update. I contacted Fitbit and they are replacing it. Their customer service is very good. They replaced the last one too. But I still think that there is a problem that they are not lasting more than 10 mos for my current one. So I'll wear the replacement but will no longer spend money on this brand.,3
1,"I love this smartwatch! It's very simple, easy to use, and I can check my messages and email on my wrist and respond without ever taking my phone out. That's great. The only downside, and I'm a little disappointed, is that I cannot play music on my phone and be able to start and stop it on the watch. I have to physically ""download"" music to the watch, and then I have to have bluetooth headphones to be able to listen to it. So that's the only downside. Otherwise, it's great! No problems, and it holds a battery charge for 5 days or more.",4
0,"I had only owned it for a little over 2 weeks and wore the original band that it came with. I did only remove it for charging which occurred every 2-3 days, but because I'm a nurse and wear a watch regularly while washing my hands, it's second nature for me to slide the watch up when I'm drying my hands to prevent moisture from accumulating underneath.About 2 weeks into owning the Versa 2, I had noticed a stinging sensation underneath the watch face. When I removed it I saw what appeared to be a superficial burn. I immediately returned it to Amazon and contacted Fitbit. Will update my review when I hear back from them.After doing a little research it seems to be a common complaint. It's very upsetting to see so many people with burns practically identical to mine from so many different Fitbit devices. Fitbit needs to fix this!!",1
1,I got this because my apple watch was very inconsistent on reporting anything related to steps and exercise. This is so much better. Fitbit rules on excercise tracking and steps. The reason I knocked it down one star is that Alexa is just ok. Unfortunately you have to have Fitbit app open or it doesn’t work at all. I habitually close my apps and therefore Alexa isn’t there when I need her.,4
1,"The watch is attractive. The software is the problem. The APPS free until you want the best.or a certain APP..then it cost...monthy or yearly payments for premium. I did not go that far to pay for the best APPS so I do not know how they worked. The mobile app is difficult. Once you down load an APP...and if you don't want it....It shows up on the watch says if you want to continue using this app...it give a website.....and a code. It is all difficult to get rid of the alert on the watch. All in all, I returned the watch.",3
1,"Great improvements over previous model [Versa]Battery is now lasting 5 5 1/2 days.Performs well in areas I want to follow.HOWEVER,editing is absolutely beyond me.Would like to change temp from celsius to fahrenheit and date to month/day'year.and adjust BMI data but directions don't help me.Editing definitely not user friendly.Frustrating.",4
0,When it works it works great. BUT it only syncs when it wants to. No matter what you do it will not sync unles it wants to. No rhyme or reason how or why. I have tried everything recommended and some things not discussed. It often loses days at a time. When it works I love it. I especially like the way it records heartbeat (when it wants to). The Charge 2 never let me down which is why I bought this one. Let the buyer beware.I had purchased a metallic watch band with a magnetic closure. Thinking that may have been the problem I replaced it with a metallic watchband without a magnetic. Now my syncing problems seem to have been corrected.,2
1,"My husband bought me this watch for Christmas of 2019. In Sept., the display screen popped out. It was still under warranty so they replaced it. Two days ago, I went swimming with it on. It's dead now, I mean absolutely fried. I wish I had taken the earlier incident with the screen as a sign to buy the protective case. Do yourself a favor if you plan on swimming with this watch, buy a good, waterproof protective case. Besides that, I love the Versa 2 and I do plan on buying another, probably not a Versa 2 but another Fitbit.... maybe.",3
1,I am 68 years young since I have had it I have lost 1 lb per day 31 total I have avg walking 5631 steps. I monitor my sleeping and have learned to relax much better. I never miss texts or phone calls. I have survived a stroke and 4 heart attacksAnd this watch has me walking and enjoying my grandkids again. LIFE CHANGING,5
1,"I bought this to replace my Charge 2 when the screen mysteriously started dimming, and then eventually died. This is such an improvement! The screen is brighter and easier to read, even in broad daylight when running. It also has a cool flashlight function for those night time trips to the bathroom.The sleep and heart rate functions seem to be working accurately. Battery life is great.And finally, the syncing issues I was having with the Charge 2 have been completely eliminated with the Versa 2. It takes me only seconds to sync up, whereas before it would often take several minutes.Even though I've only had the Versa 2 for a couple of weeks, I am extremely pleased.",5
1,"It's a great watch that so far has really helped me keep an eye on my health. My only issue is how fast the battery goes. I have to charge it every 3 days when it's supposed to last a week. My other issue is how much of it is done on your phone. I thought more would be done through the actual watch. 95% of things are done through the mobile app. To me, it kinda defeats the purpose of having a computer on your wrist. So to me, it's not worth the $200.00 but if you want it for health reasons it's great.",3
1,"Suddenly the touchscreen isn't working. I can't use any of the apps or functions. It still tells time, steps, heart rate, etc. Can't leave the clock face though.Works well for tracking steps, water, calories, etc. I use for alarms and reminders as well. It's also connected to my phone and for the most part I get notifications from it. Overall, I love the watch, but there are some problems. Occasionally the watch won't notify me of calls or texts and the watch usually doesn't track my sleep. It usually gives me basic results because for some reason it doesn't think I've slept. Hopefully it'll get better with updates.",4
1,"Love this! I’m still figuring out what all it can do because it has so many extras that I haven’t used yet. The app is great & very easy to use. I’ve never been a watch wearer until now. The watch is comfortable & easy to read at a glance. Seems accurate except for counting some hand movements as steps. Battery lasts for days. I hated spending the money, but I’m so glad I did cause it’s totally worth it. I’ve already lost my quarantine weight gain using it. Too many good things to list. I’m obsessed & extremely glad I purchased It!",5
1,"Love the battery life on this device. It goes for a week+ with a full charge. It gets the steps correct and the hourly motivation is awesome. It easy to setup, but, be prepared to spend about an hour for the device to get its update. Bluetooth and even usb syncing works flawlessly.I also bought it to track my sleep and that’s where it is recording incorrectly. If I wake up in the middle of the night and don’t sleep for 30 min after that, it won’t record the sleep after that. So, I have to manually add it. The wrist strap is sturdy too.",5
1,"I love it even more than I thought I would. This is my first fitness tracker. I've had it for two months, and take it off only once every 4 days or so to charge and detail clean.The text/phone call notifications are handy for when I don't have my phone directly on me, like when working in the yard, OR when at work and we can't be seen using phones.I haven't used Alexa much, but I am trying to figure out if it would be a good thing for my aging parents to have, as in ""Alexa, call 9-1-1"".",5
1,"Got as a Christmas gift. It was very easy to learn and interact with. I really like the app choices to add and enjoy being able to choose different clock faces. There are plenty of choices of free ones too! Amazon Alexa is fun to use too! I have not tried with wireless earbuds or speakers yet but I assume it will be quite simple.If you purchase, do yourself a favor and buy face covers to protect it. I'm quite clumsy and have already hit the wall/door frame a couple times. The full cover I have on it has kept it safe.",5
1,"i like the versa 2 but i have noticed that i can only get about 2.5 days of battery use from it and the syncing is horrible i have to re-sync it all th time and thedn i loose all my tracking on the device, i did go to the website and looked how to restart the fitbit itself and i did that hope it works properly now if not then i will be returning. But over all it was working good for the first couple of days and i really like it , hopefully the reboot worked and i dont have anymore issues. but im really disappointed in the battery life!!!!",3
0,"I love the watch however, the app is not working well with my mobile phone. I still have not been able to connect with my text messages and phone calls. This is an update two and a half months later. This watch cost way too much money for it to go completely dead in a few months time. It was working well until Saturday, February 28th, I put it on the charger so I would not have problems the next day, dead, I tried tapping it, keeping it on the charger, and still nothing. A total dud. Do not buy this watch!!",1
0,"We purchased this watch in November 2019. For the past month we have been unable to swipe the watch screen to see other features. We have gone through troubleshooting steps including resetting the watch several times. Our return option was over in December 2019. Apparently we only purchased a throwaway watch. If we are going to purchase a throwaway watch, there are many different options other than spending the $149 we wasted on this one.BUY SOMETHING ELSE!",2
1,"One downside is I still have troubles with the Versa 2 connecting and staying connected to my phone to receive phone calls, text messages, or other application alerts. I have used the forums and troubleshooted several times, and at this point, I just utilize the watch for sleep tracking, heart rate monitoring for my workouts, and to ensure I get my 10K steps+ per day. I like the look, the fit is great, and the battery life has been superb (5-6 days averaging on a charge).",4
0,"I should have stuck with my Withings... Bought three of these at the same time (one for me, two as gifts). They are pretty much dust collectors now.I do not use anything but the step tracker on mine (no alarms, reminders, Alexa features; anything that can drain the battery except wearing it. Complete bummer.",2
1,I brought this watch for my wife to improve fitness. It is a decent watch but the app will cost $9.99 per month in the App Store for iPhone users!!! Fitbit App which was initially free now has switched to a subscription model. I plan to look for an apple watch which costs more but cheaper without cost for downloading data for iPhone users.5/25/20 Update: The above prompt for usage charge for the app resolved when IOS was updated ( appears to be free for now) I have to now give the watch four stars.,4
1,It’s a cool device. It’s great when running to check heart rate but it has so many bugs. The clock will be wrong on random and syncing the device does not work. I tried to call customer support but after 15 min of trying to give them my email and other information I decided to just send it back. Their customer support sucks!,4
0,"I tested it for 2 weeks and I am still wondering why there are so many positive reviews for it here. This device is a waste of time and money.The worst parts are:1. The app: unacceptable app, it would disconnect all the time and I would have to restart Versa 2 and/or phone. The GPS also keeps disconnecting many times during a walk. It froze multiple times when I was installing a watchface or app and would constantly display popup errors to try again. The apps are mixed up, no ordering based on popularity or something, you have to dig deeply to find good apps. Also you need a computer to add music, you cannot do it over the app.2. Even if it has Wi-fi (by the way still the old 802.11n) it needs to be connected to the phone for everything requiring internet like Alexa or weather. I think Wi-fi is only for transferring music, so stupid.3. I emphasize like before that GPS keeps disconnecting many times during a run.4. Sleep tracker takes a few hours after you wake up to give you the report, should be faster.5. Pedometer is off, it would measure steps when I was clearing the windshield of my car from snow.6. The charger is only used in one direction and you need to remove the case. If the glass was scratch resistant you wouldn't need a case but it's not.7. You need to install Alexa app for Alexa to work so why is it called ""built-in"" Alexa enabled???8. The screen wakes up randomly sometimes with 2 taps, sometimes with 3 taps, sometimes with 10.9. Installing 3-rd party watchfaces or apps is slow and can freeze the device for some reason, had to uninstall all them. If they are not reliable why are they posted on the store?10. Sometimes the Fitbit app needs to run in the foreground for Alexa or GPS to work some other times it doesn't need to run in the foreground but in the background.11. Notifications never seem to work consistently again probably due to sync issues I mentioned above.12. Music transfer is slow even if it is over local Wi-fi.PROS:1. Battery life can give you 4 to 5 days of moderate use.2. Health and sleep tracking capabilities are good compared to other devices in this price range.I am using Android 9 on OnePlus 6T. Even though it is not listed as a supported device it is unacceptable not supporting major phone brands and the latest version of Android. They should have fixed those issues before releasing a device. I have returned Versa 2 and I do not recommend it for the money it asks for. I don't need a watch to do wonders but whatever it says it does should do it right and it's all wrong with Versa 2.",1
1,"Not sure what all of these negative reviews about setup stem from, but I am suspecting people with certain generic or older phones are having issues with the app. I had a charge 2 and upgraded to this watch, already had the app on my Galaxy S10, it took me 5 min to sync and update the watch, piece of cake. It works fine, I'll update my review if an issues arise, but overall no issues.",5
0,"Got my daughter one of these for her birthday. She is an active health conscious kid. While washing her hands and brushing her teeth for bed, the watch fell off of the counter and to the floor. She picked it up and the screen was not broken but it was completely white. The watch was dead, no way to reboot it, called and talked to customer service and they said there is no warranty for accidental damage. The fitbit was 1 month old. They did offer to give us 35% off a new one. Well no thanks.....if it can't withstand a simple drop, it must be worthless. Buyer beware, these must be cheap.",1
0,Skip the Versa 2 and buy something else. It's sleek and works fine but they don't last. I have used Fitbit from the very beginning and i loved the brand but the Versa's are garbage. I went through multiple Versa's with little wear or tear. I never got them wet but the screen always popped out. I decided to try the versa 2 hoping this would be better and a little over a year I'm returning and getting my money back on another Versa. Luckily i purchased the insurance. I won't be purchasing another one.,1
1,"I love the ease of use, accuracy, the looks and appearance of it. The battery life is good too. It was so simple to setup with the app and start using right away I really love the pink color also. I've received lots of compliments on it and would recommend this to anyone wanting to track. It also has some convenient alarms, timers etc that really come in handy. When it's connected to bluetooth I can read/see my phone calls and messages also.",5
0,"It was fine while it worked but at just over a year since I received it the, watch face quit working completely. Contacted fitbit and after having me restart the device which didn’t fix the issue i was transferred to the warranty department who sent an email saying that my issue was outside the parameters of the warranty…. Whatever that means. This is the 2nd fitbit device that has stopped working on me at just over a year old. Will not be repurchasing another.",1
1,"The fitbit versa 2 works great. The only real issue I have with this product is with the band. 2 issues, 1. I don't know what the band is made out of but I developed a rash the second day of wearing it. 2. It is real hard chamfered the band. I found another band that works with this product where I don't break out and changing it was not easy took me 5 minutes. But the electronic part of it is great.",4
0,"Have had this Versa 2 for 3 months and it died!!!!!! It is an exFitbit. I tried to recharge it,, thinking perhaps that the battery was empty. That's when it became too hot to touch.Still trying to get a response from Fitbit. Their Customer Service has been very poor.. They did promise to send me a new one, but that has yet to happen. There has been no communication from them.My first Fitbit lasted for 2+ years, so I was confident in purchasing a new one. So far, this has not been a good experience.",1
1,"I bought a Versa 2 on June 1st and was very impressed with it. It automatically tracked my exercise and sleep. But when ioI too it off for a few hours on June 3rd, it said I was sleeping, and showed stages of sleep (light, deep, light, REM) and even me waking up a few times, I realized that Fitbit fakes it. And if it fakes that, what else does it fake? Can I trust anything from them? I'm going to return my Fitbit. I maybe the exercise stuff works; I haven't been able to independently test it, but sleep tracking is very prominent and very false.",3
0,"After spending $260 on this watch, it worked properly for 4 months and began ""ghost typing"" after 6. Around the year mark, the display began to flicker and go out repeatedly (until restarted and then would repeat within two minutes). When I finally reached out to the company, I was told that the only available option despite the continuous issues was a 35% discount on a new product. This makes this the most expensive watch I have ever purchased at more than $60 per month of operation and the only choice given to me by the company is to try it again on a new model.",1
0,"I've waited a whole year until I was able to purchase this item. Now that I was able to it's going back. The set up wasn't all that easy. My calls and mssgs were not popping up on the watch.

I'll be returning tomorrow.I actually got more action out of a off brand Fitbit than this lol",1
1,"The Fitbit Versa 2 has been an excellent tool in relation to my post open heart surgery recovery. It helps me track steps and exercise and coordinates with United Health Care apps. The heart rate monitor is very accurate. It tracks sleep time, water consumption, weight, and other features which can be customized to the watch.. A very helpful tool for anyone needing to monitor their life patterns.",5
1,So first off I had the Blaze awhile back and while it was really good at everything except staying connected to my phone. I had not used it and then I saw the Versa 2 and bought it. The battery life is great! The step count could really be better. If I wave my arm etc it will count that as a step. The app is ok but I think it could be better. Sleep tracking seems to work fine but you have to pay for premium to get extended results and I don't appreciate that. It does do a good job of staying paired to my phone though.,4
0,"For the past 2 years my husband and I wanted to get a Fit Bit watch. Smart watches are in now and the technological capabilities of the watch really spiked our interest as we wanted to start to get fit. I finally bought mine on Cyber Monday and I was really excited to receive my new watch. To add the color was amazing, after all purple is my favorite color. The set up was straight forward and easy and I was able to wear my new watch in no time. The watch was good for the first 2 days then I realized that my hand felt like something was sticking it. I soon realized that is was the light on the back of the watch. It is so irritating no matter how much I adjusted the band. I was excited about the idea of tracking my steps and then I realized it was tracking steps as I was driving. Like really. Makes me question if the other items being tracked are even accurate. It has been less than a month wearing this watch and I have already gotten tired of this watch almost seems like a waste of money. It is also a bit bigger than expected and I realized it more when someone asked me about it and also commented on its size. The Versa 2 is a great idea that was poorly executed.",2
1,"What an awesome product!! I upgraded from the FitBit Charge 2 to the Versa 2, and I was extremely satisfied with the product.There is a slight learning curve becuase the Versa 2 is quite high tech, and the ‘upgrade’ and syncing the new FitBit to the app took about 45 minutes.Nevertheless, the Versa 2 is incredible!! I love the Alexa feature, the wallet feature, and all the fantastic FitBit features like sleep tracking and exercise features. The band it comes with is super comfortable, and hasn’t caused any skin irritations (but I take mine off to charge everyday, disinfect the bands, and leave it off for at least an hour). Keep in mind before I bought the Versa 2, I was already fluent with FitBit products.If you have fitbit products and are considering upgrading, upgrade to the Versa 2. You won’t be sorry!!",5
0,"I'm so angry about this purchase. The watch is basically just a step tracker and weak heart rate monitor. You only get all the programs it advertises if your willing to pay the $10/month Premium subscription. None of the Workouts, Mindfulness programs, etc are available without the subscription. SHAME ON FITBITUnless you are willing to pay an additional $10/month extra, you might as well pay for a much less expensive watch, and there are plenty of those available. I plan to return my watch.",1
1,"They really need to change their setup. It was a pain keeping it connected. Had to reboot the watch and phone SEVERAL times to get the update to get it online. I haven't used all the features yet, but so far the workout function for tracking is EXCELLENT!!!Overall, i'm glad I made the purchase just a painful setup...",4

1,"This is my first smart phone so I can’t compare it to anything, but I am very happy with my purchase. I bought it because I got into running almost a year ago and I found that it really helps my training. I use it to track my progress in pace, time, and distance. I run on hilly routes so I was happy that it also tracks elevation. I also like the heart rate monitor. The GPS seems accurate for distance. I used my Fitbit for a 10k and a half marathon along with another app that I was required to use and both measured the same distance. The heart rate monitor seems comparable to a treadmill that I used in the past before I started to run on the road. I don’t use the watch while sleeping because I don’t like to wear it went trying to sleep. Overall it does a good job for what I bought it for and I am happy with my purchase.",5
0,"I've had this for about a week and I am still struggling with connecting it all to be fully functional. Undecided whether or not I'm going to return it. I've spent at least 3 hours getting this thing set up and I still can't get music on it (personal or spotify). I've spent an unreasonable amount of time googling how to get things to work right on it and I'm usually pretty good with technology. Not user friendly at all. If you are going to buy it, do it on a day where you can dedicate half the day setting it up.",2
0,"This was my first smart watch and liked the features it offered. The big downside was when I ran the same route, approximately 4 miles, I would get different distances covered, sometimes more, sometimes less, off by as much as 1/8 mile. After 10 months, the screen went black and it took numerous hours to get it back up and running following numerous suggestion. then about a month later, the screen would become scrambled, but always cleared up after some time. At that point I should have contacted Fitbit to return, but didn't, and about 6 weeks later it wouldn't charge. I followed all the instructions to no avail. I contacted Fitbit and they said it was out of warranty but gave me a 35% discount on a new Versa 2, but could not be used for Versa 3 or Sense. In my opinion, poor customer service and it should be for any of their products. Do I want another Versa 2 that died after 14 months? UGH",2
1,"I wear this almost every single day. It tracks your sleep very well unless you lay in bed completely still for a while after you wake up it thinks you are sleeping (which is probably for obvious reasons.) It tracks your heart rate amazingly well and there are lots of different faces you can get on it. I track mostly my steps, calories burnt, heart rate, activity minutes, and sleep. All of them can be found on your watch except the sleep, which you can just open the app and see.",5
0,"The watch quit working within 5 months. I went through the warranty claim process and received a new watch. 5 months later, the watch quit working again. I am now going through the warranty process again with the possibility of not receiving a replacement, as they have lost my watch even though it was delivered to the return agent. Customer service is horrible and the watch is a piece of crap. BUY A DIFFERENT BRAND!",1
0,"I have been a loyal Fitbit user for a while, and overall enjoy the functionality of the Versa 2. I've had my Versa 2 for about 9 months and recently the band started getting loose. Before I could recognize it as a real problem, it broke off my wrist while I was walking in my neighborhood and it was too late before I realized it.Due to the issues with the wristband, I consider this a damaged product & covered under the warranty for defects in the material or workmanship. After speaking with CS they told me that if I reported the issues *before* it broke off my wrist it would've been considered damaged, but since it ultimately fell off and could not be found it is considered lost - which conveniently does not fall under the warranty. In the new Versa 3 they've actually re-designed the band to make it less likely to break off too.If you don't want to be forced to buy a new product for a couple hundred dollars every few months, I recommend spending a bit more up front for a product that will last & company that won't screw you in the warranty policy. After 5 years as a loyal Fitbit user I'll be looking into another smartwatch brand.",2
1,I seriously feel like this is a game changer… I discovered adventure walks and discovery challenges it really keep me motivated… the food tracker has everything in it including 3 meal and 3 snack sections it breaks down everything into sections so you can see if your where u need to be. There are so many features I can’t begin to tell you… Just buy one and u will see!!!!!Someone gave a lot of thought to creating this product!As far as any negative… Why did I wait so long to buy one,5
0,"Loved it at first but then the problems started. The synchronization was off, then the screen touch wouldnt work then the button would not respond. I've reached out to fitbit but all they do is give me the run around. All I asked for was to fix it. They wont do it. I keep doing the reset over and over and still had problems with it. Do not buy this product until they fix all the crap wrong with it first.",1
0,"The fitbit versa 2 is an okay item. I honestly wanted to try it since I owned a fitbit charge 2. I was under the impression it was an upgrade. It clearly is not. Yes you can control spotify and pandora music apps from your wrist, but only on a premium membership purchase. The fitbit versa 2 does not have its own speaker to listen to the music. Basically you are paying for the newest but yet has only one difference the touch screen is color. The notifications are the same as the fitbit charge 2..just with a color screen. This is a conplete let down.",1

It’s stylish, charges fast, works really well, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who just wants to learn more about their bodies.",5
0,"Do not buy this watch unless you want to spend the extra money for the extended warranty or service plan. Otherwise buy it directly from Fitbit so it is automatically under warranty for 1-year. I bought mine in January and about three months later it won't pair with my phone, the Fitbit app or any of my exercise apps. There's not a thing I can do about it. It's now just junk. Expensive junk!",1
0,"I had a Charge 3 for a year and was very happy with it. I decided to update to the Versa 2 because I wanted something I could listen to media with, in particular while swimming. From the product description, this appeared to be something this device could do. Alas, the optimistic product description belies some pretty huge limitations.Firstly, there are serious limitations on what media you can put on the watch. The product description says you can ""control spotify, download Pandora stations and add Deezer playlists"". The devil is in the details here - firstly, you can't download any of your Spotify content to the watch itself, so you'll need to have your phone with you if you want to listen via Spotify. It's just a glorified remote control for Spotify. For Pandora you only get 'stations' - playlists pre-made by Pandora which, for the most part, aren't very good. Deezer is the best - at least you can make your own playlists - but whenever I hit the 'play' button on the watch, the only thing that happens is it disconnects my speakers (I've tried several speakers). So, too buggy to use, at least for me.Secondly, note that there's no podcast support. Neither Pandora stations nor Deezer playlists can contain podcasts. So you either have to download playlists and upload them manually via the FitBit Connect app, or you have no podcasts. Just music.Finally - the FitBit Connect app is not available for Linux users. Come on Fitbit, I know we're a minority but we're not that uncommon amongst the upwardly-mobile 30-somethings who probably make up your core demographic. So if you're a Linux user, you'll be stuck with Pandora and Deezer which, as I've explained above, don't seem to work - at least not very well.Given that the ability to play media seems to be the major advantage over the Charge (the contactless payment on your wrist is cool I guess, but not that many retailers accept contactless payment anyway), one wonders how FitBit justifies offering this dubious 'upgrade'.",2
0,"This was the replacement for the first Versa 2 which completely failed to connect to any network/bluetooth.This worked ok (never great) but it started loading playlists that did not exist and generated errors.We factory reset the watch, the lists came back. Uninstalled the app, reset the watch again and now it won't get past the startup logo.Waste of Money.Fitbit's support articles are a joke. They frequently tell you to push both of the buttons on the Versa 2.. which only has ONE BUTTON.The steps they provide for support are always the same. Reboot. Factory Reset. Wash...rinse... repeat.I can't count how many forum posts end with ""and they sent me a replacement"".I regret getting this watch for my wife and will not be buying any future FitBit devices.",1
1,"Connectivity problems with headphones,will not find any of my headphones. I tried removing headphone connection to my other devices and then tried to have versa 2 connect to headphones and no such luck. Versa 2 wanted to constantly connect to my smart tv but never found blue tooth head phones. When at fitness facilitytried to have versa find headphones and still not able to connect. Only way to listen to music is if headphones are connect to my phone. I was hoping to not have to carry my phone around when walking or working out. If you have Fitbit app on your phone and other devices you can not keep connected to all it will only connect to one. I had to remove Fitbit versa 2 from all other devices and only keep it on my phone and was able to keep it connected.I do like the watch and how easy it is to swipe thru on the screen. Battery is long lasting. I like the fact that it is waterproof. The exercise app is great,you can go thru each exercise and track your activity. I do not use the sleep,the watch is bulky to sleep with,I never slept with my other Fitbits. Do not get the covers that fit over the face they do not fit correctly. I bought the face shields to protect face from scratches and returned the plastic covers.",4

 Like the title alluded to this is two reviews in one. I will review the product itself, Versa 2 watch, and Fitbit as a company.First the watch. Versa 2 is all in all great fitness watch. For the price, there are some compromises but if you’re aware of it, it can be a great value. For me, all I want is to exercise/run/lift with my music (mp3 and aac) and have the ability to track my heart rate zone during the activities and not cost over $200. I don’t really want or care about sleep tracking, 24/7 heart rate tracking, GPS mapping, text notifications, streaming services, etc. I’ve inherited few analog watches that I rather wear on a daily basis. And I really don’t see the point of some of the features of a smart watch when my phone is nearby. So if you’re thinking that my needs are simple and it can be easily fulfilled. You will be wrong. Shocking wrong. Most watches can’t store music or cost over $400. This watch is one of the very few that can. So I was very excited for this watch.Setup was simple enough on the iPhone but uploading music is a very cumbersome process. You can’t upload music from your phone to the watch, you have to do it from a Windows PC or Mac. While the watch communicates with the phone over Bluetooth, music uploading is done over WiFi. But the WiFi is not turned on automatically, you’ll have to initiate the process from both the watch and PC. Also you can’t download music directly from the streaming services such as Pandora or Spotify to the watch, the watch apps are just to control the services on the phone only.Thus a big compromise emerges. It requires your phone to do all the “cool” stuff you want. Stream music on Pandora/Spotify/Deezer, Strava GPS mapping, Alexa voice command, etc. It all needs a phone nearby. For me, I don’t want to carry my phone during my activities and if I did, wearing a watch is pointless and redundant. So a lot of these services I can’t use. If you understand this compromise, this watch can be great for you.Sadly I only had my watch less than an hour before it inexplicably started to freak out by flashing the Fitbit logo on and off (see the video). By perusing their community forums for answers, not only did I found out that this is a common error but it can be fixed by doing a hard reset. Hard reset basically resets it to factory settings and you have to setup the watch all over again. Which can be a 10-15 min process. Now a pattern emerges, after setting my watch anew, the logo flashing behavior will rear its ugly head after few hours. After a few more cycles of this madness and when it couldn't even be revived any more, I contacted Fitbit support.Thus my second part of the review. The Fitbit company and its policies. They were very responsive to both Twitter DMs and emails and they seemed eager to help. But their policies have a lot to be desired. It’s very clear that my watch was defective from the factory and all I wanted was a new retail replacement. But they sent me a refurbished watch face only (see the image). While I have a working watch, I felt like I paid full retail for a refurbished watch and that didn’t sit right with me. After a week of trading emails communicating my desire for a new retail replacement, they wouldn’t budge and hid behind their policy. I would’ve been fine with the replacement if my watch was 3 months old. But it was broke from the start.. Funny thing is that any big box retailer would have traded it for another without any questions but Fitbit directly flat out refused to do so. I thought of keeping it but it bugs me that Fitbit is acting this way. It’s kind of petty but I’ll not let Fitbit win. So I’ll be returning my watch.3 stars for the watch, 1 star for the company’s behavior. So two stars from me.",2
1,"The face on my Apple watch shattered and it was going to cost almost as much as a new one to get the face replaced so I decided to go back with FitBit. Best decision ever! I feel the FitBit does a better job of tracking my steps/heart rate/etc over the Apple Watch. Even better, a single charge lasts for DAYS whereas the Apple Watch had to be charged nightly. I'm very happy with this purchase and would highly recommend it over the competition.",5

 Purchased in April 2021. Worked great for 9 months - used it for half marathon training and keeping track of workouts, was very happy with it until this morning, when all it will do is this flashing white screen. My best guess is that the 'waterproof seal' wore out. I never wear it in the shower or to swim, so the moisture would just be from sweat during workouts. Too expensive for only 9 months of use!",1

It was charged and just died, I don't know why I keep buying these this is the 2nd one to just up and die and customer service not good, they can't help me unless I reset and they can see data, can reset a dead piece of crap, this is a different version compared to the last one but I'm done, I would not recommend this at all or any other fitbit product.",1
0,I am using my second Fitbit Versa 2 and once again it did not hold up in the water. It has a swim mode and I swim laps and my Fitbit ended up first losing the ability to monitor heart rate and then a week later completely died. I am not happy about that. I have given up on the fitbit being able to handle my adventures. It didn't make it.,2
1,The versa 2 is comfortable to wear and the purple and rose gold color looks very good. I like how it tracks my sleep accurately and is able to play my Spotify music. The only problem I have is that I have to take it off when I am doing stuff like typing on my computer or sewing because it counts my arm moving as steps even though I'm sitting down lol.,5
1,"I love my new Fitbit Versa. My Versa lite had stopped tracking heart rate, so it stopped tracking sleep, mindfulness and cardio fitness. I love the voice response to texts, clock face changes. The only drawback is that it doesn't have a longer battery life than the Versa lite. It lasts about 4 days depending on if you use the constant display. I have had a Fitbit since 2015.",5
1,"For the price, it's a good buy. The only thing I don't like which is actually major is you have to keep the Fitbit app running on your phone at all times to get full functionality of apps such as Alexa.Other than that, it works great. Another not so nice thing is you can't broadcast your HR to devices such as a bike computer or 3rd party apps.I had to buy a HR chest strap for that so I no longer need my watch for working out.",4
1,"Great device... Very well laid out and designed. Step up from the Samsung Galaxy watch from the prospective of accurate sleep tracking. Battery life is amazing... Don't assume this thing is like a Samsung watch or other Android watches. It is truly nothing like one at all. The UI is clunky. It doesn't feel like a device designed for a hard core smart watch nerd. But where this device is totally separate from others is in its exercise tracking. There is one huge flaw and reason why I gave this a 3 star review. Step tracking is not accurate even with specification of hand. Instead this device has the tendency to track steps by simple wrist movements. Other features like heart rate or other forms of exercise are tracked well ... A bit disappointing they can't filter out these unwanted steps.I'd suggest you buy this if you want more accurate sleep tracking, heart rate and superb battery life with 80/85% accuracy on step counting. This metric was compared against SAMSUNG Galaxy Gear 3, and 2.",3
0,"The device is beautiful, the sleep tracking is great, the app is very user friendly, the heart rate monitor and calorie tracking is nearly useless. It overestimates your calorie burn by thousands if you're an active adult, and worst of all it's a fitness tracker that doesn't track correctly when you're sweaty. What's the point?I was doing high intensity cardio to the point I could barely breath and the heart rate on this thing was showing 60BPM. A quick check on the arc trainer showed 150 which made more sense as I was out of breath. I had read in other reviews that it would dip down sometimes but this was for a solid 30 minutes of the workout. I figured it was malfunctioning until I did a Google search and found it was a common issue... Sent it back within 3 days of receiving it.",2
0,"I've had mine for about a year and wish I wouldn't have purchase it. It's useless for listening to music unless you feel like shelling out more money for premium music services.

It's fully charged and I did not drop it even once. It's just stopped working one day. Press and Hold the button for 10 seconds DO NOT WORK. It's a dead device now. Money wasted. Very upset.",1
1,The watch came well packaged and with enough charge to get it set up and going for the day. I love the color and the screen displays very clear. The band is also very comfortable and I’m sensitive to everything. I used our heart rate and oxygen monitor to compare the heart rate and it’s very accurate in that respect. The sleep was slightly off and had my bed time as sooner but I also normally have a low resting heart rate and don’t do much before I actually go to bed.,5
1,Trying to change the watch bands is absolutely ridiculous! I have broken three nails and one watch band trying to change it! I was debating on which kind of smartwatch to get. I've not had much luck with Fitbits they seemed only last me a year. But I decided to try it one more time and I got the versa 2. it is virtually impossible to change the watch bands and if you look online that's all everybody complains about is it is impossible to change the watch bands. You need to work on that. Believe it or not I don't think I'll ever buy another one mostly because of that,3
0,"This watch is very appealing on the wrist! Love the touch screen and the ease of use. But every time I use it on my run the distance tracked it completely off!! I bought this watch solely to track my runs, distance and time; it is very disappointing that I cannot do that. I do run with my phone for the location as the FitBit needs to connect to it for location tracker, but over half of the run the watch says ""connecting"" and stops tracking. It is so disappointing that cant use this watch for the purpose I purchased it for.",2
0,"10 months, that is the life of this device. My heart rate monitor got stuck. Factory reset the device and repaired it to the app. Fixed it for about 5 minutes then got stuck again.Fitbit replaced it with another broken device.This device would not sync steps from my versa 2 to my app. Two devices in less than a year. Not worth this money. Now im fighting with them to send me a new device but they wont send me a new device without send my old device back? you can see why im uncomfortable sending them anything if they have failed twice. Buy a GARMIN instead.",1
1,"I had got this because my mother really wanted a smartwatch, but I didn't want to spend a large amount of money on one when most of it would go unused. I think if you can get this at the price I did (120), then this is probably the best bang for your buck you can get. I see the versa 3 is out now though and that does have google assistant instead of alexa, so I would recommend that over this one any day",5

1,At first I was so excited to get this watch. I had the Alta a few years ago and loved it. Then I got this one. I prefer the Alta. Simply because it really seems like you’re paying way more than what this device is actually worth and you can get the same features on cheaper smart watches.,3

0,I’ve thus “lite” version and this kinda! I’ve had to get him total 4 watches places because the face/screen on the watch literally pops off. I’ve always wondered if other people have had this same problem cause there’s no way I’m the only one! It’s ridiculous. I love the app and al the features but the watch it’s self is just a waste of money at this point. They don’t last a year! Luckily I have been able to get them replaced under warranty but the one that’s being sent to me now is my last Fitbit!,1
1,Nice large screen with an intuitive interface. Very long battery life. Accurate tracking of sleep and heart rate. I really wish the app supported Audible and wonder why it is taking Fitbit so long to activate its SpO2 sensor to track sleep apnea.,5
0,"Watch has not worked properly since purchase, contacted Fitbit and after 45 minutes determined that they could not help and that they would send a replacement. Product was 6 months old and I had purchased the extended warranty of 2 additional years. They made me send it back first and I did not receive the replacement for another month (no credit to the warranty and would not just credit it back to my account). The replacement would not load correctly, contacted them once again and the agent told me to read the directions. I explained that I had and they proceeded to tell me that they could not help. I asked to speak with a manager and the agent told me that I would get an email.The customer support is horrible. I have been a customer for years and will never purchase another product from them again.",1
0,"No direct phone interface. Does not play music unless you pay for a service supported with a watch app and you pair BT to watch--as in, if I want to pair my headset, now I cannot use that to take calls b/c paired to watch, not phone.No texts or phone notifications.No Android Pay. Fitbit Pay works at Target but not at Fred Meyer, not at Starbucks, not at fast food. The technology is supported, but the commercial billing side isn't. No regional banks or C/Us supported either, but they do take American Express. All told, I was using it as a watch that told me how long I slept--but also only if I manually switched on Sleep Mode and unlocked the watch first thing. Otherwise in the bathroom, I was considered in ""light sleep.""",2
1,"After one week it seems to work just as advertised. I'm very pleased with it overall. Great to track my activities with the long battery watch I don't find myself constantly looking at the battery meter.The only qwirk I found cones when there are software updates. It seems to take much longer to push updates from the phone to help watch than it does other bluetooth devices. Could be data size. But it took about 1-1.5hrs to update when I first got it.Update 02-Jan-2022: Two years later, this device is still going strong. At 1 year, I splurged and bought about 8 watch bands from a few 3rd party vendors, the bands made of varying materials (i.e. metal, cloth, rubber, wood, leather) and colors. This was a nice upgrade and I now wear the Versa2 as my primary watch and it works for most occasions just by switching out the bands.",5
1,"It is a beautiful watch but there is something wrong with it. It does not hold a charge. I have to charge it every day. I only use it for steps and time. No music or apps. I bought two of these, one for my daughter and one for myself. She has to charge hers everyday as well. The last watch, which was a Fitbit watch kept a charge for a week. So tell me why I go from a weeks charge to charging every day?",3
0,"I really like the features; however, this is my second Versa that has died. The first one, I foolishly believed the manuel that I could go swimming with it since it tracks swimming! Nope, not completely waterproof.Now this second one has died for no apparent reason. The screen became static so I held the button down to restart it mutiple times, then left it on the charger for two days and it came back to life ( it had plenty of charge when this started).So a week later the screen turned white and now has completely died. Needless to say I won't be wasting my money again.",1
1,My wife has been using the Fitbit Versa for a few weeks now. Overall she likes it but there are a few issues. 1. You can stream music from your watch but you need to have a subscription to Spotify or Pandora. We have a subscription to Amazon Music but that doesn’t work with the watch. 2. The screen is supposed to come on with movement or when you touch it. That feature only works half the time. 3. The pay feature only works with certain banks and certain locations. These are all features that Fitbit highlights but there are lots of caveats.,3
1,"I do not like how the fitbit connects/interacts with MyFitnessPal. My fitness watch prior did not give me as many issues. The watch will do and the app is tolerable. Not what I was hoping for. The app seems to have more ""extras"" than some of the basics or even filter options I'd like.Example, my workouts completed. I would like to be able to edit them. (For example treadmill runs with inaccurate distance) I'd also love if I could sort them/filter them by type to compare and see my progress. I'd like to clearly see calories burned during the exercise.",4
0,"This device stopped working after 91 days of use. The device screen would not turn on after attempting restart, after full charging, after syncing. I contacting Fitbit support and they could do nothing to fix it and I have to ship it to them. I want a refund and not a return but they only support refund up to 45 days. I'm afraid to have it replaced as this may happen again I am guessing which is very sad. I enjoyed using this for sleep tracking and activity tracking, but I have to consider a device from another company. Buyer beware!",1
1,I am SO happy with the Fitbit Versa 2! I know I’ve only had it awhile but it is exactly what I wanted it for: activity and health and fitness. Perfect for that and perfect price!! The amazing thing on the watch is how light it feels! I read that from someone’s review and it’s true! All of the faces are pretty large for my small wrist but I’m used to that now and it’s smaller than some. All Roy d perfect for me! Very happy! I’ve had a Fitbit years ago and I’m still happy with them,5
1,"Got this for my girlfriend to help her track and manage her anxiety. Between the heart rate monitor and built-in breathing/relaxing exercises, she says it has been a huge help and has enabled her to see when she is becoming anxious before she even realizes it and helps her to calm herself down. Lastly, it makes her more excited to work out because she likes seeing/tracking her progress. Definitely a great purchase!",5
1,I got this in the rose gold color and it is really nice. It is not too big. I love the color. It has been easy to use. I don’t have a big desire to use all the functions so I am happy with the simple things I got it for. Steps. Heartbeat. Calories. Etc. The Fitbit app works great. It does motivate me to see those steps and want to get them up. Not always ha ha. Everyone has to have a couch day once in a while.,5
0,"My account was hacked into well over 3 weeks ago and the hacker changed my email address on my account. Since my email address was changed, I have been unable to log into the fitbit app. I contacted Fitbit support and they have provided no resolution. Every time I call (at least 4 times now) and provide the case number, they simply state that it has been escalated to the security team and they will contact me. I asked to speak to the security team and they say that is not possible. I also spoke to a supervisor who provided the same feedback and was extremely rude to me. On my latest call I asked if it was possible for me to return the product at this point since I haven't been able to access my data for weeks..... Fitbit said since I purchased my versa on Amazon, they are unable to process any type of refund. What is the point of having a fitbit if i cannot access the app? esp when I am paying for premium features!My girlfriend has also had recent problems with her fitbit and provided similar feedback - unacceptable customer service. Her fitbit had a huge white line going down the center of the screen & literally melted while on the charger.Do yourself a favor & skip Fitbit. I am going to pay the extra cash for an apple watch.",1
1,I found this very hard to use. Watched you tube to try to figure it out. I’m 65 so I had my daughter who is “techy “ help me. She worked on it and finally said I should just get an Apple Watch. So I traded it. So much easier!!!! I got a version 3 so it wasn’t much more than the Fitbit.,3
0,"this has been my daily watch, and the band just fell apart. Watch features are okay, but watch itself is just not that durable. I am 55 years old, do nothing strenuous and the band came apart today.will be calling to see if it is under warranty, but this watch is just not well made.Would not recommend. Will look at a garmin for the future-much better made watch.",1
1,You can't go wrong with a Fitbit. They are consistently voted number one in fitness trackers for accuracy. Over the years I have upgraded my tracker to the latest technology and have never been disappointed. I really like the Versa 2 because it can get wet and keep working. You can download your Itunes to it and have one les device to carry. You can spend hundred more or other smart watches but they aren't any better.,5
1,I've had the moto360 and Pebble. When Fitbit bought and abandoned Pebble I had written them off. Well after a year or so of missing having a smart watch and hacking my old Pebble to work again I got the versa after seeing my wife enjoy her charge 3. I wish I had bought this sooner. This is everything I need in a smart watch and most of the things I want. The health tracking is too notch and really motivates me. The sleep tracking is fascinating and is getting me to try to get better sleep. Notifications are helpful and the battery life is amazing!,5
1,"Microphone stopped working just before 2 yrs of ownership... other than that, was a great smart watch. Fitbit says non repairable part. Says to replace. Sucks since everything else on watch is fine. A working microphone is important, but not sure I want to pay $200 - $300 for what is basically a microphone repair / replacement",4
0,"I've owned this watch for a year and a half. It's been glitchy the entire time I've had it - wouldn't synch without restarting watch or removing and pairing as new device every other day, loses Alexa settings, dies for no reason, and now the battery drains literally in 10 minutes and, oh cool, I can't replace the battery! I've owned four fitbit devices / watches since they came out, and I guess I'm moving to apple now. When I spend over $200 on a watch, I expect it to do what it claims and to last more than 1.5 years. Very disappointed with this garbage watch.",1
1,"I was very disappointed to find I can't download the fitbit app of a MacBook -- only an iPhone or an iPad, an android phone or a windows computer. The information on the website was incorrect. Not everyone lives glued to a smart phone, me included!!! It took two long support calls to even figure that out.",3
1,"I have been wearing my Versa for a few years. He has gone back & forth about wanting to wear a watch or Fitbit all day at work (he works in HVAC & doesn't like having much jewelry in his way). Overall, he loves to wear this, pretty much has it on all the time if it's not charging. It's a great, easy to wear, much more reasonably priced AppleWatch or fancy smartwatch. It does everything you need without the price, has a ton of color/band options, and lasts at least two days on battery power.",5
1,Up until the heat came was working fine! Today I started out with 65% life then all of a sudden it died. So was good with it up until the last couple of weeks. Use to have battery life up to 5 days now I’m good to make 2,5
0,"I really like all the features that this watch has to offer. I feel like it tracks better than previous fitbit watches. However, sometimes I do have issues with syncing with the app. I also wish that the coaching came with the app instead of paying an additional $79/year.Update: it’s 11/27 and I ordered this on 12/2. It is no longer charging. At least it had the decency to stop working before the warranty ran out this time! Save the money and upgrade to an apple. I know I will.",1
1,"I bought it for my husband, and this is what he said:""As long as you want to exercise and get up when it tells you to, it is perfect.All in App needs subscription. Not cool!All I use it for is as a reminder to get up and walk, and every once in a while I look at the heart rate. Not sure if it is accurate. Just so you know, moving your arms counts as a step... LOL""So, I was thinking about buying me one but I`ve decided not to.",4
0,"Just bought the watch and was wondering why it wasn't tracking my heart rate. I had been wearing it on my left arm all day with no results and the rate was only tracked when I moved it practically to my hand, over my wrist bones. So I eventually tried it on my right arm and it worked immediately. Apparently it doesn't work through tattoos (my left arm is almost entirely black). Be warned!Update: I've had the watch for a few days and have taken it on some runs now. I have to say I'm very dissatisfied. The mileage is way off (for a nine mile run it got 6.5). I will be requesting a refund.",1

0,"Less than 4 months after first use, and it will not take a charge; gets dangerously hot . And of course, it never recorded sleep stats correctly. This is the second Fitbit device we have purchased and will never buy another.The first one was a constant pain in the @$$ - wouldn't connect to phone, or wouldn't record stats. Every day was a craps shoot on whether it would work. Multiple calls to Fitbit with no resolution. 21 months after purchase and the face when dead (no interface) and wouldn't take a charge.I took a real chance getting this ""upgraded"" device, hoping it would work better. This one is even worse. If anyone is considering this or any model of Fitbit - buyer beware. You are probably throwing your money away.",1

The touch screen quits working after a few months, and my first replacement quit working with the touch, then spent a week flashing bright white screen then totally died.

I liked the features but so disappointed that first two lasted about 4 months each.",1
1,"I like the watch so far, had it a day. Decided I might need the longer band and went to switch it out. I did not expect it to be like a traditional watch band. I can't seem to be able to get the pin held in while pushing the large rubber end in. Why did they change how they connect the bands for the Charge 3 and then for the Versa they decide lets go old school.",4
0,"Down the drain in less than one year. Really bad since while it worked I liked it.It started with functions no longer working. Music, screen controls, then sync and now nothing but the main screen, seems to respond. It won't even adjust the brightness and dim isn't good for me, unless it's dark.While it lasted it was fine, but I'm not paying for a new one every year.Off to check out the competition.",1
1,This is 3 times better than the charge 2. I have no problems with it tracking heart rate while exercising and all steps are real time and not hundreds off and would still go up after I finish my walk. I also love the touchscreen and the Alexa part. This to me does everything I need it to do.,5
1,"The app took a little bit of getting used too, and I’m sure I haven’t fully checked out all the features it provides, but now that I know what I’m doing I really love it. The Fitbit versa is a great tool to aid in getting healthier and losing weight! I’m tracking calories for weight loss, and I love having an accurate description of how many calories I burn through-out the day! Even when I’m just doing homework or at work. I also love seeing how my heart rate fluctuates while working out or just taking a walk, I have a better understanding of where my health is at. I struggled between buying this and not an Apple Watch, but I wasn’t interested in having a second phone on my wrist, I just wanted a tool to help track my activity and Fitbit is PERFECT for that!",5

Apparently, the fitbit company shopped their customer service to the lowest bidder. Very disappointing.",1
0,"The Versa 2 was not what I expected. There is no output for Alexa, emails, text, or music. You basically have to use thre app on your phone for much of the features, if you can get them to work. Emails never would open so you can't read them - what's the point? You have to either download music to your Versa 2, or use a premium music service (spotify), and then use ear pods via bluetooth to listen. Too much work.Heartrate and steps work.",2
0,"I loved this fitbit out of the box. For the first few days I was able to receive text messages from my phone. Then all of a sudden they stopped. After 2 chats with fitbit, they admitted it's a known issue and don't know when or if it will be fixed. On their help page it states there is an issue with iPhones, but now it's also galaxy 10's. I wish I had read the help pages earlier and seen that it's a common issue and most people aren't able to get it fixed. Too bad because it's very user friendly, and good looking for the price. Unfortunately, I need to be able to get my messages on my watch so it had to go back and I switched to a Garmin. Haven't had any problems with that one!",1
0,"I love the watch, but after 3 months of having it, the screen only activates about 50% of the time when I push the button on the side or tap it, and when it DOES light up, the touch screen features only work about 25% of the time.

I'm super disappointed cause I just want it to work :(",2
1,"Not the best for a smart watch but does what I need it too. I don't think the step counting is really reliable in all honesty and it's a little annoying they have that nice big watch face but only use a portion of it. I'm giving this product a solid 4 stars though because I washed and dried it on accident the other day. Came out with no scratches, heat or water damage. So that's pretty cool.",4
0,"I purchased this because the website said it was compatible with my phone. Worked for 3 months and all of a sudden it got disconnected or ""wouldn't sync"" read things online to try and fix it. Nothing worked. Called Fitbits customer service and they literally told me everything I tried to get it to re-sync. Then when it didn't work they told me, ""Sorry there's nothing more we can do for you."" What kind of customer service is this?! You tell me on the website my phone is compatible and now I can't be helped, because it won't connect anymore?? Can't even return it for my money or nothing? Just sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't... GREAT customer service.... (sarcasm) and false advertising in my eyes.... terrible customer service, terrible company, terrible product. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM, OR ANY OTHER FITBIT PRODUCT!!!!!",1

The fb groups for Fitbit have shown me various cool watch faces. I currently have a customized photo from my wedding on my face. Considering I have the notifications on the majority of the day , I feel that my battery life is fantastic. I only charge while I’m in the shower and that’s enough for me. The silicone straps that come with the watch can be a little irritating but just make sure to clean it and it doesn’t cause too much of an issue. I am however looking into getting different ones.",5
1,"After buying a cheaper type of fitness tracker on Amazon and absolutely hated it, I decided to treat myself and go with a fit bit. I absolutely love it for tracking my steps, water and calories. It really motivates me to watch what I eat, keep drinking water, and keep moving. I wouldn’t suggest buying anything other than a fit bit. It keeps at least a 4 day charge and when you do need to charge it, it charges quickly!!",5
1,"The Versa 2 fits my small wrist very well with the small band. Pros: Easy set up. Nice charger. Paired well. Alexa integration. Water resistant. Long battery life. Heart rate monitor and sleep metrics. Flappy Bird app (cute and fun). Bitmoji watch face that changes throughout the day. Cons: no sound at all comes from the watch without ear buds. Very strange. No ability to reply to text at all or even “quick reply“ with presets. The quick reply is android only. Cheers and taunts on the leaderboard only go through on the app not watch to watch. Awkward music connection as songs must be preloaded through the computer. I wanted to love this watch, but I find I just “like it a lot”.",4
1,"I was nervous at first before ordering this because I notice some people were saying they were having issues connecting to a note 8. I called best buy to double check and they said it should connect no problem, so I went ahead and ordered. I'm very happy I did!! It took me about 10 minutes and then everything was connected without a problem!!! I use Alexa daily and love being able to track my steps. The clock faces are very cute. The strap it came with rubbed my skin and irritated it but luckily I ordered a few different ones and that solved that issue.",5

Given the price it should have been more accurate, and it should not have gone into an unrepairable loop 14 months after buying it new. Very unhappy.",1
0,"Had it for a little over a year. The original band it came with gave ma a rash. System rendered it useless for a few weeks.

I wanted a watch that could stream Pandora so I wouldn't have to run with my phone and this watch fit the bill, unfortunately the watch doesn't have built in GPS so if you want to map your run you need your phone anyway.Speaking of mapping the watch is supposed be able to upload to Strava, but after two weeks and several activities I was never able to successfully map a single activity. The watch needs to use your phones GPS, but if it loses connection during an activity it won't reconnect until the activity is over. It lost connection on every activity I did. I gave up and returned it.",2
1,"Caught the Fitbit Versa 2 on sale and thought I would give it a try. This thing works GREAT. Does far more than I will probably ever be able to use it for. The fitness tracking is really solid as is the sleep monitoring. And having it synced to my smart phone so I can see who is texting / calling without pulling out my phone is great. It has GPS tracking (synced with the phone), and having my tunes stored on the watch is great also (has Bluetooth for pairing with headphones / earbuds). Battery life is good (around 5+ days depending on what you are doing and how many alerts you have enabled). Very configurable as to what it does automatically. Great value.",5

1,Loved my original one until it quit working. This is my replacement and it's now caused burns and freezes and does not give all emails and loses connecting with Bluetooth multiple times a day. This one is worse than the original. Fixing to send off for another one. Only down side is price I paid a few months ago is more than what it is charging now. So I lose money on this one just like the last one.,3
0,"Great smart watch. Feature rich. Beautiful always on display. Unreliable heart rate monitor.If you have wrist tattoos, try at your own risk or you might want to seriously consider an alternative.Spoke to Fitbit directly after explaining to them that my Fitbit inspire HR reads my heart rate perfectly, but their best response was to find an alternative. They said that the Versa 2’s sensor is more “sensitive” in comparison to my Inspire HR!I gave it 1 star rating because the lack of reliable Heart rate functionality ultimately rendered this great watch useless for me. I would’ve Rated it 5 stars otherwise. However, if you have “naked” tattoo free wrists then you should have a pretty seamless experience.What did I do with the watch? I decided to gift it to my cousin for Christmas instead of getting a refund. He hasn’t has any problems so far.",1

I'll have to replace the band I guess with something not from Fitbit.",3
0,Not very happy with this new watch - I loved my Blaze and probably should have just changed the battery but is wasn’t and easy process. This Versa 2 does not record accurate steps or miles. It is off on my treadmill by almost a mile every time and is off by 3/4 from my friends Apple Watch. I almost want to send it back but then I don’t want to spend the amount on the Apple Watch either - UGH!!! Not happy with this purchase - bring back the Blaze!!!!,2
1,"My biggest knock against this product? The screen takes on scratches TOO easily! I thought this product - being a fitness tracker - could take minor abuse. WRONG. Within DAYS of receiving this product, there were numerous scratches to the screen after a a kickboxing class. I assume wearing the gloves did the scratches. Other than the screen's weakness, the watch itself is fine. However, I have a scratched up watch face. Fitbit refused to switch out the device.",3
0,"I have been waiting years for something that integrated Android, Spotify, and Fitbit. I dropped all the money on this thing. I find the fitbit parts acceptable, but I SHOULD have stayed with my perfectly equal Flex until I read some reviews, maybe even waited for a few more iterations.Spotify connectivity has to be manually forced through the apps on your phone, and that connectivity lasts exactly 51 minutes. And by the way, its just a remote control for Spotify. I have a no-name thing that cost $3 that does skip song AND volume!What is the WORST PART is I have been loyal to fitbit for years and years - I credit them in my success in losing over 150 lbs, and their customer service was the BEST. Once upon a time, I lost mine and they sent me a replacement free! Now as I look sadly through the Support forum, their reps are more concerned with explaining netiquette than ever answering the question. Also, I had to jump through hoops to post this review - Amazon says there is an unusual amount, at this time. Well, yes, maybe cause we are all very disappointed - I have waited on an update or something since the day I got it (in like. November...)",1
1,"I bought it and used it for about three days. And I'm returning it today. The apps don't actually work as well (like Spotify) because there is a huge delay and you still need to have your phone on you to do what you want to do. There have been syncing issues with my Samsung (trouble connecting to Bluetooth) nearly every day I used it. I didn't really find that the apps were working well enough to be utilized. Alexa does not appear to respond to my voice so you have to open up the app and then press the button to use Alexa. You are able to use music on it but again you need your phone to actually listen to it and have access to it. Also, for some reason Starbucks app is installed in it and Pandora. And by the way, to look over all your songs on your playlist for Spotify, you need to have premium. Overall, I would expect more for a product that costs $200.",3

It was supposed to be water resistant to 50 meters. It got splashed one time and stopped working completely. I have only had it one year it is completely done in. I would never recommend this product to anyone. I wish I could have gotten my money back.,1

Will never buy one again and will not recommend to anyone to purchase.",2
0,I've only had the Versa 2 for about 3 weeks and already the band broke on it. The band caught on a grocery cart handle the wrong way and the metal bar that holds the band in place tore right through the band like butter. I liked the snap in band that I used to have on my Charge 3. Only broke once in the 3 years I wore it. I'll be taking a closer look at the bands when I buy my next Fitbit Product.,2
0,"I've had mine for about 2 weeks and it is a piece of junk. I can't get it to sync to my phone without turning the watch off and rebooting and even then it is sketchy. My battery life is approximately 36 HOURS. Yes, I have all notifications turned off and the screen on dim and it still drains the battery. For the functionality that I have with it, I could have purchased a $30 watch. I am working with Fitbit to try and resolve the issues but time will tell if I get any satisfaction.",1
1,"Not what I hoped for. Its nice but if you want a smart watch, order something else. It tracks hand movements ( I hit 11,000 a work day and probably only walk 6000 steps out of that at the most) so steps are way off. Not happy with having to buy premium spotify or buy pandora for music to work on it. You can download your music from your phone on it but I dont have any music on my phone. Not thrilled with it. .",3
1,"Just received my Versa 2 after HAVING to replace a wonderful Alta 2 (because Fitbit discounting). So, I also ordered different bands to go with the new Versa 2. Right off the bat I’m VERY displeased with the pin changing system. They are too small, easy broken and easily lost. They had a great disconnect/attach system with the Alta 2. I am having to BUY extra pins and a tool to change bands. And some bands don’t even come with the pins. Be aware of this, both with buying this product and the bands you may want as alternatives.",3
0,"I love Fitbit but I think I got a lemon. It doesn’t send notifications. I’m really bummed because it is out of the return window but I have had it less than 2 months. I have restarted it, updated it and the app, relinked time and time again and no luck. What a waste of money. It would be nice if I could at least exchange it since it’s not working right so soon after getting it. Also the clock faces keep changing and the band irritates my skin a lot. That would be an easy fix by just getting a different style but I can’t even truly use the watch as intended now. It’s basically a super expensive step and activity tracker.",1
0,"The watch was set on central time zone when I first bought it. When I go into the Fitbit app central time is still selected but for some reason even though it is 6:57 PM as I am typing this my Fitbit says 6:44 PM. The most annoying thing is that shutting it down or updating the time in the app does not fix this problem. The amount of minutes the watch is off by increases as time passes. It started at 2 minutes which I didn't mind then went to 5, 8 and now 13 minutes with now way to fix it. The heart rate tracker works most of the time but will sometimes cut off during workouts. The calorie and step counter work fine. The Fitbit app no longer offered sleep tracking unless you buy their premium service.",2
0,I loved my Versa 2... until it just stopped working. I bought it a bit over a year ago and have used it to measure all my activities. Yesterday I went in the pool and it died. I thought it was just the battery needing to be charged but it won't charge. It's a black screen. Won't do anything. $200 for a years use. Not great.,2
0,"Don't buy! I had the issues with notifications not alerting the watch and opened a ticket within warranty period. It didn't resolve through their known issues update. I called back which fell outside warranty period and asked what the resolution was. None. The rep has been factory reset and it bricked my watch. Called back again after waiting to hear from warranty support and they offered a discount on new watch since I was out of warranty when I called the second time. Awful customer service and they don't honor warranties, simply brush you off and wait until warranty period expires then offer a discount. Don't buy it or anytime from fitbit.",2

Hers does not have the Alexa and mine does, however, I have not been able to get it to work and not everything syncs well with my Android phone. She has the same Android and has no problems. Why spend the extra when the extra doesn't work? I will buy the Versa Lite for myself after returning this one.",3
0,"Let me start off by saying for such a high priced watch should not have that many difficulties. It comes with Pandora but you have to pay for Pandora plus that's the only way it will be able to play on your watch. Also, it will NOT stay connected to your phone! I have an Android and the watch was never stay connected to my phone, so I could not receive notifications about my emails, text messages or phone calls.I thought after a few years that Fitbit would not have this problem I had a Fitbit 3 years ago and I had this problem.Also I have something to compare since this is my second Fitbit one of my main concerns wrong with it is that it over counting steps almost by 700 to a 1000 a day. For example, if you wear while you sleep I will wake up from sleep and would have 250. Also why I was driving for 3 hours and told me that I have walked another 300 steps. Fitbit calculates way over for their steps there are many articles online about it.I thought after three years Fitbit would be more accurate and not as sensitive and able to connect to the phone. Now I see that the only thing that they have done is create watches with a fancy package but not worried about updating software in the system.",1
0,"I bought the ELAXA VITBIT VERSA2 because of the features, but there are flaws. ELAXA WILL NOT WORK OR WEATHER EITHER IF YOUR CELLPHONE IS SHUT OFF. AND YOU CAN NOT HAVE CELL ON WHERE YOU WORK. WHY DID THEY NOT MAKE ELEXA FLOW OVER THE AIRWAYS SO YOU WOULD NOT HAVE THAT PROBLEM. OR PUT HER ON BLUETOOTH ALL OF THE TIME THEN SHE WILL NOT SHUT OFF AND WEATHER EITHER. IT IS A VERY BEAUTIFUL CELLPHONE JUST SOME MINOR FLAWS. I HAD TO SEND IT BACK BECAUSE OF THAT REASON. James D. North",2
0,"I loved this watch BUT at about 18 months the battery wouldn’t recharge at all. It was out of warranty but Fitbit gave me a discount on a new purchase so I bought the Inspire 2 on sale only because I didn’t want to spend a lot of money on a short lived item. The on-line boards showed a lot of customers with the exact same problem so mine wasn’t unique. I loved the features but it wasn’t accurate with my sleep tracking and if I wore it on the riding lawn mower it tracked me as cycling. So I give it 4 stars for features, 3 stars for accuracy and 1 star for a poor battery. Despite all this I miss having it.",2
0,"I really liked this product for the first 8 months. However, most of the features stopped working after 9 months. For example, the following no longer work: sleep tracking or any other tracker function on the app, receiving calls, receiving messages. Now, it's just a watch that counts steps. I called Fitbit product support and spent a great deal of time trying different resets and settings, but they eventually exhausted their ideas and had to give up. I will probably buy a new Fitbit because I did enjoy the features, but it won't be from this company.",1
1,"I bought the Versa 2 in December of 2019. After a year, almost to the date, the button on the side no longer worked. I have seen a lot of other people had the same problem. The battery life is dwindling, so I have to charge it a lot. I do love all the features that are on the watch and the app. Hopefully they fixed the issue with the side button. The battery issue may be because it's getting older. Over all I think it's a great smart watch.",3
1,"I’ve been wanting my own Apple Watch to sync with my phone but I just didn’t want to spend the money, so I decided to try this versa two! Honestly I love love love it! Be careful though it can get scratched easily, make sure to buy protection for it or a screen protector, honestly I like it so much that I thought it was worth going out of my way for. It’s a really fragile thing. It tracks everything! And the app that comes with it is super fun, you can make friends with people who is also trying to live a healthier lifestyle. It tracks my sleep and it’s so accurate it’s scary! Apple Watch doesn’t track your sleep, so that’s definitely a plus for me. Honestly ever since I owned this, it made me more aware of my actions! It really shows how much active you are and it helps so much with weight loss.Oh one tip, if you don’t care for Alexa, I say the simpler version of versa, it’s a lot cheaper just minus Alexa. It’s great regardless! It’ll save you more money.",5
0,"I got this for my birthday last year in December. I really liked it at first. It mostly helped me understand about calorie burning throughout the day. Where it all goes down is where the top screen literally fell off the device.Of course, this happened just outside the 1 year warranty-happening the next year in February.this is why it’s getting a bad review. In order for me to have a new one I have to buy one when it shouldn’t have fallen apart like that. It also wore down my phones battery life with the app.",1
0,"I purchased this for my wife. It was working great, everything was on cue, zero complaints with the way it works. However, 5 months into it, the screen separated from the rest of the watch if that makes sense. It happened while my wife was showering.

Well.. that sucks 😕",2

I was quite bummed up that we lost our $ as we only had less than 20 days to return it (and now it is close to 3 months). Luckily, there was a customer service number. I called and we tried troubleshooting it. Sure enough, it still did not work.They are now working on replacing it with another one. So if you buy it, beware.

I love the look and the feel of the band. I don't normally like the ""plastic"" bands but this one feels like soft leather. It comes in the box with a large or a small. I am currently using the small one. I did order protective case for it so I don't nick the screen. It is a bit bulky but still a favorite!",5

I don't shower or sleep in them. I do wear them to paddle board, BUT they are meant be used in the water. I do not submerge the fitbit in water ever, because I don't swim in it. Every fitbit I have had from the outset, I have had to return-the flex, the HR, the Versa. I am sick of it. One a year, wasn't that bad-but three in one year-is terrible. I went from the Versa to the Versa 2, and now have to get yet another Versa 2 because the one I got in June is dead. This is my last Fitbit...WHEN (not if) this one dies, my loyal consumership dies with it. There are too many options out there now to stick with a product that's durability lasts about as long as Cousin Its Hair in a Barber Shop School. Peace out, Fitbit.",1
0,I bought the Versa 2 in Oct 2020 and as of today 28 June 2021 (8 months later) it no longer works. It stopped at about 2am and the screen is frozen on pictures of the icons and will do nothing else. I would like for the company to replace it but don't know how to contact them.....any ideas? I do believe the product should last more than 8 months especially since I paid $180.00 for it.,2
1,"Upgraded from a Fitbit Blaze to the Versa 2 about a week ago. I was travelling away from home when I purchased it and easily set it up from my hotel room. I exercise daily (walk, ride bike, etc.) It does a great job of tracking distance, calories burned, time, pace, cardio/far burn heart zones as well as the amount of time in the zone. I have a Sleep Number bed at my residence which tracks my sleep number and the Versa 2 is within 1 - 2 points of the bed. The down side is to benefit from the other health tracking options (SPO, HRV, etc.) you have to purchase the Fitbit Premium. After a week I am extremely satisfied thus far with the Versa 2 purchase.",4
1,"I have wanted a smart watch for a while and now that I have a Versa 2, I am happy that I finally got one. I do not use all of the features available but the ones I do use (sleep tracking, steps, reminders) are all extremely accurate and useful to me. The longer I have it the more features I explore, it has so many wonderful functions.",5
0,"Purchased and was happy with the overall esthetics and ease of navigating all the watches apps. However, could not get my watch to read my heart rate in either wrist/arm and tried all the trouble shooting tips. It would however read if I put my finger over the portion that monitored this information. I thought to myself after trying everything perhaps it can’t read through my tattoos. After further reading found that multiple people had the same issue. I actually returned and had them send me a new watch thinking it was a flawed watch. Nope, same thing. Wouldn’t read through my tattoos (fully sleeved on both arms), but read on my finger. Returned and got an Apple Watch which has no issue reading though my ink. Might want to fix this issue as many people have tattoos.",1
0,"At first, I really enjoyed this product. I wore it faithfully and used the tracking features the most. It seemed to be a nice product until the last three (3) weeks. The Fitbit stopped activating when I raised my arm or touched the screen. Many times it would not activate when I used the button on the side. I chatted with technical support and she seemed familiar with this situation. She had me sync my Fitbit with my phone and then turn it off. I had to do this a couple of times before it seemed to be more responsive to my arm movement and finger touches. Currently, the Fitbit screen lights up periodically. It doesn't respond to my finger touches or pushing the button. The last straw was this morning when the alarm went off (vibrates) at 4:30 a.m. and would not stop when I touched it. I wrote customer support about it today and I am waiting for their response. I'm to the point where I am going to stop using it if a resolution cannot be found.",2
1,This watch is like a built in health coach. If you sit to long it encourages you to get upAnd just take 100 more steps to reach a goal. I love that I can constantly check my heart rate. I’m amazed at how it tracks my sleeping patterns. This watch can and does improve your life and lifestyle.. it’s worth every cent.,5
0,"Guess i should have done more research before buying this watch. Ive purchased smart watches on Amazon that have double the capabilities this watch has for way less money... If you are looking for a watch to mainly help you manage physical activity, water and food....here ya go. But if you are looking for a watch that monitors heart rate day and night with report or blood pressure monitoring this is not it. Im not sure what you get when you ""subscribe and pay"" but just the basic functions are not worth paying over 100.00 for. I'll order one for half the price and get the functions im needing and no subscriptions.",2
1,"I would have HIGHLY recommended the watch. I wore it every day to track sleep and steps. However, I woke up to a screen glitching this morning. It was flashing off and on. Tried a factory reset with no success at first and then saw a screen with green pixels. I took a long break of trying to do anything with the watch out of frustration and started a bad review on Amazon for a watching breaking in under a year. Later, I removed the device from my app and looked up information about the warranty and started a live chat with Fitbit. They asked me what happened and what the screen was doing at that moment. It oddly looked fine. I forced stopped the app on my phone. I don't know what changed but the screen is now fine and I've been able to sync everything again. All that to say, try to get a deal on the watch and know that it might have issues.",3
1,"Bought this for the sleep tracking and the supposed pulse ox tracking that it claims to have. I was using a Garmin that did both quite well. Decided to switch because the Garmin was a little too small. Wish I had stuck with the Garmin for 2 reasons. 1 there is no option on this to monitor your pulse ox. So when it says this watch does, that is a lie. 2 the Garmin app is way better. Better tracking, better graphing, and for free. In order to get similar functions in the fitbit app you have to pay for premium. So I would recommend looking at Garmin products",3
0,"The watch died after 6 mos. To get any resolution, I have to ship it back to Fitbit and wait for a resolution which sounds like will take quite a bit of time.

1,"I love this thing so much. I started with the Charge, moved to the Charge 2 and eventually the Charge 3. I needed an upgrade because those ones didn't have many features.

Only downside: can't figure out how to control music with my headphones connected to it. Doesn't work.",5
1,"Bought this for my wife and she loves it. Helps her with fitness tracking and sleep tracking. Also has a few other cool features that she enjoys. All in all it was worth the purchase.

0,At least the customer service guy laughed when I explained that replacing a product that failed after < fifty uses with the same thing at a discount was not particularly enticing. The idea of offering the discount to friends or family was also deemed hilarious with some encouragement by me.I just love to brighten the day of these poor customer service types. They have a tough job listening to the same complaints day after day after day after day...,1
0,"A sleep history was recorded when watch was on my nightstand!!! I've had the Versa 2 for two nights. First night did a good job recording sleep data. The second night the watch was on my nightstand.

I think that the sleep app is highly suspect. Data is factitious.",1
0,"I returned the Versa 2 the day after receipt. It had counted 342 steps while I wore it overnight sleeping. I walked to the kitchen, 14 steps, and it counted 50. Complete junk.

1,"After a few months of having this I can write a better review. Overall I really like it, I’ve worn it almost every day for months and the band and watch face still look great. It holds a great charge and is pretty easy to use. It’s nice to connect with others to keep tracks of steps and keep each other accountable. One complaint is every so often it makes me reconnect the watch to my WiFi, which includes having to put it back on the charger and play around with it for 5 to 10 minutes. I notice it more if I have it on the charger overnight after the battery was pretty low or don’t wear it for a day or two. Doesn’t seem like it would be much of a pain but when you start to rely on it for text messages and phone calls it can be a bit of a nuisance. But other than that I am pretty happy!",4
0,This is my second fitbit. First one gave out so I thought I'd try another one. This one is a bit faulty as well. Doesn't track sleep very well but does good on steps and heart rate. The band on this one irratated my wrist where the first one did not. Could be I was wearing it too tight but didn't seem that way. I did like the features of the watch just not the ease of using nor the faith in accuracy,2

0,I got this watch thinking it would have a more comparison to the Apple Watch. And that i would be able to use the other apps on the watch. To use Spotify or pandora. I have to have the app open on my phone and the Fitbit app. And i find that to be pointless since it is a fitness watch. I don’t want to have to have my phone on myself to play music. And i constantly kept getting the error that I needed to sync my drive to my Fitbit app. So I had to have my Fitbit app open at all times??? I just went ahead and spent the money for the Apple Watch series 5. I am very satisfied. It’s going to be able to be both fitness and more app friendly. I love that I can’t voice text on my phone and do phone calls. And Siri is verble and Alexa was not. Alexa also was not working very well. Again had to keep connecting Fitbit Versa 2 to the Fitbit app. I am reviewing this as a 1 for the apps reasons. Also the fact that I have to pay for several Subscriptions to be able to use the extra apps. Including needing premium to get more sleep details. I didn’t have to do that with my older charge 2. Overall not happy and very disappointed with Fitbit.,1
0,"It’s a nice Fitness Tracker when it works. Most of the time my touch screen was none responsive and the device would randomly restart multiple times throughout the day and night; as a result, it did not accurately track/record steps or hours slept. Half of the time, my screen was black; when this happens, tapping the screen and/or pushing the button wouldn’t activate the device. Fitbit help forums page suggest resetting the device, easier said than done, since you must scroll over to the setting icon to reset the device, which is not possible since the touch screen in non responsive. I should not have to reset/restore my device daily in order for it to work properly. The fact that the Versa 2 allows Android users to send quick responses to text message is testament that the function exists, so why can’t users who own an iPhone do the same? Frustrated with the “not ready for prime time” software and the minimal capabilities available to iPhone users, such as myself, I returned my Fitbit Versa 2 and purchased an Apple Watch. As a side note: The Versa have a small number of apps available for download (it’s a fitness tracker not a true smartwatch); If you are looking for more than a fitness tracker disguised as a smartwatch. I suggest you do what I did and purchase a true smartwatch from either Apple or Samsung.",2

It's helped me a lot with my weight loss and I've loved being able to track so many different activities from inline rollerblading to hikes. I would definitely recommend it for its price. I don't use this watch for sleep tracking as it's pretty bulky but when I do nap with it I feel as though it doesn't track it properly but this isn't a feature I'm super interested in anyways.",4

I can't see my laps until I sync it with my phone, which I do not want on the pool deck with all the water. My original versa, before updates, used to tell me what lap I was on, if I looks at my workout summary, it would give me my splits, and it would tell me what stroke I did--free, butter, breast, back. I feel like I spent a lot of money on an overpriced step tracker. Yes, I can look at text messages, but I could do that with my old one. Functionality is way down and very disappointing from what I expected. My loss that I assumed it would work the same.",1

It still would not sync properly and cannot transfer the data to my phone. Even the time is usually wrong at this point, can not even use it as a regular watch.

You have to pay for the premium version of the app to get your sleep score. The apps for the watch are pretty bland. You cannot read the news with this device, it only shows you headlines. The mobile app for smartphones is great, it's the reason I wanted the watch but the watch itself is very lackluster. Save your money and buy either an apple watch series 3 or 5. Or a Samsung galaxy watch. you'll get more for your money.",1
0,"After having the product for a year, one of the buttons on the side become loose and stopped working. After calling around to see if it could be repaired by the OEM even for a fee, there was no solution other than a discount on another Fitbit - that doesn't solve the issue.Not only that, but after calling several local placed, no one was able to fix it.If you want to gamble with a $200 product that may last a year the watch was great. Completely disappointed in the service offered within a year of purchase. Will not be buying another.",2
0,"Most of the features, music apps, including downloading personal music to the device require paid subscriptions to different services. Would have to spend over $50/month to use the apps and features. Spotify doesn't connect, keeps saying to sync to phone even though it is. Very disappointed. Should have went with the galaxy watch 4.",1
0,"I wore this about everyday for 5 months. After 5 months, the heart rate monitor stopped working. Per fitbit versa 2, the limited manufacturer warranty does not cover normal wear and tear. Most tech companies offer a year warranty for free, even for minor stuff like earbuds. If you wish to use this watch, you have to pay for a protection plan. I did not so now this is a normal digital watch that's too expensive.Outside of that, I find that the gps tracker is wonky at time when I go running. It'll be off by about .25 miles at the least and if you have power saving mode on your phone, it'll be more.The screen will get scratched up pretty good but it still works. Menu lay outs for the touch screen are fine. Seems water resistant up to the point of my mystery heart rate monitor problem.All in all, too expensive to be worn down and ignored by customer support.",1
1,I've had this watch for almost 2 years and I still love it!!! If I forget to put it on after charging it I feel lost ALL day long....... I depend on this watch for so many things.I'm not the most gentle person in the world and I've gotten it wet several times and it keeps on going!!!!,5
1,"Purchased in Oct 2020, and it's now June 2021. Up until a few days ago I could get a solid 5 days of battery life and now barely one day. Hope their customer service is half decent and they fix this issue for me.",3
1,"Pro's and con's : The large face is eay to read but because it is large it 'catches' on sleeves ,etc. Also , the synthetic band traps perspiration . Hard to tell how accurate the sleep mode is ( How would you know ) . The sleep analysis breaks down sleep stages but does not go into detail of the stages - i.e., what percentage of rem , light sleep is ideal.Overall , the watch is great. The calorie tracker is very helpful as a reminder of how easily calories can add up. The exercise tracker is helpful as well .",4
1,"Great smartwatch for the money. I bought this as a surprise present for my wife's birthday. The built-in Alexa is probably her favorite feature, along with the sleep monitor, the exercise tracking options, etc. The app has been flimsy for her, difficult to navigate, and a challenge to find what she's looking for, only to realize it doesn't exist or is only available through the website. She can't stop raving about the accuracy. Her only issue is it doesn't count steps well, if at all when you're pushing a cart; but I, and every other user, knows to start/record a manual walk - this is her first smartwatch.",4
1,"This is my 4th Fitbit. I’ve tried a couple of other knockoffs, but come back to Fitbit each time. I like this watch because I can read it— but I do NOT like that you have to purchase watch faces. Also, it’s way to big for me. I wish I had purchased the smaller one. It tracks sleep fine, but is clunky to wear to bed. Battery life is great. The band is comfortable, but the face is heavy.",3
1,"I enjoy having it for features such as sleep tracking and receiving texts, just keep in mind you need to pay a monthly fee to get advanced analytics. That's how they get you. Some of the pre loaded apps are useless, like starbucks, but overall a very cool watch. Battery life lasts about 4 days with light use ( no streaming of spotify etc). Seems pretty durable but I still bought a cover to prevent scratching.",5
1,"I brought this Fitbit for myself and another one for my husband. It's very easy to use and does a great job keeping track of my steps, calories burned, and heart rate. It reminds me if I haven't taken enough steps to reach my hourly goal and keeps track of my sleep, just to name a few functions. I love that it can also track multiple types of exercise, like when I go for a bike ride or swim laps. I have my Fitbit synced with my husband's so we can cheer each on our progress.",5
1,"Got this for my bf as a bday present. He barely wears it because it refuses to charge or the battery life dies within a day or two! VERY DISAPPOINTED. I have one and love it, not sure what the heck is up with this one or if it’s a model issue. VERY VERY VERY UNHAPPY.",5
1,"I love this watch 🥰 I have other cheaper fitness watches and they are not even close to my Versa 2 🤔 There’s sooo much to list however, I will sum it up to a few of my favorite features starting with the clockfaces you can choose from specifically the Bitmoji 👏🏻👏🏻 The Accuweather, Alexa, and sleep scoring 😴 Beautiful graphics and sleek low design (doesn’t get caught on my shirt cuff constantly). Very pleased and the value is outstanding compared to some other overpriced watches.",5
0,"I would give this zero stars if available. I purchased this less than 2 weeks ago. This is not my first Fitbit, in fact, I've had 2 Fitbit Charge 2 and purchased a Charge 3 for my husband and a Charge 2 for my daughter several years ago. I went to a Versa 2 based upon other reviews. However, in less than 2 weeks, my iphone has not been able to locate the device 3 times despite it being on my non dominant wrist. Today, after hiking, I went to see what the stats were and my iphone Fitbit App said It unable to locate the device. In fact, I couldn't get the device to even tell time... I contacted customer service at Fitbit and while they were able to get the Fitbit working again, they had no explanation why it quit. Instead they said, it must have run out of battery which wasn't true, as I charged it Saturday evening and it registered all day on Sunday. I am going to send it back to Amazon... very disappointed in Fitbit, despite purchasing at least five for family and myself. Worse yet, the CUSTOMER SERVICE was deplorable, including the email I received from the Supervisor.VERY UNHAPPY CUSTOMER~!",1
1,"Works great! Easy to access the excercise screen. However, I can't figure out how to allow Pandora or Spotify to be connected to my versa. They are installed & it say go to the Fitbit app, but I can't find how to do it. Other than that, being able to see my heart rate, my sleeping hrs, & my steps is so easy. Plus.. I was able to add My Bitmoji to the clock face.",5
0,"i was so excited to get this watch as a Christmas Gift. After 3 months is stopped working. It was my fault that I didnt sent it back. I just didnt want to go through the hassle. I liked it whilte it worked and the band was pretty, but I can honestly say I wouldn't buy another one!",2
0,"A few months ago, I started following a 5k to marathon program, so my wife got me this for my Birthday in order to track my runs. It worked well enough for a few weeks (about 95% accuracy when compared to mapping my run online). After about a month, I noticed my runs getting less and less accurate to the point that it is completely useless for that activity. It will only register running paces between 8:30-9:00 minutes/mile. Once I was running 10+ miles, it would be about 2.5 miles off after each run when compared to online run mapping or my running app on my phone. The odd thing is that this fitbit versa 2 uses the GPS in my phone, so I’m not sure why it is so wildly different than my phone’s running app. I went back to my old Garmin which has its own dedicated GPS.Other points:- love the battery life (lasts 5-6 days)- decent as a sleep tracker- app is useful",1
0,"I loved the FitBit versa 2. However, after a year and two months with the watch the factory defect of the screen coming apart from the frame has deterred me from purchasing another. I reviewed this issue on the Fitbit community website after it occurred and it has occurred to many others with out resolution from Fitbit. I reached out to Fitbit support who advised they would provide a discount of 35% for a new one, however the defect hasn’t been fixed. While the features are great, for a smart watch over $180.00, it should last more than a year and 2 months.",1
1,Only complaint is that it will only allow me to respond to texts 50% of the time and there is a thick border around the screen that seems like wasted space. Otherwise i love this watch. Upgraded from Ionic,4
1,"Not only do I love my Versa 2, I’m obsessed with it. I’ve been wearing a Fitbit about as long as they have existed. They keep getting better. I have gotten a variety of bands, and wear it all the time. It works great, stays synced with the app on my phone, and keeps me up to date on my messages.",5
1,"Versa2 does all I need and more. This is my second one. I receive text messages from my phone. More importantly, it syncs with my WW app and earns me points for everything I do. By tracking everything, I didn't know how much I do is considered exercise. I find it accurate and I would highly recommend.",5
1,"My daughter absolutely loves her Versa 2 and wears it everywhere. These days (Jan 2020) we have SO many options when it comes to fitness trackers and health watches - for example, I enjoy my Garmin Forerunner 235 - but the Versa 2 seems to find a great balance between features, usability, comfort, battery life and looks. The only critique I'd give it is that some people's skin reacts to the band, but there are inexpensive aftermarket ones readily available.",5
1,"So far so good! The watch pairs easily with my phone, the screen has vibrant colors, there are multiple workout settings and having Alexa with me is great! I downloaded a different phone face - I only wish when I turned the screen to always on, it would show my selected face instead of the boring default one? Maybe the other would impact battery life? Overall very satisfied with the features and the interfaces.",4
0,"I had the Blaze for 18 months before it quit functioning, so I thought I would upgrade to the Versa2, as it tracks swimming laps/distance, which is one of my workouts. The Versa2 delivered 12/29/19 lasted 2 1/2 months before it died - it does nothing now but scroll through 10 languages of 'To start, download fitbit app.' I tried rebooting; re-downloading; and so on, but nothing works. So this is the last of the fitbits for me. $60 a month is just a bit too much for these cheaply made trackers. I will look to Garmin for something more durable.",1
1,I had a Versa and it quit working. I bought the Versa 2 and love it. It does everything I need. I use it mostly to track my workout info. I like the added options but my main priority is for monitoring my heart rate and calorie burn while working out. I sat the workouts that I use for easy access. I haven’t set up the Alexa option yet but will and will update then. The battery definitely last longer than my last Versa. I will update my review the longer I have it. So far very pleased!,5
0,i received money for christmas to purchase this watch My son lives out of state so i was not able to get it or connect to the app. Trying now after wasting 3 days and numerous days since I got it. Still sitting on my desk not not working I have had experts on electronics to do the job. Besides that it does not hold a charge a claimed. It was advertised as being active for at least 4 days or so This one does not last 1 even when i attempt to try putting on wrist to automatically,1
0,"I bought this watch to replace a previous smart watch as I work in medicine and I need a good watch. It has been extremely disappointing. From the moment I got it out of the box, it never worked correctly. I never got messages from my phone to the watch. If it dies, I spent hours trying to get it to sync, but typically it will not update have a useless watch on my wrist with the wrong date and time. I bought it cause of its great reviews. But it was a huge waste of money. I have googled and been on their website to figure out how to update, and it’s been useless. Only positive, it has better battery life than previous smart watches I have had in the past.",1
1,It constantly says I walk 200 steps in my sleep. Also says I am asleep when I know I've been awake for several hours. Still cant get music to work.It is waterproof so far. And app is easy to use when inputting data. App sometimes turns gray and trying to get through to customer service is impossible,4
0,"Very disappointed with this version. 8 months is way too short of a lifespan for a Fitbit. My older versions lasted at least 2 years a piece. It quit after I forgot to take it off during a quick rinse off in the shower. I could see if I was swimming for hours in a lake but seriously, I was in the shower for 1 minute and now there is a bright, thin bar of light that runs down the left side of the screen. Very frustrating.",1
0,"I bought this in july. It's only October. It almost never tracks my sleep ( I've changed from normal and sensitive in the Sleep menu ) the screen never turns on (even thought its set for when you turn your wrist. The heart beat sensor is almost never accurate. I've shut it down and turned it back on multiple times, as thats that only time to get it working again and it only works for a day.It was great for the first month or so. I'm pissed I wasted 200 on this watch.",1
1,"Got this on sale for $150, great upgrade over my two-year-old Fitbit Charge 2. Great design, responsive touchscreen, reliable bluetooth connection. Only one thing to note -- if you're getting a Fitbit, you should be getting it for the fitness and sleep tracking features. If you want something to seamlessly integrate with your phone and give you responsive notifications seamlessly, you should look elsewhere.",5
1,"The first one I sent back as it wouldn't charge past 60% and wouldn't download the update. Why doesn't it come with the upd we re already?? They sent me a new one and this was much easier to download, sync and charge. I really love it, when it works. It consistently unsyncs and takes forever and an act of Congress to get it to sync again. I've read many reports online complaining of the same thing. I think I would love it if it synced.",3
0,"The “measuring steps” tracker is COMPLETELY defective. There is NO WAY I was taking 7-10,000 steps a day! It made stuff up; tried to wear it different ways, same thing. Family had a great laugh as I would rack up 1000 steps from the couch to the kitchen and back. Carrying my iPhone is much more accurate.Sleep tracker is a joke as well. Plus, Fitbit is too invasive. They want to track my weight, food intake etc., hook up with their scale (separate purchase) charge me extra for an app, then share my information with others? Even my friends! The fitness industry is lame on this point. Oh, did I mention there’s a Starbucks icon? So I can order a coffee? This in itself is presumptive and manipulative. Why not an instant order from my local bar? The entire thing is not worth the money; it doesn’t perform.",1
0,"This is my second, and last, Fitbit watch. The first Charge 3 lasted about 8 months before the screen display became broken and unreadable. This Versa 2 worked very well for about 2 months before the battery life became less than a day long. I've had better luck with cheap watches out of China.",1
1,"For the most part I love my Fitbit Vers 2 watch. I do have issues with it tracking my ""steps this hour"" from time to time, but have troubles with it tracking my sleep without errors every morning. I hope when I get a new phone the sleep tracker works better. I love the colors and look of the watch and like that it came with two different size wrist bands even though I only need the standard size. Looks nice and I like wearing it. I also love the timer so I have it right on me when needed. Over all a great purchase.",4
1,"I use this watch mostly for the call, text messaging and ability to control Alexa so my review will cover that aspect mostly. I receive many texts and calls a day. This watch reliably alerts and displays every one. When I choose to reply to the text it has you use voice. It's been very good at hearing what I say even though I work and live in a rather loud environment. The apps I have installed all work nicely so far and she has done a great job pairing with Alexa. The battery life is fantastic, even for me. I get 4 to 5 days of battery life. I am a dog groomer by profession and this watch gets soaked multiple times a day and has had no issues. My only complaint is I have this watch on my non dominant wrist, but as a groomer I use both hands often. It frequently seems to think I am moving and doing more than I actually am. It got better once I told it I had it on my dominate hand even though it isnt.",5
0,"I got the watch yesterday and it does not work at all. My phone can't get their lateat app update because according to customer service ""it gets pushed out in phases"" which means until they get around to my group of users, my watch is completely unusable. It isnt accurate counting steps, didnt track my sleep at all, says the wrong temperature and wont stop reading in celsius. Since the reviews on google play suggest this updating routine is normal where they tell half their customers or more to shove it up their butts and deal with a product that doesnt work, i will be returning this pos.",1
0,"NOT what I was expecting when I spend $150. I thought it would have been a simple Bluetooth connection and then use some apps, but I was wrong. All this is without the premium services is a $150 secondary screen with the time and other useless features. I will be returning and not buying from this company again",2
0,"I am not happy thought I'd give it a shoot and it is just a little over a month and is still doesn't work like it should.

1,"I've found the sleep tracking is way off. It shows I slept much longer than I actually did or vice versa. Also, it says waterproof which I wanted for swimming laps, however, after reading reviews I hesitate to get it wet, doesn't sound like it's really waterproof. I wish I had shopped around more.",3
0,I had the Blaze before this. It tracked sleep for about 6 months and it just quit working. I thought I would try the Versa 2. Sleep tracking worked for 1 week and now has quit working. I don’t have the package anymore but will try to return to Amazon. This was my last try of any Fitbit device. If it cannot track sleep stages correctly is any of the other data accurate? Save your money.,2
1,Overall I'm pretty happy with my Fitbit. I am disappointed that the watch band broke after ten months & that I have to buy a new watchband already.,4
1,"All the features work for my needs and it has nice features which are mentioned in detail in posts by other users. My main issue is with the comfort level. Hence, the 4 stars. It’s too bulky and very uncomfortable, especially when sleeping. It’s like sleeping with a rock strapped to my wrist. Maybe a slimmer version or round instead of square would be more comfortable.",4
1,"I switched to this after having a pebble for years. I am very disappointed with the result. Unfortunately, fitbit decided to buy out pebble, so I can't go buy a new one.The battery life is poor in comparison to the older pebble which could do much of the same things. I feel like I'm charging it every other day, and even then, a lot of features nerf themselves or completely turn off when the watch hits 25%.It also is horrible about counting steps, one of the main purposes behind this product. I went walking for an hour and it only said I had walked about 500 steps.At least it handles the smartwatch capabilities alright when there is sufficient battery...",3
1,"I enjoy the design and functions Fitbit has to offer. I rated at a 3 because I'm leary on how well its ability to track movement actually works. For example I wake up in the mornings sometimes to find several steps already to my count. I know I'm not sleep walking. I have also observed the count to change following time driving in a vehicle. I really like and enjoy the concept, but would like to see some improvement in the functionality of its tracking abilities. Aside from that with better tracking I would be happy to recommend.",3
0,"Do not buy this Fitbit. This Fitbit randomly shuts off and stops working (after only 6 months of use). It will be fully charged and then just shut off and stop working. Nothing works to turn it back on, it takes its own time. I called Fitbit customer service and they were unhelpful and rude. They said “is it currently working? Ok then there is no issue.” There is clearly an issue because it’s frustrating to use when it randomly shuts off all the time (with full charge). I asked if it’s covered under warranty and customer service told me it was. But they said they won’t let me return this one because “right now it’s working.” I can only return it if it shuts off and never turns back on. Horrible experience and horrible product. I had the Fitbit Alta HR for years and never had these issues.",1
1,"I have had a Fitbit ever since they started, and with new products and details like water proofing, I remain a loyal fit bit customer. I work in catering, so not having to take off my watch to do dishes or reach in water coolers is very convenient. I have even showered with it and have no problems. The app is always great as well, and I love the women's health with this version as well.",5
1,"I wasn’t a watch person... At all. Nor do I really focus on anything active. But I also didn’t want to pay at least $300 for an Apple Watch– And I’ve grown to really love this watch! Very customizable so I don’t even have to worry about being “bothered” about being active or not. Although I can’t directly reply to texts (thanks iPhone hah), just getting them and the little vibration to grab my attention is great when my phone isn’t directly near me or if it’s on silent. And I’m loving the sleep tracker! Overall... I’m now very much a watch person.",5
1,"The only 2 things I DON'T love about this Fitbit is #1 the app....I'm always having syncing issues. I've restarted my Fitbit, logged in/out of the app, uninstalled/reinstalled the app and un-synced/re-synced the bluetooth. #2 Sleeptracker....hardly ever tracks my sleep properly. I can sleep 8-9hrs and it only tracks like an hour or two or not at all. Again, done all the things above to reset. I'm not wearing any type of lotion and the contacts on the back are cleaned daily.As far as accuracy (distance/steps), I measure it against a couple of other fitness apps I use as well, there's really are not any MAJOR discrepancies to report.",4
1,"I love this watch!!! Didn't really expect to be so satisfied with it! I love the style, the easiness of set-up and use, all the features available (which i still have to go through more)... My 2.5 years old grandson said he really likes it :)!The battery can really last for long. I take it of just when taking shower.What's most important about this watch that it gives me additional motivation to move since it counts all the activities (that I also connected to my WW app) ! The only thing I am little confused about is the calories used tracker...Looks like I am using in average about 2500 cal daily, and I probably don't even consume so many, so I should be loosing weight every week (which i am not) !",5
0,"About five times this year the watch has suddenly been wanky - several times it won't ""wake up."" Just when I give up hope, thinking it's dead and I should contact the company,, it turns itself on and I figure, well, that was a one-off (or two-of- now a five or six-off!). More recently, a few times it has refused to sync with the phone app, then suddenly it will behave itself.The last time, some features worked while others - such as counting steps- did not register on the phone. Then, the next day, it corrected itself. I've updated the watch software, but it makes no difference. I had a fitbit before this one, and it worked fine for a couple of years. I had recommended the fitbit to others, but now wish I hadn't. Not sure what to do!",2

It has helped me to get off of my butt and be more active. I would highly recommend this product to any senior.",4
0,Absolutely ridiculous that iphones can’t quick reply to messages. I don’t understand why Fitbit would want to put money in apples pocket but I guarantee customers reconsider buying this Fitbit when they realize. If you’re an iPhone user I strongly suggest you don’t even bother buying the versa 2. Without the ability to reply to messages it’s the exact same as the original versa which is a fraction of the price.,1
1,"so far its operating great. Does everything i need it to. I would have given it 5 stars but the special edition band that it came with is made of an odd materia that is stiff and feels cheap. The alexa link from the watch is really finicky. All and all I really like the screen and overall functions. my last fitbit lasted me several years, seems like a quality company.",4
0,"The watch has some reasonable features but at a high price. The battery also runs down quickly and after 9 months, it only lasts two days with limited use.

Everything about this has been right my parents are 81 and 82 and they’re using these things like pros we help them set them up but I saw my dad taking a text message on his the other day and reading email or something and I was like wow I don’t think I could do that it all started because of wonderful Amazon having one in stock and delivering it on Christmas Eve thank you we love it and the doctor loves that we can run a history and provide him with multiple days and times of different information,5

I have been using the Versa 2 now for 7 months and it’s glitching and malfunctioning. I really thought highly of the watch until now. The watch is in near perfect condition except for a few minor scratches. It’s never been dropped and yet it’s no longer counting steps accurately, it is buzzing at random times during the day, it turns itself off and on whenever it wants, and at times does not react to my swipes and/or pressing of the button. Unfortunately I did not purchase the insurance because I never had a Fitbit watch malfunction or stop working on me before so I thought it was a well made product. Unfortunately now I can no longer think of Fitbit as the superior product. Completely devastated and lost on what to do next.",2
1,"Overall great smart watch for the price. All the features are there and the level of health information that the app gives is incredible. Fitbit will track your heart rate and resting HR, sleep patterns, calories burned, active minutes, steps taken and so much more. I only have two complaints and they are minor: 1. The band is incredibly easy to take off, but incredibly hard to put back on so you will struggle for a few minutes to get them back on. 2. The mobile app could use a UI update. Overall it works fine, but the UI could use some improvement. Overall 4.5 stars from me.",5

The Versa 2 worked great for about 6 weeks until one day the main screen display that showed the time would not come on. The other features on the watch worked but it would no longer show the time. Thank goodness I had until the end of Jan to return the item for my money back. Not sure if what happened was a fluke, but I would be cautious when purchasing this.",3
1,"Maybe it just me, but my phone has a hard time satying connected, and also syncing... I have ro restart my phone and sometimes re- pair it to the bluetooth, to get it working again, then sometimes it just doesn't work after that is done a couple times. Other then the pairing issue, I find the watch very usefull and easy to use. Like keeping track of my sleep and heart rates. Features like alexa, and notifications are really convenient and easy to navigate.",4
1,"Nice upgrade from my Charge 2. I was looking for more features and this filled the bill. That said I need to warn that not all bank cards will work with Fitbit Wallet (Discover or Citi Bank don't) and the music apps need to be subscribed (paid) versions to link. The Messenger and Txt link is very handy so you're not reaching for your phone all the time and as a bonus, you can voice respond to messages if you leave the Fitbit app running in the background. Such fun!",5
1,"I recently purchased the FitBit Versa 2 after having used the FitBit Blaze (which they no longer make). It's a great fitness tracker. No issues. The only ""negative"" is I purchased the version with the upgraded gray/black band, which looks nice, but probably isn't really worth the $50 increase over the Versa 2 with a standard strap.",4
1,"I have not had a Fitbit in several years. The last one I had, I really liked it, but just before it was a year old it fell apart. They were quick to warranty it and send out another. But when it did the same, of course, it wasn't under warranty. I then decided to go with something different. So several years later I decided I want a Versa 2, I read the reviews of course. There were more pros than cons, so I took the step and bought it. I have only had it a little over 2 months and the touch screen stopped working. I decided to google it, only to find out that is a HUGE issue. They are going to send a new one, but it makes me wonder, how many I will go thru, and when my warranty is up, then what? You may want to rethink before you purchase this brand. I wish I had.",3
1,"Came in on time.Love the watch and available free faces. Holds a charge FOR DAYS. when I am not in a moving vehicle logs my steps great. Love the option for alexa, have to reset it up in the app often, but thats no biggie.Like the sleep tracking. Would suggest to get the premium app. Does SO MUCH MORE.",5
1,"Helps me keep my phone put away. It tracks automatically when you go to sleep. It tracks every moment it it worn. Reading and giving data. I cycle a lot and the bike tracker uses my phone GPS so it gets accurate measurements. Elevation gain/loss, heart rate, speed, length. Tons more. It gives me good feedback and helps me adapt and improve. It even can track water and food, though as you would expect you have to enter the calculations. Good tool if you are calorie counting or logging water. It's a good watch. Oh, and I bang it on stuff constantly, wedging my hand in between pallets and boxes at work. No scratches. I sweat easily and it seems to be standing up to my brand of sweat. Again. Good watch.",5
1,"Love my versa 2. I've been a fitbit wearer for 5+ years. My charge 2 was still working well but decided to upgrade. The Versa is light weight. Though it is much larger than the charge it fits better and is more comfortable. I have very small wrists and thought it might be awkward looking, but it's not at all. I'm so glad I switched. So many fun features.",5
1,"The setup process is painful because it takes a while and you are 100% forced to join the premium peed service with a free 7-Day trial. You cannot back out of the app and use the smartwatch without taking this step.The step counter is inaccurate and on the high side not too bad or too far off but definitely inaccurate.The heart monitor is a plus and seems very good. The quality of the watch end ease-of-use are also very very good.I have tried other cheaper watches from China and they are a total waste of time the Fitbit is the best option I have tried. I am not at all impressed with the battery life and realize this depends on settings used for example I don't use always on display and I turned off vibrate. I did turn brightness up to maximum but found maximum brightness not too impressive.While I am critical and do offer praise, there are definitely pros and cons to this watch in the associated app.",3
0,"ok so here’s the thing, i don’t usually like to review literally anything, but this whole situation really annoyed me. the watch band essentially gave my wrist a rash. im writing b/c this was a $170 dollar investment that completely backfired.i looked this up on YouTube and other people have just bought another band (which is what i did) but this is definitely not worth the price point IMO. all i wanted to do is stay in shape during this pandemic &and instead ended up with an allergic reaction.thanks.",1
0,"I have replace the band twice. It is hard to get it to sync with my iPhone. But the face fell off today. Guess I can glue it... but I have not immersed it in water or otherwise used it...so... I use it mostly to track steps and HR. I have had various Fitbit products over the years, and I have never gotten a good response from them about problems. You ask no doubt why I continue to buy their products? Good question. But sometimes I eat junk food too.",2
0,After 2+ weeks of trouble shooting this watch and the fitbit app my conclusion is Fitbit and Pandora know that they have a crap interface and have done nothing to fix it. If I had googled this issue before purchasing the Versa 2 I would NEVER have bought it.,1
0,"I would have given a four star rating until a couple of weeks ago when the touch screen on my Fitbit stopped working, now I have to let it go completely dead, then reset the time, and then the touchscreen only works until it’s down to about 60% power. Then I have to let it go all the way dead before I can recharge it and get the touchscreen to work again. I tried charging it back up when the touch screen stops working atAround 60% charged and that does not work. This is the second Fitbit I’ve that has stopped working within the first six months. Never again, I will save my money up and just get an Apple Watch that I can depend on.",1
1,A few months ago I was on the plane and was hit by a suitcase and back pack that fell from the top. Later I went to see what time it was and my noticed my fitbit gone. No where to be found. My wife immediately went on Amazon and ordered another. Love all its option,5
1,"I replaced my Fitbit Ionic with the new Versa2. It arrived this morning and I am so happy with it . Set up took a mere few minutes, and the update was fast too. I love the colorful screen and the way it looks and feels. I really liked my Ionic, but this is more 'dressy ' and less masculine looking. I can't comment on the battery life yet but everything else is great. Alexa works and will be useful to me. I will update at a later time.",5
0,"I am based in Kenya. I like Fitbit products, so I sent a friend going to the USA to bring me back a Versa2, an upgrade from what I have been using. I have spent the last week trying to pair it with my phone. Installing and uninstalling the App, restarting the phone- nothing. It only managed to sync today, and won't sync again. The Device is stuck at the opening message that advises I should download the App. The older Fitbit is paired just fine. And just in case its any help, my Android phone is a Sumsung 9plus.Please advice what I should do- the return window has closed (My friend came back last week), and now I am stuck with an expensive gadget that looks like I won't get to use.Frustrated, Mercy",1
0,"I have owned Fitbit's for years and have purchased Fitbit's for my 4 kids and this is by far the worst! The texting doesn't always work and the Alexs portion almost never works, it has to be constantly updated. The worst part about this watch, the reason for the purchase is that it doesn't track runs accurately which is super important for me. I tried calling customer service and they troubleshoot with me but at the end of the day, it's garbage. How can you be a fitness watch but you can't track a run? I have downloaded the Under Armour app and will be purchasing a Samsung watch or anything other than Fitbit brand! :(",1
1,"This watch was great right out of the box. I read a few reviews that said to get something else if you wanted to use it as a smartwatch... it says smartwatch right on the box! Apps work great, synced to my phone and texts right away. Set up app was easy to use and very helpful. I saw where some seemed to have trouble syncing to their phones but it was super easy. Great battery life, nice display, lots of face choices, very lightweight. I have zero complaints.",5
0,"Horrible Fitbit. Never charged fully, apps were a difficult to manage and now the clock face is completely black and won’t show even the most basic function for an overly expensive watch: time. Tried all the suggestions on the Fitbit help forum and no go. Now throwing a $125 watch into the garbage. Do not buy this watch.",1
0,"I previously had a Fitbit Blaze and i think it was a better watch than the Versa 2.... The Alexa part on this Versa 2 is worthless. Battery life is great which is why i selected it over the Apple watch, but now i am thinking i should of just paid extra for the Apple watch. The app is terrible which is why i think i never get any of my phone notifications. They say its an issue with the iPhone 13 update, but its been long enough to fix those issues. Maybe they are more compatible with Androids....",2
1,"I bought this product to help me keep track of my physical activity, meal consumption, sleep quality as well as my daily water intake. I like this Fitbit because it does exactly that and on it’s also water resistant. I’m able to receive txt msg or phone call through the watch but not answer them ( expect the txt msg, you have a couple of msg that you can quickly select). I did notice that the steps are not as accurate because I will wake up with a couple steps already mark on the watch and I know I don’t sleep walk so that can’t be it. Because of that it doesn’t get a 5 star from me",4
0,"Two Versa 2 units died and I never got it wet or abused it. The first Versa 2 lasted 5 months. Return and replace by Fitbit took about 2 weeks. Second Versa 2 lasted 7 months, return and replace by Fitbit is 3 weeks and counting. The second returned unit was getting extremely hot in the charger and they asked for the charger to be returned also. My impression looking at community posts on Fitbit is that this is a common occurrence for Versa 2 and I think there is some fundamental flaw in the device. Versa 2 is still shown as a product on the website but it is somewhat hidden in the community help site. I will update once I get my 3rd device.",1
0,Advertised with a 6+ day battery life. Mine needs recharged every 3 days. Don't believe the advertising on this one.,2
0,"While trying to set up watch refused to complete. Tried resetting only to have error message that I could not get around no matter what I tried. This is second fitbit product to do this, first was Versa and this is Versa 2. I had to return for refund. This will be last of these I purchase.",1
0,"It doesn't say anything about connecting to the cellphone, receiving text messages. It says it does this it does that. It doesn't say it doesn't receive text messages, it doesn't show calls or controls taking pictures. Yes it connects to Alexa it checks your heart rate and blood pressure. I want it to get texts, see calls.",2
0,It lasted less than 4 months. The battery lasts for one day and it stopped keeping the right time. I was on a call with customer support for almost one hour. Had to shut it down and restart it like it was a new device and is still not working.,1
1,"This has been water proof so far. I can not get it to sync to my phone no matter what I do. I have followed the instructions and had others try as well. Does not work in that aspect. It says it can play music and everything else, but it doesn't do any of that. The sleep tracker is really cool when it works, however it usually takes about 8 hours after I wake up for it to show the results. Good watch, but its a lot of money for just a watch.",5
0,"I bought this device because I was tired of running with my phone. I dowloaded the app, linked with Strava, but to my disappointment, unless you have your phone with you, or has GPS signal on your entire run, Strava will not sync.I like to run in trails, and the watch is useless. Plus the milage is distorted. I ran the same route and the watch says it is .3 miles longer. It is a disappointment unless you want to manually enter your runs and bike rides on Strava.",2
1,Love this watch. Battery life is terrific and recharges fast. The sleep app is my favorite. Highly recommend.,5
1,"This watch has done everything I expected it to and more! I love the step and sleep tracking as well as notifications, weather, timer, media controls, etc. When it first came, I had to leave it on the charger for 30 minutes before it would come on. Sometimes the battery starts wearing down faster than usual and I just reboot and it's fine. The fitbit wallet doesn't accept my bank, so that is my only complaint! OVERALL I love it",5
0,Had one then had to send it in because it was defective. Got a brand new one this one I'm reviewing and it worked great for a hot minute then all of the sudden it started acting weird it wasn't recording things. This is defective. Had to buy my wife a galaxy watch3 that seems to be holding up well.,1
1,"I don't go anywhere without my Versa 2 for many reasons. I've had a Fitbit for years and rely on the sleep tracking, step and activity tracking to keep me on track. I like the options to log regular exercises and the integration with other fitness apps. I also live the convenience and integration with my wallet, being able to pay at my work cafeteria without bringing my actual wallet. I look forward to increasing capabilities from FitBit!",5
1,"I have become very attached to my Fitbit and this model has been the best one so far (I’ve had a few different kinds over the years). It’s great when your friends and family also have fitbit because then you can get into various step challenges with them, keeping everyone active and competitive. I use this as a normal watch too. If you’re looking for a way to get more active and make it fun, try fitbit. I always find myself trying to make every metric green every day.",5
1,"I love, love, love my Versa 2 Fitbit! It keeps me accountable for everything I’m doing to get healthier. It reminds me to drink more water, how much I need to eat or not eat the rest of the day. And many other things, that i used to supposed to do but didn’t do.",5
0,"I've loved this tracker, but a few days ago it started not working right. At times it looks like there is a static coming over the face of the tracker and you can't see anything. It seriously looks like aliens are taking over the tracker!Anyone else have this issue...is there a fix for it? Does this have a warranty?",2
0,"For the product itself, that's yet to be determined. The main issue here is that the versa 2 can't be used as a kids account. That wasn't mentioned anywhere. The only way to keep the watch for him is to set up a full access account under my info on his tablet. Only the ace is allowed for kids setup. The ace is not for pre teens. Very poor that fit bit can't make all products to be available under the family account. Also, for a family account, the child must be 13 or younger. That seems very young before being allowed a full account without parental control.",2
0,Brought the Fitbit Versa 2 because i heard that it was the best one with the most features. Then during set up you need to connect your phone to the watch via bluetooth and for sone reason my phone said it couldnt connect. After restarting the fitbit then my phone I still couldnt connect. I went to the forms on the fitbit website and discovered that the samsung note 8 isnt a supported device. I dont know why its not since they support galaxy S6. So I've refunded the versa 2.,1
0,"Own the Versa 2, hands down the worst watch ever. Had 3 replacement or repairs and they all died after 4 months. Kept charged anytime they got to 40 % power. All eventually had the grey screen of death. I can not say enough bad things about it. On the positive I did like the software interface for data review. I bought a 40 dollar item and it lived longer than the fitbit and was more accurate.",1
1,"I wanted to like this fitbit. I bought it for myself as a birthday present. But it doesn't seem to properly track information. I don't like the lack of variety in what I can do with it. I actually just finally gave up on its inconsistencies and my applewatch is coming tmrw. For a little extra money, you can get an apple watch 3 which has much more flexibility. My daughters love theirs. I'm disappointed in my fitbit and wouldn't buy again.",3
0,YOU have to purchase the monthly service to get this to do anything I dont need to pay for any more services It was bought on Prime day in October 4 months ago and I can not return it.... It doesn't even tell the correct time when it is fully charged and you can change settings unless you login which requires a membership fee.... so mad I fell for this over priced ugly piece of crap,1
0,Had a Samsung Gear Fit 1st generation for years until it bit the dust. Bought the Fitbit Versa 2 and man this thing is a pain to use. So manual to set up: from downloading apps and syncing them to being UNABLE TO SYNC PHONE ALARMS.If you're a Samsung user stick to that series. This gathers dust on my nighstand.,1
1,"This is my second fit bit. I got this one to replace the last because the battery life was at a point where I had to charge it every night. This lasts between 5-7 days between charges. It does everything that I need it to do. I don't know how accurate the heart rate monitor is, but that is not why i purchased it anyway so it doesn't matter to me. I have always liked fit bits and will get another one when this one life cycles out.",5
1,"I like the fact that it tracks my sleeping patterns, heart rate, steps I take, and also the current weather (today & the week) at a glance. Longer battery life than my fist FitBit watch, plus... the Versa 2 is water resistant!! Awesome!!",4
0,"I have been a Fitbit product user for years. I decided to upgrade from a Charge 2 model to the new Versa 2. Unfortunately, I was unable to pair my current phone (LG) to this watch. So I called customer service to help me with troubleshooting. The service agent I spoke to was extremely rude and unhelpful, telling me that she could no longer help me because Fitbit does not support LG phone brand. This does not make sense to me since I've never had trouble with any of my other Fitbit devices. Maybe it is the upgraded product and new software, either way, the Fitbit Versa 2 does not connect to an LG G7thinq phone. Save yourself the time and money.However, rating it 2 stars due to its very sleek and attractive design.",2
1,I love this. I went from a small fitbit to this and this is so much easier to see the screen. I like the sleep tracking much better. I love that it uses my emojis.,5
1,"The screen flipped over to one side. I glued it back down. It charged one time fine. The next time, the charge heated up the watch and the screen never turned back on. I loved all the features but think a watch that costs that much should last longer. I never used in the shower or swam with my watch even though it was supposed to be water resistant.",4
0,"Purchased item for my birthday in April 2021. My Versa 2 went dead and stopped taking a charge in May 2021. Not even 30 days old. Amazon told me that it's still under manufacturer warranty and to contact Fitbit. Fitbit has made me jump through hoops to try and get a refund or replacement. They make the return processs very hard instead of doing the right thing and immediately sending me a mailing label so that I can return it. As of June 28th, 2021, I have a new $175.00 paperweight. I want to participate in the Fitbit walking challenges with my friends, but as of right now I am a dissatisfied customer and I may never buy another Fitbit again!",1
0,Strating to malfunction it. Has a hard time charging and it does not hold a charge anymore. Does not want to sync up to my phone most of the time.,1
0,"I can not rate the watch as far as how well it works. What I can say is that immediately after opening the Fitbit box, while sitting on the floor, opening presents, my wife dropped her new watch. From about 18 inches up, the screen shattered. How does a fitness watch break after such a low fall? If you want this watch, make sure to buy the extended warranty because these watches are extremely delicate. I would not purchase another one.",1
1,I can't express how much I am loving this! I charged it for an hour when it first arrived and the battery lasted almost 6 days. The sleep tracking is great and I love the reminders to be active! I also love that my calendar reminders from my phone are coming through as alerts on my watch! I am finding it so much easier not to forget things now. Plus this is the added motivation I needed to be active and get fit! I love the color so much as well!,5
0,"Received Versa 2 on Saturday, set it up and left on charger until Monday when my screen protectors arrived, so it had not been touched. When putting it on, I noticed the touch screen wasn't working. Wouldn't swipe, didn't react at all (without screen protector). Rebooted multiple times, no luck. Did factory reset per instructions found on Fitbit Community website. No luck. Uninstalled and reinstalled Fitbit app on my Android phone, was able to go through the reset process and the ""Reset Failed!"" message was returned. Still no response from the touch screen. Did this same process multiple times using Android and Windows 10, with same result. When looking at the Fitbit Community site, it appears this is a major issue for this particular version, without a resolution. Most got a replacement from Fitbit or a refund. I am returning to Amazon for a replacement, I want to give it another try since I do like Fitbit products. However if I get the same result, I will be returning and getting my money back.",1
1,"I’ve been a 24/7 Fitbit user for 4 years (usually Charge 2 or 3), and this is the first time I’ve stepped up to one of the smartwatch-type trackers. To be honest I still don’t usually use the cute apps and functions. But the big color display is pretty and easy to read, the exercise tracking is much less cumbersome, and I’ve noticed improvement in accuracy on the heart rate and sleep readings. Unbeatable at this price point.",5
1,"For the most part its been great. I just have not been able to get notifications of text or calls since the 2nd day I had it. I have done everything I can to figure put why and since I have seen other reviews with the same issue with no resolution, I am thinking its a firmware issue that fitbit techs need to work on. Would love for the notifications to work but I am happy with the rest of the functions of it.",3
0,"I purchased this fit bit Versa 2 to track my exercise, sleep and to tell time. I had continuous problem with the watch failing to alert to incoming messages. Today the watch has decided to ignore my touch. The result is it is now just a time piece that may or may not display the time. I have spent the better part of the day researching, restarting, and all to no avail. I would have to say the Versa 2 by Fit bit is not a product I can recommend.",1
1,This is the same basic style as the Versa with the exception that this tracker only has one button instead of three. The display is much better and I believe the functionality is improved. The battery last for 6 days! I could barely get 3 from my Versa. Huge improvement. There more options for things one would like to track. The operation is simple and improved. It has Alexa compatibility but I have not used it.,5
1,Love my Fitbit. Very light weight.Everything I need on the face of watch.I put my look alike girl (. ) on the face and have enjoyed all the things she does. I was having coffee with my sisters and she popped up sitting in a cup of coffee. My sisters where cracking up.Love that I can read a text while walking. And the music. I just haven’t figured out how to answer the phone on it. Heart rate and sleep tracking are awesome,5
0,"I owned one of the first Fitbits that came out in 2015, wore it for about a year and it fell complete pieces. I bought this on in feb of this year and it will not sync or do anything..and good luck trying to contact customer support. I will never deal with this company or their products again. 👎👎👎👎",1
1,"I like that this option is more affordable than their other basic model step trackers. My only complaint is it's inability to pair with Google fit without having to download the app fittofit. Hopefully now the companies have merged, fitbit will allow easier access to pairing with google fit in the future.",4
0,"Besides it being hard to sync sometimes, it’s been a decent watch, but after 18 months, a piece of the metal has broken away so it will no longer hold the band. I’m a homemaker, I’m definitely not hard on this watch. For as much as these cost, they should not break so quickly. I give it a 0/10 for quality!",2
0,I had a charge 2 for a couple of years but decided to upgrade to the Versa 2 since my screen was cracked. Bad choice. 3 weeks after having my Versa 2 and the screen won’t turn on at times... I can’t flip through the screens like the touch screen won’t work. One feature I liked was having the alarm but I can’t turn off the alarm because it wont recognize my tap to turn it off so then it goes into snooze mode. Very disappointed that I wasted my money on this piece of junk... maybe I should have spent the extra money for an apple watch instead,1
1,"I have used the Fitbit Charge HR & Charge HR2, and now the Versa2. My Charge HR, & HR2 still work just fine. My new Versa is awesome. Love how quickly it charges, clear screen quality, easy setup, accurate data from my workouts, no missed notifications, texts, or phone calls. Spotify App was an easy fix. Setup app as directed per my premium account, then I reset my phone by turning it off and bk on. App works every time now. This smartwatch is definitely worth purchasing.",5
0,"My best Fitbit yet and believe me, Ive had almost all of them. A welcomed upgrade from the worst non functional Fiitbit ever (fitbit charge 3)! My only complaints : the embarrassingly poorly designed charging cable! How in the world did that design get approved whereas it has to lay the product on its side to be charged. The watch band is the most cheap and flimsy that I have ever seen on any Fitbit. You are going to have to buy a decent band on Amazon.",2
0,I have had my Fitbit Versa less than a year and it no longer works properly. The touch screen does not work nor does the button on the left side. It is stuck on the wallet screen. If I let the battery go completely dead it will reset to the clock face once charged but goes back to wallet screen as soon as you swipe. This is a known issue with this model. Sadly Fitbit customer service doesn't offer any resolution other than buying a new one. So completely dissatisfied with Fitbit!!,1
1,"So far I really like it a lot. It doesn’t come with instructions on what everything means so you have to go to the mobile app for that. I replaced the band just for comfort purposes.I’m still getting used to all the different apps but so far I really enjoy this watch and tracking my activities, calories, steps etc.",4
1,"This Fitbit has all kinds of bells and whistles. The special wristband for this edition is pretty enough to wear to work, and it came with addition wristband styles and sizes. It went through set-up and synced with my phone easily. Unfortunately, it's more focused on fitness then the two main reasons I bought it. The sleep tracking function only detected three hours of my sleep in over a week of use. Even then it couldn't give me the sleep quality score for that time. It also does NOT have the capability to monitor blood pressure. Without that, I cannot safely exercise to need the watch whatsoever. I was told to look for lower end watches. IEverything else seemed to function well. As a watch, it kept time accurately. If I were a healthy individual it would have worked well for me.",3
1,I only have 2 complaints right now and that is that it really does not track indoor cycling very well. Can track time but not miles. I also notice that all I have to do is brush my hair and it records it as steps.... not sure why....I also have to state that the battery does not last as long as stated. I get only 3 days per charge.,3
0,"Worst piece of tech I have ever purchased. Bought one for my wife for Christmas, nothing but headaches. Constantly losing sync with her phone, voice text won't work, keeps popping up transcription error, then some other error and to try again. Thought it may have just been a bad unit. Sent it back and bought another. Nope same stupid problems. After some research this and other issues are a common issue for the fit bit. Never again. I'll happily buy her another brand.",1
1,I absolutely love my Fitbit. I wear it all day and track my activity. I wear it at night and track my sleep. It is helpful in every way. There are many apps including Alexa which are convenient to use. I prefer this over the Apple Watch because I don’t want to get phone calls. I totally recommend it.,5
1,I bought it as a gift for my wife a couple of years ago. Still works and my wife likes it.,5
0,"This is the last Fitbit I’m going to buy. First, the battery runs out in two days, the screen will get stuck and therefore will not allow me to turn on and even look at the time. What’s the use of having a watch when you cannot even tell what time it is? It will no longer let me change the screen so I can look at my steps and other applications. And of course, this all happened The week after the deadline to return the watch. I only bought this the end of January. I’m going to get an Apple Watch now. in the long run I think I’ll just save money, this is the second fitbit that i’ve had to buy quite early to replace the first one. Maybe my fault in giving them a second chance? . I’m really disappointed in the strict return policy. DO NOT BUY.",1
1,"The heart rate meter failed after about 8 months and had to continually factory reset it to allow it to work for a few days. Call Fitbit customer service and they told me I’m probably not working out as hard as I think and I should see a doctor and said there’s nothing they can do for it. A fitness watch that is inaccurate in its readings is not a fitness watch, it just a watch. Not even a year old and it’s pretty useless. Customer service at Fitbit is ridiculous!",5
1,After the first 2 weeks of using this watch it stopped synching with my phone i changed my phone in order to keep using the watch. Now after a month or so the side button has stopped working and when I looked on youtube to see how to fix it many customers have the same issue and no way to resolve it. Am just writing this review because i only started using the watch about 6 weeks ago since i bought it.,3
1,My husband recently gifted me a Versa 2 after using an Alta for four years. I am really happy with my new tracker and the added features are a plus. The app is easy to use and the device was simple to set up on my Apple 11 phone. I don't see any reason to spend twice as much on an Apple watch for basically the same fitness information. I am very happy with the Versa 2.,5
1,"Great watch!!! Exactly what I wanted. Easy set up, it was over halfway charged when I turned it on, you can just download the app and change clock faces anytime, the Bluetooth set up was a quick sync, perfect size for my wrist, comfortable to sleep in. I set my alarm with ease.. nice sleek look. Very nice product at an affordable price. I have another Fitbit that sets up the same way so I knew what to expect. It’s definitely an upgrade for me. It tracks my steps, heart beat and BMR (basic metabolic rate) so i know how many calories im currently burning at rest. All on display. Very accurate!! Definitely would recommend!!",5
0,"Unfortunately this watch does everything it advertises it is going to do, but only for less than 3mos in my experience.I loved everything about its capabilities, design, and app - until less than 3mos after purchase, the sleep tracking and heart rate monitoring completely stopped.Done all the researching and troubleshooting I can do and it appears as though this issue is one FitBit is aware of but does not intend to fix, chopping it up to a ""user error"". The watch was as tight as recommended on my wrist, regularly charged and updated, and never even exposed to water/humidity - definitely not a user error.Don't waste your money. Maybe try the versa 3, but this is my 2nd FitBit device to stop working for no reason. Will be switching to another brand.",1
0,"The primary reason I purchased this was for the Spotify app, only to find out the Spotify app does not have offline support. Without offline support, the Spotify app is useless - it essentially is a remote control for your Echo (which is already voice controlled) or phone (which is in your pocket). No music when away from WiFi or without your phone. Please fix this and I will revise my review.",2
1,I received my Fitbit Versa 2 a few weeks ago! I love it! It helps me keep track of my workout and I have improved since receiving it. I have no complaints about the watch itself. My only complaint is that it’s advertised as containing 2 bands and I only received the one on the watch.,5
0,"After a few months, the device won’t turn on. I bought the warranty which is impossible to find on Amazon. Waiting On seller to fix the issue. There is no damage to the item, it literally won’t turn on or charge.",1
0,I’ve bought 3 different fit bits since 2020. They are not reliable. I feel like a fool for upgrading to new improved crap two times.I will no longer make that mistake. They last less than one year and then fail.Apple Watch here I come.Forget Fitbit and it’s glitching products and software,1
1,"Bought this for my wife. Transitioned from the Samsung gear S2. Super light attractive watch. Very functional but there are a couple of things that bug her. First, the watch send to have a minute or two lag time for text alerts. (I reset the watch a couple of times) The second is that it does not alert you when you get out of range of your phone. Somethings that the Samsung did very well. Just my two cents...",3
1,"I have no issues with the watch. I know it isn’t as useable as an Apple Watch would be for my iPhone. My debit card and credit cards do not work with the fitbit wallet function because the local credit union isn’t listed. If you use a more national bank like Wells Fargo or Bank of America, it will be okay. Regardless, it does the usual smart watch things very well without having any system preferences to either IOS or Android.",4
0,"I bought the product because of the Spotify and alexa built in, unfortunately those things don’t work unless the app in always open and refreshing which can drain the battery. I enjoyed the different clock faces that were available, although some of the clock faces and apps cost money which seems silly after you spent so much for the product but that’s business. The only things that worked without the app were some of the games you could download, the basic stuff (heart monitor, steps, etc) and the timer.",2
0,"I’ve had my new watch for only a month and it has died and will not recharge at all. It’s very frustrating when they give you instructions as if I don’t know what I am doing, but the problem isn’t me, it’s the watch. It has been sitting on the new charger for 2 days and still dead. When you email Fitbit they give you the same answer over and over... I have owned different Fitbit watches, this is the worse.",1
0,"Let me start by saying I've had previous ones and I'm not technologically challenged. 1.) It DOES not have Spotify on it, that's a lie. 2.) It doesn't work independently of the app and the app is inaccurate and wonky. 3.) Doesnt track sleep or give sleep score on device or app. 4.) You can't swim with it. DON'T BE FOOLED.",1

0,"I bought the $30 Fitbit a couple of years ago and returned it after I couldn't figure out the connection issues so I was hoping this more expensive one wouldn't have those problems, but for me it did. After a day I could no longer receive text/email alerts and unfortunately that's what I got the watch for. I tried all of the things a few Google searches told me to do to fix it but couldn't figure it out. The other features seem accurate and it's useful as a fitness tracker.",1
1,"I love the versa 2 for almost all aspects! If I was nit picking there may be a glitch with logging water intake from the watch to your phone app. But honesty that doesn't matter when considering the whole product. The battery life is amazing, logging workouts is easy and accurate, and the look is sleek. Battery life is huge if you want to be tracking your sleep instead of charging it at night, it only needs a short 15 minute boost every 3-4 days to stay above 70%. Love it.",4
0,"This is my 2nd Fitbit that lasted only 13 mos. For a $200 purchase, I would expect a much longer lifespan, and of course I just missed the warranty window both times. Super disappointed.",1
0,I was so excited to use this watch for my weightloss journey but this watch never provides you any motivation to do excercise... because when i wear the watch and just sit in one place my calories will burn for 1500 cal by evening.. and sometime i never wear it watch during entire day and during my evening walk i use to wear but before that when i check my calories on watch it shows i have burnt 1800 cal without even touching my watch.. I literally hate this new version on FITBIT..,1
0,"I purchased this October 16th 2020 for my wife's birthday and gave it to her October 26th 2020. This week, just over 7 months later, it stopped holding a charge. Up until now it would last almost 1 wk on a charge now it doesn't last 1 day. Also bought the 3 yr warranty. DO NOT PURCHASE!",1
0,"I have to hold on to the handles of my treadmill due to vertigo. Falling off my treadmill would not be a good experience. Well, with the Versa 2, it will not count steps if you're holding on! You have to be swinging your arms for the steps to count. I just bought the Versa 2 and today was my 1st day to use it. I never had this issue with the Fitbit Alta which I've had for 4 years - I held on all the time with the Alta and it worked fine. I will be returning this Fitbit Versa. Am very annoyed and frustrated!",1
0,"Not sure why a ""Bordeaux""/wine color band is actually more plum/deep purple, but I'm pretty upset. I hate purple, and if I'd known this wasn't going to be more maroon, I would've chosen the ""petal"" colored band. Needless to say, now I'm going to have to spend even more money after I've already spent $200 to buy a different band before I can even wear this to try it out because I'm not wearing purple.",2
0,I am resending this feedback. I don't recommend this watch since it has a lot of issues keeping it synced. I tried several ways to fixed without luck. I contacted fitbit support and it was very difficult to get support or to fix it. I bought this to use with whatsapp and it get disconnected. Then I need to follow some steps twice per day and it keeps having issues with the sync. Very frustrating.,1

I have had this for less than 3 months.",3
1,"I love my Fitbit Versa! It's one of the best purchases I'm made for myself in a long time. It looks fabulous on me and the features are a great. I was going to invest in an apple watch, but decided against it. My fitbit gives me all I need. I do question the accuracy of the step counting though. It counts steps I haven't taken. So that needs to be fixed, other than that it's a great watch and fitness tracker.",5
1,This watch does what it is supposed to do unlike the other cheaper fitness watches I have purchased.,5
1,"Bought the refurbished fitbit versa 2. Battery life is good and last over a week. I don't have time to charge, so I'm glad it last long. I use it to track my steps and sleep. I find it very convenient especially timer.",5
1,"Too much trouble. I had to send my new phone back I could not get it going it was the Awful phone.Thr first time I had a fitbit it was great, the versa 2. I had to replace previous unit. I broke it by mistake. My fault, too bad. I like the phone . The latest phone was too much trouble.Now I have to get a new phone.",5
1,"I had a Fitbit blaze before I got the versa 2 and I loved it! The only thing that I wasn’t a big fan of was that it wasn’t waterproof, just water resistant. However, the versa 2 is awesome! It is much more customizable and is waterproof. The only thing I’m not a big fan of is the ability to play music from it because I only use Apple Music and it doesn’t work with that. Also, the free version of Fitbit coach is horrible and Fitbit has done nothing to fix it.",4
1,"I started CrossFit this year and I wanted something to track my activity and be able to set manageable goals. It records my calories burned during my workouts, tracks my steps, and gives me great feedback on my sleep quality. This syncs with my phone so I can get all of my texts and call notifications which allows me to be less dependent on my phone being on me at all times. I have had this for a little over a month and I love it!",5

0,"I was very happy with this watch until two days ago it started working like my Fitbit charge where it wouldn’t correctly record my heart beat for workouts I do all the time. The app wasn’t recognizing the watch on my phone and said device not found. I had my other watch for two years. Not less than 2 months. I ordered my watch on Dec. 2nd but it was not in stock and didn’t arrive until Dec. 11, 2019. When I went online to return it on Amazon they said the return window had closed on January 31 st. Now what do I do? My money was just wasted on a product that’s defective. They used the Dec. 2 order date?",1
0,"Hands down the worst watch I have ever owned. The accuracy is awful. It is very confusing and not at ALL user friendly, you have to connect it to the computer to change the time. When I connected to tbe computer, it hooked up to an APP that buzzes every 10 minutes on my wrist and it is like a virus. It says I must buy it. I will likely throw this wat h away. It is so frustrating!!!!",1
0,"Don't waste your money! The Versa 2 has many known issues none of which have been resolved. Customer service/tech support os a joke (and not any call centers in the USA.)The phone and Versa 2 will not stay paired (even though blietooth shows it is. Therefore, you don't get ANY notifications , apps don't work and it doesn't record anu health/fitness info accurately. Way to ho Fitbit! Between having a useless product and no customer support in the USA, you just lost a bunch of customers!! (SMH)",1
1,"I was skeptical at first because there were so many negative reviews, but I haven't had any issues with my FitBit since I've bought it. The set-up was really simple. The step sensitivity is great because it captures a lot of different movements (doing yoga, weight training, etc.) instead of just full on steps. Sleep tracker is really great too. I don't use the app as much, but it seems to be pretty straight forward. You can also choose the type of workout you are about to do and it'll record all sorts of data. I really am in love with my FitBit!",5
0,"I live in Brazil and I've been using my Versa 2 since January (a friend of mine brought it from the US) and in the past 2 weeks I've been facing a really annoying issue. Everyday at a random moment the Fitbit logo appears on the screen and nothing else happens. It simply stops showing information and syncing my data and it takes a few hours for it to work again, so it's been useless, because it doesn't track my activities correctly and it's messing with my stats.I’ve been in touch with Fitbit’s support for days and they simply doesn’t provide me with a solution. My suggestions were to replace my watch to a Versa 2 that works properly or to give me my money back in case they’re not able to guarantee that any of their watches work properly - it looks like this is the case, since I’ve been reading A LOT of bad feedbacks in the internet and it looks like I’m not the only one that hasn’t been supported by them.Here’s my advice: spend more money and buy a Apple watch. The saving is not worth it at all.",1
1,"I like everything about watch, except the sleep tracking is not consistent and quite often doesn't work. I'll probably try an Apple Watch once they come out with one with a longer battery life. I have tried every solution I can find to make it track my sleep, but it doesn't fix the problem.",4
1,"Easy to set up. Easy to use. The tracking can be spotty at times but over all it's a good fitness watch. Sometimes it may miss hours of sleep, steps, or exercises if it's not set. This is not a smart watch, one isn't notified of messages or calls, but Versa 2 can automatically track the different types of exercise. You can set alarms, get notifications on agenda items, hand washing and hourly step countsTLDR: good watch, spotty tracking, good buy",4
1,"I have used fitbit watches for sometime now ,but always seem to have the same issue. The heart rate monitor after a couple of weeks it always says out of range. Have chatted called they always give the same answer reset the watch if that doesn't work get back in touch until it's to late to return",3
1,I will never buy a Fitbit again. Since receiving mine I have had nothing but issues with it. It doesn't track my sleep every night and now there is a syncing issue. Customer Service at Fitbit is absolutely no help and are extremely rude. I will be selling this POS and purchasing an Apple Watch in the very near future!,5
1,It's being returned today. My husband stole my sleeker Fit-Bit and I ordered the bigger and better one. It is so thick that it bumps my wrist against my arm when I flex it and it spins on my wrist because it weighs so much. Done...it's going back today. The app is hard to beat. Back to the sleeker version.,4
0,Was really loving this watch for the two months it worked. I woke up one morning and to a black screen and it never came on again.The price is staggeringly high for the disappointing durability—wish I could’ve gotten my money back to go towards the Apple Watch I bought to replace it.,1

1,I bought the Versa 2 as an upgrade to the Fitbit Inspire HR. I absolutely love it! My problem with the Inspire was that the face was too small which made it difficult to read the stats. Also it was impossible to read outside. The Versa 2 addresses both issues. The size and brightness of the display is perfect! I like the Bordeaux band color even more in person than in the pictures. There are some nice feature upgrades too including text notifications and the weather app. Fitbit really has a way of motivating you to move. Who knew fitness tracking could be so much fun? I highly recommend the Versa 2!,5
1,"I liked some features of the Fitbit, such as the step counting and exercise tracking, as well as the sleep tracking. But overall the device has some opportunities for improvement. More recently, the device just stopped working after about 6 months of use. I'm going to see if I can get it replaced, and I hope to provide an update later on the service experience.",3
1,"I haven’t been satisfied with Fitbit after the Charge 2. Something changed and the newer pieces don’t work for me. I was born with an irregular heartbeat and it does not capture my heart rate / sleep accurately at all. The Charge 1 and 2 were wonderful and without flaw. I still like all the features and on a larger screen. However, mine burned my skin where the sensor is. That was the last straw for me and I am going to return it.",3
1,"La vida útil de la batería es grandiosa 4 días con una sola carga. Es súper cómodo en la muñeca, luego de dos días de uso. Si puedes vivir sin un GPS integrado este watch es lo mejor que puedes pedir, Alexa es muy útil para recordatorios y funciones básicas. El seguimiento del sueño es bastante bueno según mi experiencia actual.Lo más importante: los primeros dos o talvez 3 días tendrás problemas con el conteo de los pasos ya que el reloj se va ajustando a tus ritmo. Te sugiero que lo pongas que lo usas en la mano dominante aunque no sea se esa forma te ayudará a hacer que los pasos sean mucho más precisos.",5
0,"Versa 2 functioned perfectly for 1 month from the day it was delivered. And then, suddenly, I couldn't get my calendar events. It said I had to sync the Versa 2 with my mobile app. Hours later, the same message occurred when I tried to get the weather, my sleep history from the night before, Alexa, everything. I tried deleting the app and starting over. Same thing. Then, ""no connectivity"" message, and finally, no bluetooth. My expensive fitbit is now an expensive piece of junk even after following all the app's advice on fixing it. This happened exactly 1 day AFTER I could return it. It was a wonderful gadget for 1 month. I'm livid and saddened.",1
1,"I ordered the black/ carbon one, but was sent the rose gold. Not an issue I'm goid with it. The only thing it doesn't do is sync with my Samsung Health, I have a galaxy s9 , but that's not a big deal. It works with everything else. I get texts, emails and phone calls. Spotify is there too. I'm pleased! Also it wasn't expected for delivery until April 30th but I received it on the 24th!",5
0,I previously had a $30 watch that is more accurate than this item! I regularly get email with offers to spend more money on capabilities on offer. Does not accurately monitor sleep--the $30 watch provides far better detail. Inconsistently tracks steps. The app drains my phone's battery. If not synced regularly the data on the watch does not update when synced a day later. Terrible product that is over priced.,1
0,Pros: Watch has a nice look and is very comfortable. Arrived earlier than expected.Cons: Watch paired to my device but was unable to receive notifications. I contacted the insurance that I purchased and they referred me to fitbit. Fitbit customer service was rude everytime I contacted them each time telling me to pair the watch and if it wasn't working to call back and hung up. Very disappointed in purchase.,2
1,"I’ve been a fan of Fitbit for a while. I ordered the versa two to replace my blaze that finally died. So far the watch and trackers that come with it I’ve been accurate and help me keep accountable my goals for the day. The only drawback I have seen so far, as others have pointed out, is the wristband. It rubs into your skin after prolonged use.I have ordered cloth wristbands to see if this helps.",4
0,"This device keeps un-synching with my Note 8. I contacted Fitbit & the associate advised me, my phone is not compatible. Yeah, my phone is a couple of years old, but I paid over $1000 for it & I'm not replacing it for a watch, very dissatisfied",1
1,"I love this watch. I have not worn a watch in about 15 years, but decided to get serious about my health and got this smartwatch at the urging of a buddy. It has helped me to stay on track and lose fat. The one thing that I HATE about this that you cannot get any software updates unless you activate the location feature. Once you activate it, you can turn it off, but Fitbit can turn it on remotely. Why do they need to know my location? Other than that, I love it.",5
1,"Have not had long enough to track some of the features and accuracy. The only negatives so far are that the face is not a sensitive as our older Fitbits, requiring repeated tapping to get it to respond. Sleep mode is reporting sleep when we are awake.",4
1,This watch does everything you need it to do without breaking the bank. I have tested the steps time and time again and it always seems to be right on. I also use the apps Strava and Map My Walk and the distances match up with my watch. Love being able to have it linked to my bank card for those days I forget to grab my wallet or decide to make a stop at the store after a workout. The battery holds a charge for days! The only thing I wish I could do is a quick reply to my text messages. You have this option if you have an android but darn Apple won't allow it!,5
1,"I was so excited to receive this product with the Alexa compatibility. Sadly i returned it NOT because of the product, but because i should have read the fact i could not have complete services because i have an I phone. i wanted to connect to speak for phone calls. It will do everything if you have an Android. Darn! I have always had fitbit products.",5
1,"The media could not be loaded.

1,"I liked this item until the most recent software update. When running, my mileage is way off now from my run tracking apps. Before the software update, the mileage matched what my other apps tracked. Now, it is off quite a bit and very noticeable on longer runs. I can’t find anything in the settings that would cause this. Such a disappointment.",3
0,The battery life is awesome! Charges fast and last a long time. See your texts is great. I could never get head phones to pair. The issue is the heart monitor went out. First is started giving crazy readings and now it does not work at all. I have tried everything to get it to work. Checking online and it is a common issue! Why sell something that you know does not work??? Sleep monitor only gave a score randomly as well. Wish I had just bought the Apple 5 watch instead. Going to can Fit-bit today!,1
1,"I had a Charge 3 that I really liked but couldn’t read the screen very well outside. The Versa 2 is bright, colorful, easy to read. Tracking my favorite activities is easy and helpful. I find this tracker is a great incentive to try and stay fit! I don’t use the food or water input but bet they’d be very helpful, as well. I’d get this again in a heartbeat!",5
0,So I received the watch very fast but when I opened it and try to connect it to my phone through the app but I could not get it to work and I thought maybe it will work in the next 10 minutes so I left it alone but nothing happened then I thought maybe I should try deleting the app and then download it again but that didn’t work either then I tried turning off and on both the phone and the watch and that also didn’t work… I still cannot get it to work and I’ve followed all the instructions. Someone please help or maybe I just need to return it,1
1,"I am obsessed with this watch. It does everything that I need it to and more. You can add apps onto it, schedule sleep mode, see your steps, calories burned, and heart rate. You can choose your workout that you are going to be doing as well. So far I have no complaints!",5
0,This is the second versa 2 I've owned. I broke the screen on the 1st one andd ordered a new one. The battery on this one lasts maybe a day and it's set up exactly like my 1st one. That one the battery lasted 3 Days. I'm lucky to get3/4 of a day out of the new one. Not happy,2
1,"I’ll be 79 soon, this is my 3rd Fitbit. I like being reminded how many steps I’ve taken.It really helps motivate me to get up and walk around. This one is my favorite.Big clock. Big numbers, easy to read. And pretty.",4
1,"Especially like how well it integrates with the carb smart Android app for tracking all my diet and exercise activity. Also especially happy with it's tracking of swim and aquatics exercise workouts. Not terrible but not as high marks for the Fitbit app/website tracking of meals...I did feel it necessary to pay for an app to do a better job of that. But it integrates well with other apps so, all in all its a terrific buy in my book",5
1,"Love this Fitbit! Replaced the charge 4. Works great, long battery life, love the notifications feature for texts and calls. Can turn that off when desired. Sleep tracking is wonderful. Really love it and would recommend!",5
1,"I love love love the Fitbit watch. The band was very comfortable. I love the simplicity and encouragement to be healthy. The only reason I had to return it was because I need a more accurate heart rate monitoring. Oh and the only flaw I found was, when sweating the connection on my wrist was flawed.",4
1,"Not an easy process for getting it going. Instructions not great. Tracks steps, pulse, time and calories used, but other exercise functions didn’t’t work. Too complicated, and they want to sell you more functions.",3
1,"I love it!- Having had a Charge, charge2, and then debated on Charge 3 or Versa- I went with the Versa 2 both for the screen and the ability to control and download music. I am not disappointed (except that the color is more purple than burgandy) I have not yet gotten 4 days worth of battery yet, but it does last more than 2 days consistently. You will need to carry your phone for the GPS function, and it's worth the extra to get a screen protector- all in another quality FitBit purchase. As a fitness/ nutrition professional I recommend it to clients all the time.",5
0,"I’ve had it less than a year, battery won’t hold a charge (I’m charging it a 2nd time today). It isn’t tracking heart rate, sleep, and doesn’t sync with the app well. It’s my 2nd Fitbit product, and my last.",1
1,"I bought this after we bought a fitness machine. (ProForm bike. Great deal by the way) I was a little scared, because I am in my early 60’s. And the workouts I’m doing with the machine are probably the toughest workouts I’ve had in years. Puddles of sweat on the floor. I wanted to know my peak heart rate during those workouts. This device solved that issue right away. (I won’t have as heart attack). But it does so much more! The sleep monitoring is uncanny. Anyways, I just bought another for my wife’s birthday. I’m excited to be able to gift this to her. She’s Chinese, so if you input her Country, everything should be in Mandarin for her. Pretty cool",5
0,"The Versa 2 has been my worst fitbit purchase. It doesn't count steps properly, it constantly had trouble detecting my heart rate, and finally the screen separated from the body of the watch while I was just sitting at my desk.For me fitbit's typically last at least year. There is always some issue that causes me to replace it. But this will be my last purchase for this company",1
1,I got this in December and now going on almost 2 weeks!!I have had 2 other trackers that were not accurate or quit working.I am totally loving this tracker.The sleep tracking is right on track and have difficulties in this area so it is giving me a lot of insight. It tracks your exercise and steps pretty decently also. I track my food and water as I am keto!!!This is 1 of the best gifts I have ever given myself!!!,5
1,I absolutely LOVE this fitbit! It tracks everything.. you can even record your glucose readings if you are diabetic. It even breaks down your sleep patterns if you wear it to bed. I got the pink one and it is so pretty. Very happy with this purchase. HIGHLY recommend.,5
0,"went swimming after a month of having it, now it doesn't turn on. Great.. what a waste and I can't return it bc it's outside of its return date. The product says you can swim with it! It even has a swim tracker!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! Besides it NO LONGER WORKING, I have reset this 4x in a month!!",1
1,"This is a frustrating little gadget. I weigh my self once a day and put the weight into the watch. Then when I go to look at my weight on the Fitbit phone app it shows my weight has doubled. When I add my water intake of 16 oz, it will show up on the phone app as .5 oz. The Spotify app never works, the footstep counter is inaccurate and there isn't a whole lot of worthwhile apps to download. The notifications work almost flawlessly. I'm going to keep it and hope the next update fixes all of these issues.",3
1,"I love the Versa 2!! I had the Versa and it stopped working. I decided to buy the 2. The screen on the 2 is brighter, the I cons are a little larger on the screen. It does disconnect for the app often but I also had that same issue with the versa. I'm not sure what to do about that except turn off my Bluetooth to reconnect which I should not have to do 3 or 4 rimes a week. I still love it!!!",5

0,Bought this product mid October 2020 And stop working end of October 2021. Frustrated and upset. Was thoroughly enjoying it so miss having it. I will not spend money on Fitbit anymore but will look into another brand to replace.,1
1,Pro:* Looks good. Straps are changeable.* More than just step counting. Love the sleep and hr monitor features.* capable of tracking multiple physical activities. Auto recognition of activity.* Decent battery life 4 days approximately. Fast charging. Usually charges to decent levels within 10mins.Con:* Need a connected phone for gps. Remember to enable gs on your phone before run / hike.* Not as functional as Apple Watch.,5

0,"I got this watch end of Jan 2020, and the touch screen is broken and the battery is drown to very low - needs to be charged every 24 hrs. I contacted Fitbit for trouble shooting, but they can't fix it, and asked me contact Amazon. When I contacted Amazon, and they asked me to contact Fitbit. At the end, nobody willing to fix the problem. I will never buy any Fitbit products from now on!",1
1,"I upgraded from my Fitbit Charge 2 and I'm so glad I did. I was concerned about the size of the Versa2, but turns out it's a good fit for me. I love being able to change the face of the watch. I ordered multiple bands and they are easy to change out. The battery life is not as long as they said but it works for me. I have a charger on my dressing table and I just pop it in while I'm getting ready. It charges very quickly",5
0,"If you purchased this device thinking it was an all in one, you will be frustrated. It purports to connect to Pandora, but it won't actually do it. While troubleshooting online, I saw a slew of others having the same issue, all were sent to a troubleshooting page, which was of no help. I called their customer support and was basically told that it must be Pandora's fault and I should contact them. Most of the other features work ok, but a lot of the things you can do are complex for a non-techie. There a a lot of other devices out that that do these functions just as well, and If I had it to do over, I would choose a different device. Boo on you Fitbit!",2
0,I will Never..ever..ever purchase anything from Fitbit ever again! This is my 2nd watch and neither one of them laster more than 6 months! Contacted customer service...got the run around for months! Highly disappointed! Will never spend another $170,1
0,"Couldn't get this to sinc with my Samsung Galaxy, too old a model. Phone still works great for me so no reason to buy a new one just for Fitbit. Also purchased a device to get it to work with my Windows 10 desktop, but would not upload data, it was taking forever. I mostly wanted it for sleep tracking, but tried wearing it for a night even though it didn't work and was too uncomfortable.",1
0,"loses sync. sometimes keeps it a day, sometimes just an hour. yes i do all the things over and over you are supposed to do (quit app, restart versa 2 and phone and app and bluetooth switch to different fitbit and back , blah blah. fitbit, don’t sell a p.o.s. to your athletes. i’m with coros now.",1
0,"Didn't work right out of the box, so I reached out to Fitbit support and they bricked it on day 1. Right away they emailed me a label to return it to them saying they'd replace it, but they still have not replaced it. It's been a month. Never again. Nope. Never buy Fitbit.",1
1,"Great grand son actually picked this out and paid for it with his own money. He is very happy with it. Tracks all kins of things like deep sleep, rem sleep etc as well as heart rate, exercise AND the time",5
1,"I purchased the Fitbit Versa 2 and I love it. It took me a few attempts to pair it with my Samsung Galaxy 10s+ 5G but I got it to work. This watch makes me want to challenge myself and complete all my goals. I don’t usually wear any jewelry or watches to bed but I started wearing the Fitbit to track my sleep, it is very comfortable. Over all I am very pleased with my purchase.",5
1,"I like this Fitbit better then the ones I’ve had in the past. However, after a little over a year it goes from 100% charged to 0% in less then 8 hours. It used to go for 2 days. Super annoying. I was debating getting another Fitbit but if this is what happens I think I’ll buy an Apple Watch.",4
1,"I upgraded from a Fitbit Versa to this Fitbit Versa 2, and I have been very pleased so far. One thing I am frustrated with is that when I'm exercising it somehow is pausing in the middle of my exercise. The problem is I don't catch it until I'm about fine with my hour of exercise, and I've missed tracking most of it.",5
0,"Very disappointed, everything was working great until I did a software update. Now NOTHING is calculating correctly/ while doing my hiit workouts my heart rate isn’t even hitting 100. While looking at my workout info you would think I was sleeping. I can’t properly nourish myself with incorrect information. Been going back and forth with customer service and I’m convently 2 weeks past the return date 🙄 after scrolling through the comments and seeing other people on my fitness pages it’s obvious they have issues with the updated version.",1
0,"I am definitely disappointed. All my friends have apple and I'm a galaxy user so I assumed that since the Fitbit versa was around the same price as their apple watch I would get around the same quality but I feel like I have an extremely generic version for the same amount of money. I will be returning. I have used it for 3 days thinking I would maybe learn a few tricks about it, but no.",1
1,"Poor quality materials - the strap broke within the first 10 days. Specifically, the pin that connects the strap to the watch began to wear through the rubber strap. This was disappointing, as I expected more from FitBit’s new Versa2. Other than quality, the functionality of the watch is great and very accurate.",3
1,I have used the Fitbit products for a couple of yearsI stepped up to the Versa and I love it. I’m having some doubts about the accuracy of the sleep tracking but still this is a great watch. Coupled with the “Shagpule” watch band from Amazon it’s a “Home Run”,5
1,The battery no way near holds the charge that is advertised. It does charge quickly but it might last a full day if I don't touch it. I don't use many of the features but am disappointed that Spotify and a few others are advertised but you have to pay subscriptions to utilize them. Semi false advertising. Thumbs up for being able to download different clock apps.,4
0,"I LOVE my Fitbit. But it has caused some sort of chemical burn on my wrist. The manufacturer suggestion is to ""Take it off"". I spent a lot of money on this, and it has been essential in my fitness. Very disappointed that I cant wear it anymore.",1
0,I bought the Versa 2 and tried to set it up. the process of Alexa function set up did not work and I was communicated with the Fitbit customer service. Out of 5 calls I make 2 were disconnected. I was not able to set the Alexa functionand due to terrible helpless customer service I decided to return the device,2
1,"My daughter lost her old versa lite, and I was looking for a replacement. I was expecting to pay upwards of $150, so imagine my delivery at getting to upgrade to a Versa 2 for only $119. Very fortuitous! She really likes it.",5
1,The versa 2 exceeds my expectations. I walk and ride a bike. Those apps work very well. I'm enjoying the steps count. HR during those activities work very well. Sleep and oxygen saturation are very good. It gives me the info I'm looking for. All and all a very good smart watch. Highly recommend it.,5
0,Can't get to connect to my phone. Nothing happens with when the app is loaded.. Hasn't work right since I purchased it! This the 3rd fitbit I have ordered and never had a problem getting it to work. I am about to throw in it the garbage and loose $200.00. I would like a response please!!!!!!,1
1,"I switched from an apple watch to a Fitbit as I missed the step tracking vs. the Apple Circles. This watch works great while swimming, cycling, running, or walking. This Fitbit syncs well with the fitbit app and works well with my phone. I would absolutely recommend this watch to anyone considering it! It does everything I need a fitness tracker to do!",5
0,"white fitbit has very accurate data, they have recently implemented a paywall that hides a TON of your data unless you pay 15 bucks a month. this is an absolutely insane price for information that the $150 device is already tracking. nowhere in the product description do they make it clear that so many crucial features are behind the paywall.if youre like me and youre buying this as a sleep tracker, look elsewhere. you wont be able to see your blood o2 levels during sleep without a premium subscription.",1
1,"Disclosure: I may still be in the honeymoon phase with smartwatch tech, so I may be biased.This smart watch is awesome. I thought before I was totally done with watches. Everything a watch could do could now be done 10x better with my phone.Now, the additional convenience of not having to take my phone out for time, looking at messages, NFC transactions, and having limited apps right on my wrist are so worth it!That is even before I get to the biometrics. Those are just so handy to have. I am really happy with this purchase.",5
1,Face scratches easily. Buy screen protector. Won't stay synced Tomy phone. Pretty expensive for something that really only keeps track of steps and heart rate.,3
1,"Not normally one to write reviews but here it goes.This watch has changed how I view fitness. It’s very accurate and clear to read and understand (unlike the Apple Watch).I waited three years to buy a Fitbit (didn’t want to follow the heard and buy a “fitness watch”). It’s allowed me to see gaps in my fitness that’s I’ve been able to address (I don’t sleep enough, even though I thought I was getting 8 hours, etc.).",5
0,"Not reliable, text messages work off and on, Spotify app works 3/4 of the time and when active you can’t use the other functions of the watch without resetting the Spotify app. Over all it does what I need it to do. Battery life is about 5 days to 10% and charges 50% in less then an hour. I use it in the shower so far no damage.Disappointed in lack of apps and alexa functionality.",2
1,"First i'd like to say this watch is very nice and sleek, but with that said if you are heavily tattoo'd you will find it very difficult if not impossible to get a heart rate reading from this. there is only 1 led for the sensor and does not seem to beable to get a reading through tattoo's, if i flip it to the inside it works just fine or if i wear it on my dominate hand where i have no ink it works just fine. so sadly i have to give this an overall rating of 3 because i should have to pick and chose which wrist works for the watch, it should just work regardless of ink vs no ink'd skin.",3
1,"So far this watch is great for following my daughters glucose levels right on the watchface, my reasoning for purchasing this device! My only complaint is that the color option Bordeaux/Copper Rose is much more of a purple band than a burgundy. Still very pretty but just wanted to through that out there for those that may not want a purple band! Easy fix with a watchband replacement 😊",5
0,"This is the second Fitbit versa2 I have ordered because the heart rate monitoring light quit working. Which then no longer keeps track of your sleep, resting heart rate or oxygen variations. Super bummed. Thought this was a better alternative but now that I have to buy yet another making this #3 I might as well spend the money on an Apple Watch",1
1,I can't remove some apps I do t use. The premium extra cost was a disappoint. I didnt research enough and now know what I fitbit doesn't do that I wish it sis. My next purchase will be a watch with more options and features. I cant get it to load music and refuse to pay for pandora. I have I heart but cant use it on Fitbit. Not a bad watch but It isnt what i really was looking for now that i know the limitations.,4
0,OK with the Fitbit versa to a lot of the advertisement are completely false and the product does not do everything that it says it could do. One the watch says that it can connect to your mobile device and stream music but it doesn’t tell you that the device have to be within 30 yards or feet for it to connect or you will lose signal.The technical support is almost impossible to reach and you will wait for at least 30 minutes to be cut off and no response. Was very disappointed and had to return the product,1
1,"As a cardiac patient moving is #1 in staying healthyYou can set your daily goals, keep up with sleep 💤 is also important for me - everything else was way to complex and this does what I need.👍",5
0,"I got this watch for health reasons. I have recently had emergency surgery to repair an ulcer, gone through kidney failure, now have dialysis…and mitral valve stenosis. I was told by cardiologist to watch blood pressure, heart rate and blood oxygen levels. In my research, this watch was to provide those three functions. But it only does the heart rate. This is an expensive heart rate monitor.",2
0,Loved it for the first 2 weeks. Now it doesn’t even send the notifications to the Fitbit so I can see them. I upgraded from the Fitbit charge 2 and I would go back to it. It has good battery and sleep tracker is good I guess but I got it to be able to my notifications on the Fitbit. My old one in my opinion is better.,2
1,Works very well. Only advice I would give is to purchase a screen protector and putting it on the screen BEFORE WEARING IT!!! The screen scratched soooo easily - within first few hours of wearing. Very disappointing.,5
1,Super. Útil. Solo falta responder mensajes,5
1,"Have already reccomend to friends. I love it! I dd a bit of research and decided to go with the versa 2. My only hesitation was no gps, so far it has not been an issue. Its a bit bulky if you are not used to wearing a watch, but within a couple of days it was comfortable.",5
0,"It's a great idea but so incredibly inaccurate. I should have sent it straight back.It dousnt matter if it's set to dominate or non dominate. I don't need to have a macine give me kudos for activity steps I never too. Hate, hate hate it.",1
0,My old blaze had perfect sleep tracking every night. In 14 nights this hasn’t even realized I slept at all.Very disappointing. Many comments on the user boards with no resolution.,2
0,"If I could go back I definitely would not buy this product. This Fitbit has given me nothing but problems. It does not stay paired with the app and the time lags (it’s currently running 3 minutes behind normal time). I have tried uninstalling it and syncing it over and over with the app to no avail. I did not have any problems with my last Fitbit (Charge 2) and I was hoping for good things with this one, but that’s not the case. The Versa 2 appealed to me because it has the look of the Apple Watch without the price, but it looks like I will be buying an Apple Watch now because I am so annoyed with this product.",2
1,"Bought this for my hubby for Christmas after buying a cheaper brand and returning that one. This works great, has all the features my man wanted. No issues with the app or watch itself. We are now in competition on steps daily since we both got one. This one came with 2 different bands in multi sizes.",5
0,"This is my 2nd versa 2... both won't keep heat rate accurately after a few months. Spend a bit more and get a better solution... I'll be doing that soon. Too dang much money for these to quit working all the time. (And yes I cleaned the back of the watch... soap, alcohol, nothing works...)",1
0,"Honestly I wanted to like this product so much but I'm having so many problems with it. First the front screen wouldn't display my steps, so I followed the steps to troubleshoot and fixed it. Then it wouldn't display my texts, so I followed the steps to troubleshoot it and fixed it. Then it wouldn't connect with my Spotify account...guess what--followed the steps to troubleshoot it and fixed it. Now it won't let me connect my bluetooth headphones and my Spotify at the same time. Any luck finding how to fix it? Nope. This thing is such a pain to get setup, and the same problems keep happening. If I have to troubleshoot it one more time I'm gonna lose it. Wouldn't recommend. Just spend the extra money and get an iWatch.",2
0,"After about 2 months my original watch's display would only light up green. Fitbit sent me a new watch but the replacement watch only worked for about a month. I sent an email to Fitbit support telling them the watch would not charge, would not sync, would not reset, and would not turn on. Fitbit support sent me an email 7 days later asking me to update my watch! I replied to the email telling Fitbit support that I did not appreciate that they did not read my last email. I told them again that the watch was completely dead and could not be updated or reset. I waited for about another week. Fitbit support finally sent me another email, they asked me to reset my completely dead watch! Instead of waiting for the next unhelpful automated email, I hope that a human being from Fitbit contacts me by commenting on this post. Case reference number #35856425. P.S. The wrist band gave me a rash.",1
1,Ordered this Fitbit watch for a pre-teen grandson’s Christmas gift. He loves it!!!,5
0,Liked the watch. Bought screen protectors and cool nee bands. Showered in it and everything. Couldn’t wait to go swim. Finally went for first swim. Set pool distance and started app. Dove in and swam one lap. Looked at watch face and blank. Tried everything and it was dead. Charged and all. Nothing. Bracelet. I pushed on the screen that night and a drip came out. Not for swimming I guess.,2
0,"I hate everything about this pos. It is uncomfortable to wear. I had cheaper watches that performed better. This watch never delivered a single message or notification no matter how hard i tried to figure what i might be doing wrong. And then just after the return window closed, it could not give me the correct time or date.",1
1,"You cannot beat the value for the money on this. I get alerts fromy phone, can respond to texts, and the tracker and app definitely have me moving more.",5
1,The actual watch is quite big. I like the extra band I ordered in a rose gold. The sleep mode is hard for me to get accurate and I am not sure why.Has a longer charge life than older version. One needs to be diligent with the online app to keep that up to date. It is mostly good for tracking steps and distance. The other options I just do not use much.,4
0,"I will update my review if my issues gets resolved. I LOVE this model and almost everything about it. I mostly got it to track my sleep and apparently a very common issue is the sleep score working/not working. It’s very frustrating. There are many posts online regarding people having this issue. I will be returning this if I can’t find a fix for this soon, as if it doesn’t do what it says, it is defective.",2
1,"Had the charge 2 for a few years and upgraded to the Versa 2 last month. After a month of every day use I can say I love it. No issues, have showered with it a few times but typically take it off to be safe. Bought a fancy black band from amazon to dress it up. Well worth the upgrade from the charge 2.",5
1,The fitbit has been having syncing issues following the most recent Android update. It syncs for about 2 weeks and then will randomly stop until following an arduous troubleshooting process that takes about 30 mins. Fitbit customer support has told me they can do nothing. Considering returning.,3
0,It worked well at first but the got was a but off. It was too bright most of the time even when dim. Ultimately had to return because it wouldn't sync to app. There were issues with it updating information and being updated. Even at prime day price it wasn't worth it. At one point. I even had trouble turning it on and lost everything in a reset.,1
0,Communications between the watch and the app is nonexistent. Can not use to control any cellphone functions . Has apps built into the watch that you can't use until set up on the app on the phone but then there is no communication to finish the set up . The app and the watch are extremely nonuser friendly. Wish I never bought it !!!,2
0,"I was very disappointed in my Fitbit Versa 2, bc it completely died not even a year after I purchased it. I ended up buying another fitness tracker watch, at a local business near me. I’m writing this review now, bc someone who works for Amazon told me I should let the seller know what happened, regardless of the time past.",1
0,"I’ve now had both a Versa and a Versa 2 and both watches died after 15 months of use. In both instances, the screen simply stopped functioning and there was no misuse of the product that would have caused it any damage. In both cases, Fitbit refused to do anything but provide a discount code to purchase another Fitbit device because they were both slightly out of the one year warranty range. While the tracker itself is fine when it’s working, Fitbit has major quality issues and does not stand behind their products.",2
0,"Giving this 2 stars because I love the look of it and its easy to use. However, the measurements are VERY inaccurate. For every mile my treadmill calculated, the Versa only tracked half that. My husband and I both have the versa. When we take walks together, we start the walk at the same exact time, walk the same exact path etc. Our readings never match. I am passed my return date so now I’m stuck with it. Dont waste your money.",2
1,Have purchased fitbits since the first one came out and they only improve. Love it as it helps me get & keep fit. Easy to use and unuse sections of the program. Get questions about it a lot and will always continue to recommend as long as they continue to improve.,5
1,"A big upgrade from my dated timex ironman. Love the intuitive features including pulse tracker, sleep tracker, step counter. It really motivates you to be more fit. You can also download useful applications like a flashlight and other fitness trackers. There are a few things that could be improved including ""ease of use"" - it took me a while to figure out how to install apps. But everything else is great and i figured it out eventually.",5
1,I like the one button operation which I was concerned about before I started using it.It is a little thicker than the Versa.I think the heart rate tracking is more accurate.The battery life is amazing.It is still a great value compared to Apple watch.,5
1,"Using it with iphone. Loving it so far. Mostly use for sleep tracking, step counter and phone, text, email notifications. Don’t care a lot about other apps and Alexa. Worn it swimming a few times without any issues. Heart rates is within +/-2 beats comparing # as reported by exercise machines and calories is also pretty close. Sleep tracking is pretty consistent. Only complaint is that the display doesn’t turn on very consistently when on auto mode.",5
1,"This is my first Fitbit. If actually like it a lot. If like how well it tracks my activity. It syncs with my Cubii, my main machine for exercise. It took some doing to figure out how to track elliptical. I still, however, have not found an explanation for the components of the activity it’s recording. Battery does last a full week which is great. All in all, I’m rather pleased with it.",4
1,Have owned 3 different Fitbit models and used them on a daily basis. Bought the Versa 2 to replace my Versa when the battery died (2+ years). Wish the battery lasted longer but the Versa 2 has similar functionality to the Versa and I prefer it to the Versa 3's setup (and cost). Bought this as an Amazon Daily Deal.,5
1,"When I first ordered this watch, it came shipped to me in an undamaged box but someone (Amazon Warehouse worker) had stolen the watch and left half the wrist band.They corrected this issue ASAP and I got my Fitbit! It works great and I have had no issues with it. Color of the light pink is exactly as shown in the photos. 5/5",5
1,"Enjoying the sleep tracker and the different exercises to monitor either automatically or manually. Enjoying using the Bluetooth notifications of calls and texts from the Android phone, just be aware, the latest Android OS you have on the device, the better, so you can utilize the full features. The steps and calories have helped me realize then even up from the couch or work chair ever so often can make a difference in maintaining device. Alexa feature cool as well, actually can turn a Wemo plug on through my connected watch!",5
0,"If you want constant frustration trying to get this watch synched to your Android device, then knock yourself out. This watch needs to be taken off the market until the bugs are worked out. Very disappointed in my purchase. I gave it 1 star only because it was required.",1
0,"It was stated as “Compatible with iphone 7 plus” it is not! The entire point of getting this was to communicate with my daughter since I can’t have my phone at work. I cannot reply to text messages even with short quick replies. I should have listened to the reviews about it. Also it is a pain in the ass to set up, sometimes it works and sometimes it does not. Returning and getting a apple watch.",1
1,I gave up my Apple Watch and chose the this watch because all my friends have Fitbit. I am very disappointed because the reviews stated I could reply back to messages with this watch. Well it does not work with IOS(iPhones) I found out after I had purchased.that is the only thing I dislike.,4
1,"I love the look of this rose gold watch and its woven navy and pink wrist band. I have had no allergies or rashes on my wrist. I do remove it for showering. I love that it tracks and evaluates my sleep because that is so important for my health. I has alarms, relaxation tips, and more. I'm still learning all the features, but am so happy I chose FitBit Versa 2 for my fitness goals.",5
1,"Not sure how accurate the sleep quality feature is, but it seems pretty close. I haven't used a lot of the apps yet, but there appears to be some very nice apps to install. It's bigger than my Flex 2 was, but it didn't take long to get used to it. The SpO2 blood oxygen sensor matches the SpO2 fingertip reader.",5
0,I loved it while it worked but I've only had it 7months and it is not staying charged now. I charge it fully and within 3hours its dead again!,2
1,"I don't really use smart watches for ALL the features. I love that I can accept or reject calls from my watch, read the full messages and clear them. The battery life is pretty good, 2-3 days is typical. I love the always on feature for the clock. I use the stop watch and timer all the time for coaching and it's very user friendly.",5
1,"I have been using FitBit for years now, since they started selling bands. I have upgraded to the versa 2 recently and am happy with most of the features like the always on display and the different clock faces you can download. I also like the different bracelet bands you can use. The only con I have is that it doesn't track my walks/runs at all. My old Charge would track everytime with my phone's GPS and even though I haven't changed any settings on my phone and GPS is synced, the track feature with the Versa has never worked, so I track my miles with calculating steps myself- a bit tedious. Overall, it's a nice tracker.",4
0,"This was a gift for my daughter. She was SO excited! When working properly, it was a fantastic watch/fitness tracker, but after only four months, the Versa 2 is not holding its charge. We are following directions wrt charging; the watch will fully charge and then, unexpectedly, it will be fully out of charge within the same day it was charged. This is not how the Versa 2 is supposed to work.We have been very impressed with Fitbit products until having this problem. Now I will see how well they stand by their products; I'll be asking for a replacement.",1
1,"I had a HR2, but the screen cracked. They fixed it once, then it cracked again, but was out of warranty. I then bought an ITouch, but it did not seem very accurate and did not have a good sleep tracker. So now I have the Versa 2, it has a glass screen, and I like the fitbit features. I do wish it was a little smaller, I have small wrists.",5
1,"I bought this smart watch specifically for the pandora feature. I spent nearly a week trying to sync my playlists and troubleshooting the possible issues. While looking into this, I found that LOTS of other people seem to have the same issue and there doesn't appear to be any solution. I finally gave up and returned it.",3
0,"The Alexa feature is completely useless. The microphone dies after a month or two. Fitbit replaced one watch already, but now the same thing happened to the second one.Haven't been in water at all, never wear it in the shower, no reason for it to die. It is just a terrible quality component.",2
1,"Someone wrote a book on this watch, but alot of that wasn't true. The sleep feature is off and the health monitoring features are not ALL that. It is soft and attractive, and I like the light to be on all the time, but for $143.00, I need all the features to work.",3
1,"It's a great fitness tracker that quickly connects to Alexa and thus, your Amazon world. It essentially does everything the other top watches does short of calls, which isn't important to me, so I am 100% satisfied. Gorgeous screen and amazing connectivity, plus all week battery life means it is everything its advertised to be and more. Super highly recommended.",4
0,The Versa 2 was receiving text messages and phone calls just fine when I first got it. Then about three weeks ago it stopped getting them. I have followed all fit bit's tips to remedy the problem and nothing works. Maybe $200.00 for a watch is no big thing to some people but I expect something that costs that much to function properly for a lot longer than 5 months!,2
1,Loved my versa lite for over 2 years. I upgraded to a versa 2 and love it. It’s the most accurate tracker I’ve found plus I love bring able to do competitions with friends and family. I bought my husband one a few weeks after having mine too. He used a Garmin before this one and It was constantly missing steps and flights of stairs. He loves his versa 2 too!,5
0,"I've had good, healthy skin for pretty much all of my life. Until this watch entered my life. The back of the watch face somehow manages to corrode the skin over time, leading to some manner of horrible, itchy, flaky, red, inflamed leprosy. At least it's localized to just this specific region, but it's only a matter of time until my entire forearm develops some antibiotic-resistant infection that eventually requires amputation.The good news is that you'll be one of the most well-rested, jacked, and ripped amputees around.",1
0,"I had a charge 2 for years, almost four before it died but never had one problem with it tracking my pulse or my sleep, which is directly related to pulse.I just bought this one and day two and it sporadically picks up my heart rate. Exercise and everything else that I want this for is related to pulse! I had a versa special addition after my charge 3 and same problem. I wouldn’t read my pulse. So disappointed in Fitbit. Because it was my favorite and loved my Charge 3",1
1,"Fitbit Versa 2 is fine. I have owned cheaper models which were not as accurate. However, the constant Fitbit emails and notifications to join a 'Premium' service is annoying. The wrist band was short, so I had to order a longer band. The device itself is fine as stated.",5
1,I had to replace my Versa 1 so I decided to try this new Versa 2 and I ABSOLUTELY love it! Battery lasts me 6 days! Voice to text works perfectly and is so handy. Love the screen faces on this version way better also! Sleep tracking is still iffy some nights but the rest is great. Only thing I haven't done yet is active Alexa on here. If you are looking for a fitness tracker vs smart watch this is the way to go!,5
1,"Great product from Fitbit as usual at an affordable price. Alexa integration is a leap in feature addition.Response time is relatively slow though. It take noticeable time for display to show following a hand motion. You need to speak loud to Alexa which can be a nuisance when done in public or even if you are alone in your office room.Overall, a great value.",5
0,"The screen fell out after a year. The watch never touched more than rain, and fell apart while I was asleep. Their answer is a discount on a new product without any assurance the screen won't just pop out of the next product. No Thank You! I will take my business elsewhere...and you should too, if you want a device that will last more than a year.",1
0,I have had it like two months now. It shuts off or the back still has the green light but then the front will go completely black.. some things not right with it.. I can't use my finger to use the watch properly like to see my steps and whatever else. I literally have to use the app to see anything. It's never been in water other than a splash or two from washing my hands which shouldn't hurt if it is able to be used while swimming. Also the battery doesn't stay charged as long now as when I first started using it. Idk but I'm not too happy after spending over two hundred dollars on a watch that is not working correctly especially within the first month.,1
0,"This watch was great when I first got it and was for a good month. Last month, it started to register my swipes as taps, so I was unable to scroll through the app list. Then it quickly got worse. Sometimes the touchscreen will be completely unresponsive, sometimes I'll tap on one spot and it will register the tap in another spot (this is especially annoying with the quick actions menu). I restarted the device multiple times and even did a full factory reset. This seemed to work for a day or so, then back to the same issues. This was a 5-star watch when it worked, but it's nearly unusable three months after I bought it.",2
1,"Bought the Versa 2 in November, and it stopped holding a charge in January. Exchanged it for a new one, which is perfect. I originally bought the first version in exchange for the Versa 3 because the band is so much more comfortable on my small wrist. The features are excellent!",5
1,"This is the best product that I think that I have ever splurged on myself for. It was a little pricey, but totally worth the expense! I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product! Not one problem and self explanatory in the inner workings of this device! I LOVE how after 2 months of having this product, I have had no issues. I LOVE that you can customize this to fit your personality. You want to some bling, buy some bling for it.",5
0,"Wow these product descriptions are misleading. You can't play Spotify on here! You'll see your playlists and it will let you pause/play/control the music that's playing from a DIFFERENT device. You can't take this running and leave your phone behind and listen to your music (which was what I wanted to do). Plus, the bluetooth linking is spotty at best. This is a fancy step counter masquerading as an apple watch. The best you can do is MANUALLY transfer MP3S from your laptop onto the watch like it's 2009. If you're an Apple Music or Spotify user this won't work for you. Returning this because I'd rather have my money back than stare at this thing that's making me angry. Pretty useless in my opinion. I should have just bought the basic step counter!",1
1,I'm very happy with this purchase. I bought strictly to track my sleep and steps. I have not used the mobile app for it. It's very comfortable and holds a charge well. I have to charge every 3rd day. I have not changed the band so I cannot comment on that. Very happy with this watch.,5
1,I bought this on prime day for about $125. Step accuracy is questionable at times but overall this smartwatch does more than I expected. Love that I can just glance at my watch for notifications.,4
1,Steps and heart rate were initially inaccurate. But appears to improved greatly. I like the sleep and heart monitoring features.,4
0,"I really like FITbits for what they are unfortunately they are constantly messing up. They freeze up, won’t connect or totally die and you have no idea how to get it back on. I feel like I spend more time searching forums for fixes than I do enjoying the FITbit itself. I had kinda high hopes for the Vera2, but I think I should have gone with my gut and got an Apple Watch. Not to mention it was counting “steps” as I drove down a bumpy road.",2
1,"I've found this just doesn't live up to my other workout trackers. The battery dies in two days and all I did was add a simple screen save (not on all the time) and only workout 3 days a week.Pros: Sleep Smart Alarm, Steps seem accurateCons: Can't set running intervals, Distance is not as accurate as my Garmin, Can't control music while exercising",3
1,"The watch is light, the battery life last for at least two days, it can be submerged in the bath tub when I am bathing my 2 year old, it keeps track of my steps, I can connect my credit card and Starbucks card to it, and it also alerts me and lets me answer my phone as well as text messages and emails. I am sure it can do a lot more, but I am still learning.",5
1,"I didn’t even think about the possibility of Nickel in the back of the watch, but sure enough after a few days I developed a major rash- exactly like the one around my finger which my doctor found was a nickel allergy. I am trying to switch arms because I love the watch and all it’s functions, but the rash is painful. And my allergy is light. Read up online and found others. Beware.",3
1,"The watch itself is really great. Not very good at sleep tracking. I have insomnia and it usually registers that time as that I am still asleep but restless. Otherwise, the watch itself is great!The watch band though.... its comfortable. But it broke after only 3 weeks. Because of the way the band connects into the fitbit body, rather than outside the body like normal watches, means the silicon is really thin along the area where the bar snaps the band into the watch. I now have to replace the band. I hope this isn't a trend. That watch is already far more expensive then my pebble watch was. And while it's still not as good as the pebble it is close. But if I have to spend so much money every month replacing a watch band, I am not sure it's worth it.",4
0,"My watch worked great for almost a month and then the screen started becoming unresponsive, eventually it became unusable. When I contacted customer support they walked me through factory data reset and 'setting it up as a new device' again. Nothing has worked and I've been waiting for them to email me back for a couple of days, Anytime I contact support they say they will have to email me and if I send an email I don't get a reply.Currently I have a $200 paperweight that I'm not wearing because it doesn't always log data, I can't do anything on the watch that would make it a 'smartwatch'.",1
1,"I love how it picks up even the slightest movement when I'm walking. I take small steps and my last device wouldn't pick up on all of them, so it wasn't very accurate. I also love the sleep tracking. I thought I was sleeping ok, but would often wake up tired. Now, I know that I am waking up multiple times during the night and I'm also not sleeping as deeply as I should (my dad also did this, so I'm not surprised). This is very helpful!",5
1,I love this watch!! Does everything I needed it to do. And at a price way better than an apple watch I'm more than pleased! I love that it tracks my sleep habits. It sends me reminders to get up and move (I work in an office). Sends me notifications of phone calls and text messages. Syncs with my Google calendar so I miss nothing! Also has my Starbucks app so u can pay for my latte from my watch. Also my favorite part is having a built in Alexa! Whaaaaatttt??? #winning,5
1,"Great interface on watch, excellent iPhone application giving well organized presentation of activity vs. fitness and sleep goals. The watch goes 5-7 days without requiring recharge. I can maintain a fully charged phone by putting watch in charging cradle while showering and shaving each morning (10-15 minutes).",4
0,"Bottom line, my battery is 4 days max and I can't use any apps. I have gone months without updating and syncing. Customer service told me 4 days battery is acceptable to them, even though I use no apps and have turned every feature off... 6+ days is a bold face lie.But hey, if subpar tech is your thing then definitely buy it.",1
1,"For the child (40 years old) that has everything, this Fitbit was a big hit. My daughter and her husband didn't think they would like it but given as a Christmas gift they tried it out and just so happen to absolutely love them.",5
1,"I like the sleep tracking the most. Since I started to wear the Fitbit V2, I have made attempt to sleep longer, and have felt more energy during the day. It helps me tracking daily activity, and in general my activity level has been up. I like the Vera 2 because the watch face is bigger, it is easier to see the health summary at one glance.",5
0,"If you try to switch the band out, expect an onslaught of cursing and screaming. Its nearly impossible. I tried for 30 mins and simply couldn't do it. I gave up and returned the device. There are entire blogs about this issue. Its a disaster",1
1,"If you research Fitbit sleep sync, you'll find they have had issues at least going back to 2016 with this feature. Fitbit still can't figure out how to make this stable. So you have to go through some steps to get it to sync again. I have to do it everyday. It's annoying. I had another Fitbit and had the same problem. When it's time to upgrade, I'll pick a different Fitness tracker.",3
1,"This seems far more sensitive than it should be. I noticed that if I shake my arm, I add more steps😡. Also, for the price, a protective cover should be included. Sleep tracking...haven't noticed yet. It took ages and a new phone to make it work. It's only two days old, so I'll update later.",4
0,I bought this in May 2021 and now it will not hold a charge. I didn’t get the protection plan(my fault) obviously because I loved Fitbit so much and upgraded to a better version so I thought. Where/ what is the address so that I. An send this back to Amazon?,1
1,"I previously was using the fitbit charge, and I wanted an upgrade that was capable of more features! This was the perfect fit for me! I love the apps and the tracking capabilities. The battery life drains a little more quickly than I'd prefer, but that also is due to my brightness settings and my screen timeout preferences.. I end up charging it everyday while I shower though, so it hasn't presented a problem :). Love, love, love this product!",5
1,"This is my second fitbit due to my first one after almost 2 years decided to almost explode due to the battery getting hot while charging.Only complaint I have is I can't count try steps while shopping and pushing a cart.Other then that I lovethe facts can answer my phone, reply to texts get calendar notifications while my phone isn't near me.",4
0,"Versa 2 was the first watch I got.It worked great despite regular app and sync issues.Versa 2 started having issues after 12 month warranty where it would not power on.I reached out to Fitbit but they could not resolve the issues.They could not offer replacement b/c I was just out of warranty; however they did offer discount coupon to buy new Fitbit device.Based on Fitbit's community forums and other website, it seems like it is very common for Fitbit device to fail near 12 month warranty period.",1
0,"The first picture where I’m wearing acrylic nails, I woke up with the screen detached about 9 months after owning. The second picture happened within 6 months of the replacement. Thank God I bought the extended warranty. Don’t know what happened. Just woke up to the screen broken off",1
0,"Worst customer service I've ever dealt with. The heart rate stopped tracking after 6 months (would just have a line, no reading at all), and it took THREE calls to customer service before they agreed to send me a replacement. The replacement arrived after an entire MONTH and it is cracked and won't even turn on. They made me send pictures of the damage and I still don't have a working fitbit. Totally disappointed. My husband had an issue with his Garmin watch (some hardware malfunction) and he had a totally new one within a week, new wristbands, charger, everything. I won't be buying fitbit again.",1
1,Works great with my Humana Insurance Go365 program to automatically record my steps to earn incentive rewards. Motivates me to keep moving. The nylon band did not work well for me so i ordered an inexpensive leather one from Amazon. It is narrow and less irritating to my skin.,5
0,I've had the FitBit Versa 2 for 5 months and it was doing good then the face popped off last week. It still works but at times the face freezes. And of course I didn't get the Protection Plan so I've lost money on this one. Really not impressed with FitBit. This watch didn't even make six months before it fell apart.,2
1,Very nice watch. Lots of cool featuresBut for some reason. I cannot receive text messages on this watch. It will notify me of a call but not a text. I don’t know if this is Apple thing or software thing.,3
0,"The media could not be loaded.
 Lasted five months and then stopped working. Would not recommend.",1
0,"The Versa 2 was easy to set up and was working well up until the day it died, 10 months later. I was having some touch screen problems that resolved after 3 to 4 days. The Fitbit Versa 2 was under warranty (1 year) and they are replacing it.",2
0,Exactly 30 days i purchased fitbit 2 and the battery couldnt work for more than 2 hours a day. Its nothing but a waste of time and money. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT. Its overrated!,2
1,"I'm a big fan of the versa watch. I have a versa 2 for my girlfriend and myself. We constantly use the steps, heartrate, sleep tracker, and the actual watch time. The Fitbit community, once you interact with real people, is really dope as well. Step challenges, blogging, and interacting with random people around the world is dope.The watch looks good as well & battery life is killer.However, the extra apps that come on the watch go very unused. The Alexa function isn't very good in my opinion. I suppose the versa 1 would be more reccomend by me at the end of the day.",5
0,"Fitbit is super easy to use and device was great. Unfortunately this product died with the Fitbit emblem of death on the screen and has not revived after exhausting every self help tip on Amazon, YouTube, Google, Fitbit forum option. This was my wife's 3rd fitbit, but it seems we will be upgrading to a nicer watch in the future.",1
1,"I decided to try this before buying an Apple Watch because I really only wanted a fitness tracker for when I run. It’s super cute & light weight and I was so excited when I opened the box, but the strap on mine kept popping off & my fingernails were destroyed and bleeding trying to put it back on. My boyfriend tried to and he struggled too. I worked at a watch store and it shouldn’t be that difficult. I also don’t think the app is very user friendly. The watch itself is really easy to figure out but setting up on the app is kinda silly the way it is laid out. I returned and decided to spend the extra money on an Apple Watch.",3
0,"It didn't even last a year before it began not syncing. First it stopped syncing sleep only. Within a few months it wasn't syncing anything. Tried everything to fix, even calling fitbit. Luckily I had bought the insurance and was able to get my money back.",1
1,"The watch looks nice. However, it is difficult to fit my wrist well. It either very loose or very tight. The distance between holes is not good for my wrist. Maybe because my wrist is too small while the watch is big, making it not looking nice on my wrist.",3
0,the straps keep coming loose it comes off my arm at night and sometimes I can be sitting there and it straps is automatic come loose and watch falls off! they got to fix thisI wish it stop tracking steps while I'm driving or sitting at my desk!! They have to improve this!,2
1,"Watch looks good and does what I. Mneed it to do well. There is a simple “always on mode”. It vibrates with a phone call or text. You can easily read texts. There are a lot of faces available , but not many. classic ones. Eassy to pair. Haven’t used many apps.",5
0,"I wish I could give this product a great review, however I spent hours trying to change the smaller wrist strap to the larger. Next I wanted to change the face orientation but could not. I spent well over three hours with this thing and have no yet had time to set it up. I gave it one start anticipating that some part of the mechanics will wok, Would not buy again or recommend the Fitbit to others. Silly two easy fixes and the first thing your customer encounters is a negative",1
0,Why would I spend $178 on a fitness watch that doesn’t have GPS? If I had to carry my phone to track miles I would not need a watch. I can access Alexa and music on my phone. Once again I have no need for this watch. I’m returning this “watch”.,1
1,"While I sit, I get alerts that I am taking steps... Not happy either to discover that I have to pay either $10 monthly or $80 a year for the privilege of in-depth sleep tracking. I'll consider buying an Apple Watch instead in the near future.",3
1,"No it doesn't do what an apple watch would, BUT for the price it does enough. My steps, my exercise, my water intake, my sleep. I do receive notifications and alerts. Very stylish, battery lasts forever! I have an iphone X and I've had no problems connecting with it or keeping it connected. Love the variety of bands that is offered. This watch will be with me for a while. Love it",5
0,"I had to replace the first one because of inaccuracy.All readings were inaccurate. Tried factory reset, amd fitbit never came back on. Was completely dead. I decided then to return it.The new replacement is a little better, but still inaccurate. Heart rate, which is the most important one is extremely inaccurate.For instance, I was working out on a cardio machine and elevated my heart rate to 150. I looked at Versa 2 screen and it read my heart rate as 75.Other times, it does the opposite and it read my hart rate as faster then it is. Makes me feel like I’m having a heart attack!Very disappointed and will return item.",2
1,"Bought this for my girlfriend. Thought I was tech savvy but had to read on its functionality. It’s a little quirky at first to get music apps installed, to playback. You must have your phone nearby as all apps run through phone. Not a standalone device. It tracked her sleep one night but she wasn’t wearing it. Still trying to understand that. Other than that seems to work fine for texting, emails, notifications.",4
1,"Love this watch! Alexa is a great new function added to it. Works well. Responses back are in text format. I had a slight skun reaction to the silicone band, almost like a slight burn, but i took off the watch immediately and it healed quickly. I put the watch back on and havent had another issue like that. Its been 2 weeks, so im hoping it doesnt happen again. I really love the original watchband, its soft and comfortable. I purchased the stand charger separately, and that works really well, its super easy to attach the watch to charge.",5
1,"This Fitbit made me more active, made me more aware of sleep, breathing and the fact I had a rapid heartbeat which now meds control. I can print out my stats for all of this and bring to dr visits. A lot of information available if you want to use it. The only con is because I have Apple phone cannot use watch to answer calls, I can answer but ppl cannot hear over watch. May work w android phones though.",5
0,"I bought for my daughter for Christmas. The watch I bought her completely died and the screen looked like a snowy tv station. After I spent an hour (and 3 dropped calls) with product support from India, they send me a new watch. My daughter had it on for about 8 hours then went to change the band and saw the burn on her wrist. The watch was the only thing on her wrist at that time. The burn was there for 3-4 days. Needless to say.. I sent it back, no thanks!!!",1
1,"This is an ideal watch , love it. BIG FLAW!! The charging system sucks. You have to fight with it for hours and then when you think you’ve finally got it, it’s not charging. My friend has a versa 2 ( not special addition) the back is shaped differently and it works on the same charger with just a little accuracy.If you don’t mind waiting 18 hours for your watch to charge then there’s no problem but me I’d rather be wearing the watch.",5
0,"Requires “Premium” subscriptions to both Spotify and Pandora accounts in order to utilize these options at all. Fitbit app or Alexa app must run (stay open) in background of in order to use Alexa, presenting potential low cell battery concerns. Very few other apps are available to use with this device.",1
0,"I haven't had it a year yet and for no reason like dropping or bumping it, just plain wearing it, the screen started to come off. I had it fixed with an adhesive but a few days later. I was back putting scotch tape on it. Now, it just completely will not come on even though the light behind the watch is bright as ever. Now what??? I'm afraid to buy another one!!",2
1,Really like this. Do not like that it doesn't show heart rhythm. This was helpful in my gear fit as it showed it right on the band and showed when my heart was falling out of rhythm again.Also the Alexa capability has to have the app open and running in the background. So if you're phone is on a battery saver or lock screen that won't work.,4
0,"I loved for the first three months, I had replaced my first fitbit with this. After three months I now have no display. It apparently still tracks on my app, but I cant see anything but a white screen on my watch. I tried shutting it completely down, but nothing works. I will buy another fitbit from a store.",2
0,"Purchased this for my husband to be able to see texts while at work. First off it was very difficult to get texts to come through, between the fitbit app and his iPhone notifications needed to be turned on in about 4 places which was very frustrating to figure out. After a year of use the battery completely dies after about an hour of use after fully charging. Seems like this product should last longer than a year. Very disappointed wouldn't buy this product again",1
1,I had the first Fibit versa and it stopped working after a year. So I was able to get this one on sale durning Prime days and it is amazing!! I also got the extended warranty just in case but I bought that threw Fitbit. But I love the Fitbit watches and they are even better when you get them on sale.,4
1,"When I first got it, it would stop sending me texts DAILY and I would have to mess with the watch and app and my phone to make it work. When it finally started working properly, it stopped allowing me to voice text my text replies. Fail. And I frequently get my 10,000th step while washing my hands or brushing my teeth.",4
0,The screen is unusable. It won't allow me to open any window except with power button. Sometimes after turning off and on again it will temporarily fix the problem. I've tried factory resetting it 2 times. It's been going on for a couple months now. I'm quite sick of it. Im not sure if it's a software problem or if it's something else but I'm upset because now its nothing but something that can tell me what time it is........ I can buy a 5$ watch at Walmart that can do that!!!! Luckily it syncs to my phone still or I'd want a full refund as I expect a product this expensive to work properly when I haven't even had it for 6 months. I haven't gotten it wet besides hand washing.,2
1,It was time to upgrade from my old fitbit and decided to go with the the Versa 2. Love the varied features and am still getting to know what exactly this fitbit will do. Can't believe I can have music on my wrist! Also find the recharging process to be MUCH faster than my previous model plus the battery last longer!,5
1,"I absolutely love my fitbit. This is the 4th one that I purchased. Only change up due to style and capabilities. I have attached the app where I can receive my text messages on the watch and I love the sleep app because it keep track of the sleep that I apparently am not getting enough of. Overall great product, you will not be disappointed",5
1,"I love it! It's cute, comfortable, and works really well! Having to have it connected via bluetooth runs my battery down on my phone but other than that it's a pretty neat watch. I like that it reminds me to stay active throughout the day and it has a neat feature that reminds you to breathe and it walks you through a breathing technique that helps you relax.",5
1,"Its ok. I'm not thrilled with it. Sometimes it tracks my sleep, other times not. The steps are not accurate. The battery life is only ok. Not thrilled with it but I'll wear it.",3
1,"I love my Fitbit. I had Fitbit’s for years, then changed to an Apple Watch. After 3 days I returned the Apple and went back to Fitbit. I missed my daily challenges so much!!! Fitbit gives me sleep insights, fitness insights, motivates me, and helps me during the day. I’m also a beta tester, which I really enjoy. I feel like my input helps to make a better watch for YOU!!!",5
1,"I had a couple issues getting there settings right at the start. I had to go into settings in the Fitbit to take it out of sleep mode. It wasn't buzzing for any alerts except alarms. I still haven't tried to put music on it. Otherwise, I basically love it! No issues with scratching as I've seen online. I sometimes put a cover on just to clean house.",5
1,I love my new watch it's amazing having alexa built in. I get busy doing hair in my salon and I tap my button and ask when is my next appt. I have my square appointments synced to my google calendar and it will read me my calender for the day. I also have kids and they will text and I can read it thru the watch without stopping to pick up the cell. I also can respond back ( talk to text),5
1,"I absolutely love it! I use it ro track my steps because I can earn money through a program at work for them. I track my heart rate, and my sleep pattern in hopes of improving how I sleep.I have had 3 other similar devices (fitbit, max buzz, Samsung gear fit) and this is the best by far!!! And having Alexa on it is a great bonus!",5
0,purchased this Fit Bit Versa 2 watch Nov. 2019 and 1 year and 2 months (just when warranty expires) it dies and will not charge. I was offered a 35% discount to purchase a new one but why would anyone want a product that is unreliable and only lasts one year.Note I have a cousin who also had a Fit Bit Versa 2 and his also stopped charging after only 1 year.,1
1,"My wife loved her Fitbit Versa 2. Just be prepared to x=charge your cell phone more often, as the communication between the two seems to have a big impact on battery life of the cell phone, but the Versa lasts about 5 days without having to charge it.",4
1,Not sure why this watch doesn’t sync with the app automatically without me opening it. I have it set in settings to update in the background so I don’t know. Syncing is very slow too. And heart rate while running isn’t constant. Same performance as Fitbit versa 1 - I just really love the battery life and how fast it charges.,4
1,"I wasn't sure if I'd like wearing this watch because it is larger than any watch I've ever worn, but I love it. It reminds me to exercise, and I really like the sleep monitoring function. I don't generally sleep well, and thia helps me understand why I'm so tired all the time. I hope I won't need to, but I'd get this again if something happened to it.",5

0,"I have had 4 Fitbits: the first 2 were great, I just wanted an upgrade. The third was a Charge 3 on which the screen died after 26 months. I expected it to last longer, but again I wanted the upgrade. So I bought the Versa 2. Then after 14 months, it's stuck on the home screen. I can't swipe. Fitbit's response: here's a coupon for 35% off a new one. I just want one that lasts.",1
1,"I got help from ""Chat Now"" at Fitbit website. The person helping me was excellent. He walked me thru the process and at the end, my Versa 2 still could not sync with the phone app. He initiated to send me a replacement and that was yesterday. Today I got a confirmation email that the replacement has been sent. Excellent customer service!",5
1,"I like it. It really shows you your sleep patterns and will log your calories and wayer. Knows every step I take.Good alarm too! All in all, it works well. Kinda sucks that they want 10.00 more for a subscription..... MONTHLY.Forget that. It should be included",5
1,Have to sync the watch four or fives times to have it update my sleep. Watch face changes on its own. Sometimes notifications don’t go through. Very cool watch and has made tracking my fitness journey an overall breeze. But the watch is just glitchy. For the price I’d have expected a little bit of a higher quality. But it does what it’s designed to do.,3
1,I love it!! It synced right away with my android phone. I was having trouble with notiicationss but found out it was set on Do Not Disturb. Now it works great and vibrates with each nitification! LONG battery life. Easy to use and read!! I highly recommend this product!!,5
0,"I really wanted an accurate heart rate monitor. This thing is off by more than 20bpm regularly. Support just keeps telling me to factory reset. Be prepared for that whole process. Also, my text notifications and calls do not show up like they should. The solution for that? Factory reset!! Search these issues and research before you buy, it's not just me. This watch is a joke. 2 stars instead of 1 for appearance, I get told regularly that my apple watch looks dope.",2
1,"I received the Versa 2 six days prior to its promised delivery day. So far, it is a jewel. Prior to ordering it (family’s gift for Mother’s Day), I YouTubed reviews between Apple and Fitbit Versa 2 watches. I own a charge 2, so I’ve been using Fitbit App’s since then. I didn’t like that Apple Watch had so many apps. Fitbit is the keeper, so far.",4
0,"I bought this specifically for heart rate monitoring while exercising. Its junk. Very rarely is it accurate and that is momentarily to say the least.Yes. I've tried restarting it, updating it, repositioning in on my wrist, swit hing wrists! You name it.

0,"Worst watch I've ever bought. Stopped working after 11 months. Had to start a return. Took 22 days to get back to their warehouse. When they got it, they just sent the same watch back.

1,"Don't get me wrong. She works out 4 days a week at 5:30 am, (for years), this just made her more obsessed...maybe I'm pretty smart after all. Now she wants to make sure she hit's her goal every day (covid-19) and keep up with ""Marley"" and his Whistle gps/fitbit. The only reason for 4s on sleep tracking and accuracy is because we don't have enough info yet, but she thinks it's it's pretty accurate so far. Facts, baby, facts.",5
1,No need to spend all the money on a trendy “smart watch” and not use all the features anyway.If you are looking for a reliable fitness tracker at one third the price of that produced by a “fruit” company; then get a Versa 2.,5
0,"Beyond disappointed with my Fitbit experience and I can confidently say I will never own one again. The tracker never seemed to be very accurate, syncing took forever and most apps didn’t work like they should. As if that isn’t enough just after owning it barely over a year the heart rate monitor completely quit working. VERY expensive price tag for a product not made to last. The solution of the company was to send me a discount code, but why would I want to dump more money into another watch that would most likely not last beyond a year again? Save yourself from wasting money and choose a different brand!",1
1,"It’s all that it’s advertised to be. Good smart watch with decent looks. But after three weeks the Versa 2 has lost connection with my phone multiple times. The “fix” requires that you completely remove the Versa 2 from the app, only to discover it again just as it were the very first use. So frustrating.",3
1,"Mobile app is easy so far. Have to search around to find and understand things but it gets easier. I haven’t used the sleep tracking as I don’t find the bracelet comfortable or small enough to sleep in. I think the accuracy is spot on, I have counted my steps with the hourly countdown to make sure.",5
0,very unhappy with the battery life and clock face that keeps changing to the wrong date. i have called fitbit twice and although they are very nice on the phone they did not solve my issues. sent me a link to read about how to deal with the battery on line. had an earlier fitbit which i loved but am very very unhappy with the Versa 2. read carefully before making the purchase - get an apple watch!,1
0,"Unfortunately I get a rash every time I wear it. These pics were taken 22 hours after taking it off, washing it and treating it. Fitbit - please step up and make a band that doesn't do this to people's wrists. I cant use this watch and cant return it which is super unprofessional.",2
0,"I did my research and was very excited to purchase the Fitbit Versa 2 watch. I average 5-9 miles of walking a day and was ready to track different routes. I started to realize my mileage was not accurate as I have tracked my routes with my car. They were off anywhere from 3/10 of a mile to a mile. Countless emails to support for help and my mileage is still off. My wife and daughter both have Apple watches and the mileage aligned with my clocked route by my car. I am very frustrated with support. The moral of my story, Fitbit is a great looking watch but if you want to track your route with accuracy, look for another watch. I made a mistake.",1
1,Bought it for my mother who is turning 56 and started to slow down. This watch has motivated her to walk more and to be more healthy. I would highly recommend this for someone that needs a little motivation.,5
1,"If you’re a Fitbit fan you won’t be disappointed with the Versa 2. I’ve had mine about a week and love it so far. It seems to be accurate keeping my step count and sleep pattern, heart rate. There are ALOT of free clock faces to choose from. On 2 occasions it wouldn’t sync with my iPhone but following instructions from Fitbit community website, it synced right away.",5
1,"Battery started to die after a few months and won’t hold a charge for more then a couple hours, then died completely. Might try Apple this time.",5
0,"The product worked well for the first month or so then stopped syncing with my Galaxy S10 phone message app - the single most important feature to me. It syncs with Gmail most of the time but not always. It's as though the watch falls asleep and forgets to sync. Selecting options to sync Outlook and Accuweather to sync does nothing. Spoke with Fitbit support who said to watch for an app update. Really not happy with that answer. The Alexa feature is entertaining but connectivity is very sensitive. I like the fitness features, heart rate monitor, sleep tracker. I liked the ability to reply to text messages using my voice - when that feature was working. If this feature cannot be fixed in the next month I am shopping for a different watch.",2
0,"When it worked, it was great. Two months after purchase Alexa stopped working. I tried everything all the way up to factory reset and different phones. Still no go, and to be honest, Alexa was the feature that got me to buy it. I do the support via chat and they're supposed to get back to me. 3 weeks later and I've still heard nothing. I call their support. They go through their script, not listening when I tell them I've tried it all. I e-mail and threaten legal action since they don't appear to be backing their warranty. That finally gets a response and they email me a shipping label to send it back. I send it in and two weeks now I'm without my device and looking at another week probably before I get it back. I checked their community forums. It looks like the built in microphones that allow Alexa to work fail more than they should. Horrible support. Buy at your own risk.",2
1,"LOVED THE WATCH, BUT DIES AFTER 2 MONTHS. I CONTACTED FITBIT AND THEY ARE REPLACING UNDER WARRANTY BUT DISAPPOINTED IT IS DEFECTIVE ALREADY. THIS IS MY 2ND FITBIT AND I'D LOVE BOTH, JUST BUMMED IT DIES ALREADY BUT SO HAPPY WITH FITBITS CUSTOMER SERVICE!!",3
1,"I love this fitbit! I started my weightloss journey seriously in January 2020 however, when I received this I then knew how hard to workout. I am a visual person and I have managed to lose 20+ pounds. The downside I found is that they want me to go premium which is a little costly to have some of the features that are offered.",5
1,"Still learning some of the things the versa can do (I have had the charge.and charge 3 but It lost the color in clock face after a year) love that it has the swim app and is waterproof. Easy to read, lights up well. Had it 2 weeks. I do always change bands out with the stainless steel magnetic bands. More comfy then the plastic bands. The battery last about 5 days, easy large charging clip.",4
1,Great device. Love my hussy for buying it! The motivators to be active is welcomed and Alexia makes it easy to set reminders and check on your orders among other things. Deducted one star because initial setup said I couldn't use my Samsung J7 with the device. It just refused to link! I bought a new phone completed setup then low and behold it syncs with my old phone too...,4
0,"When I first got the watch I tried to connect for about 1.5 days (literally 40-50 times throughout the day). I gave it a last shot as I was packing it up to send back and it want through. I was initially really excited. Now I wish it hadn't synced so I would have just sent it back. I bought the watch partially for the fitness tracking but I also wanted the notification alerts. The notification alerts are so spotty and unreliable. The watch is fine, I just do not think it is worth $200.",2
0,"First two months it worked fine, after that the watch started crashing and the touch screen wouldn’t work. I purchased it internationally and they don’t have customer support for these kind of issues overseas. It’s a shame because it really could be a good product for sports and fitness but I didn’t do a deep research about the reviews and after experiencing the first signs of problems I went into Fitbit’s website and it turned out this is a common issue lots of people have experienced. However the only solution is to send a replacement ( which makes no sense because it’s very likely to have the same issue later down the road)I bought the Fitbit on amazon and of course the window time for returning has closed even though I bought In February :)A very nice disposable product! And not recommended",1
1,My husband needed a replacement Fitbit and this was a great replacement for an older model. The battery life on the Fitbit is great unlike my Samsung Active that I have to charge every single day!,5
1,"I've had my FitBit for a month. Receiving text notifications were iffy, sometime I would & sometimes it wouldn't work. I would randomly get notifications that I had completed a task, when I hadn't. It finally wouldn't turn on, except for the Timer showing. I ended up returning it.",3
1,"It stays charged forever, you are able to control your music with ease. I haven't used the built in Alexa but the catch is you have to keep the app open on your phone in order to use alexa or even the fitbit app. You are able to change the background on your watch and challenge anyone else who has a fitbit. It makes working out",5
1,I have always been an avid Fitbit user. I purchased this as my first smartwatch to see if it’s something I can get use to. It’s ok. My issue is that it doesn’t track my usage on the treadmill. I literally have to put it in a u mentionable place for it to count with that doesn’t track my heart rate so it defeats the main purpose of me using it.,3
1,A great little wrist device. Includes blood ox tracking. I had a wonderful moment where I had the watch and headphones on and answering was seamless. I loved it. step tracking and calorie counting told me why I lost so much weight once I had a proper pain meds. Battery life seems shorter then expected. Or maybe I move around too much?,5
0,"Ordered this for my daughter for a Christmas present, just over 4 months ago. The product was not abused in any way. The touch screen stopped working and I was not able to reset it or do anything to get the Fitbit working again. Seems like a vey short time for this product to stop working. I searched the internet for a fix but found the many other people have the same problems with this version of the Fitbit.",1
0,"It never synced, never alerted me of calls or texts like my sons does. It was quirky n unreliable. Tried reaching out to customer service but they were useless. Won’t buy again.",1
1,I wanted a fitness tracker to help me meet my fitness goals. This has been great. Very accurate heart rate monitoring. Monitors all my workouts. Sleep tracker sometimes doesn't capture the entire time I am asleep but can be easily edited to the correct times. Really helps me monitor my workouts better.,5
0,"I love Fitbit, and I’ve been using their products for years. But, I’m really disappointed in this one. I bought 2 Fitbit Versa 2s, and I just received them. The description says that the screen size is 1.34 inches. THIS IS WRONG! The screen size is actually 1 inch and the rest is just a border. The screens edges are also pointed which doesn’t look good with the rounded edges.Having paid so much, I’m really disappointed and it was not worth it…",2
0,"I have had several fitbits and I'm aware of the connectivity issues with them. This is by far the worst of them all. Starting with ""updating software."" Which took over an hour (plugged in btw) then it couldn't find my wifi, then it showed up on my bluetooth but wouldn't pair. I've been screwing around with it for an hour and now it's saying dead battery...after an HOUR",1
1,"Product delivered in original packaging, works well with mobile app, accurate on steps and sleep (not so much on flights of stairs). I see no difference in the battery life from this and my original Versa. Will not be using Alexa or payment option, so I could have gone with the original Versa. My only ding is that there is no difference in battery life per the many reports out there.",5
1,"I finally upgraded from my Fitbit blaze. So glad I did! There are so many more advancements on this! If you’re familiar with Fitbit super easy to figure out and transfer your data. Not a fan of the band, ordered another one, but love my versa 2. Tracks everything I want it to and more. Super motivational to stay in shape.",5
0,Falls apart and didn't last at all... 2 year warranty offered outside of USA. They give US buyers a measly 1 year warranty.,1
1,I love this watch it helps me keep track of my sleep my workouts and the battery last for a couple of hours. I can wear it starting at 7am to 4pm and still has about 45% left. Its comfortable to sleep with and it also has an alarm to wake me. I'm still learning all the apps but so far Iove it.,5
0,"Battery life after ten months of limited use of settings is unacceptable. Battery is gone is less than two days even with using Fitbit clock face, turning off text messages and never used for music. This is my third Fitbit and I won’t buy another one.",1
1,"I actually liked it quite a bit as far as fit/finish goes. My wife loves hers and it works great. For whatever reason, the heart rate and sleep monitoring features almost never worked on my wrist. When they did, I had to wear the watch in the strangest positions - which made me not want to wear it. It works and is accurate for my wife, but for my wrist - it failed.",3
0,Only had watch for little more than 8 months. Had Battery issues from day one but it just died. Blank screen. I paid extra and for $140 or so I would expect it to last longer. June 2020 to April 2021 ... Get life. If you have money to throw away then buy this product! It will be a nice money Pit!,2
0,"I brought this watch mainly because it HAD Alexa on it & I needed that app. Less than 2 wks later Alexa doesn't work anymore & the app isn't available anymore for the watch, so disappointed 😞",2
1,I really like this fitness tracker/watch. The rose gold is I very pretty color and feminine. The sleep tracker is so nice to have but it's nice quite accurate. The times is says I go to bed and rose in the morning are often inaccurate. The silicone/plastic band is sweaty and irritating. I purchased a cloth/nylon band from Amazon for $17 which is so much better.,4
0,"I am so disappointed. I had to get a new phone, Samsung A71 5G. My Versa2 is not compatible. I did not know that when I purchased my phone, I assumed since it worked great on my old samsung galaxy that it would be fine on my new one. It did do every thing right before I got my new phone. I loved how well it worked. I no longer care for the fit bit brand.",1
1,"This is an excellent fitness watch. Receive text messages from my phone and tracks your fitness. Battery life is long, and the price is reasonable. Recommended purchase.",5
0,"So annoying to set up, wouldn't connect to my phone or Bluetooth headphones. Uninstalled and reinstalled the app MULTIPLE times, still wouldn't work. Wouldn't connect to Bluetooth, such an awful product ill never buy fitbit again",1
1,"My favorite feature is the alarm ""smart wake"" feature. You set the alarm and the watch will vibrate to wake you up at a time within a 30 minute window where your sleep cycle is not disrupted. It won't wake you up when you are at your deepest sleep.Basically when it detects that your kind of awake. It helps me so much to not wake up extra groggy. Other features are great as well. I would recommend a case cover to protect from basic scratches.",5
1,"I love my Fitbit Versa 2 - now! I returned my first one, because it wasn't tracking my sleep or pulse, no matter how many resets and restarts I made. Once I had the replacement, I once agin found that it didn't track my sleep or heart rate. I figured that it was a defect in the Fitbit Versa - but remembered an article I read years ago about tatoos interfering with monitors. I Googled that, and found out that the HR monitor on the back may mnot ork with tatoo ink - and I have a wrist tattoo. The fix is putting an epoxy disc over the sensor - works like a charm! But Fitbit should warn people about this!",4
1,"I've had this for about 7 months and it barely holds a charge for 24hours. I have since stopped using it and am not able to return it, they only give you a 1 month return window.... However I purchased one for my mother at the same time and hers seems to be holding a charge for 2-3 days. I wouldn't recommend anyone purchase this item!",5
0,"This is the 2nd Fitbit Versa-2 I have purchased for my wife. The 1st one was dead within 9 months, Fitbit sent us a replacement head and it lasted about 8 months. I purchased her another one in May 2020, and right now it is dead and will not reset. I have been fumbling with it for about a week off and on, checking help sites and trying the suggestions, all to no avail. Checked my Amazon account for the date that it was order and found that I am 4 days past the return date. Will not buy another!",1

I decided to upgrade to a Versa 2 when it went on sale during this past black friday sale and gave my Blaze to my little sister and completely regret it, as it is now discontinued. My Versa is less than a year old and for the past couple months now the touch screen has stopped working which is completely frustrating. I contacted them about it and they just had me keep restarting it until it worked again and that only lasted for less than a day before it started malfunctioning again. My stats are still recorded but if i want to see them I have to sync my phone. The only feature I can access is the clock, the touch screen will not respond at all. Very disappointing",2

1,"Loved it but I wish they would have added an emergency button. I am older and live alone so I ended up getting an apple watch, because it has that feature. I really, really liked the fitbit better.",5
0,I’m so disappointed. I was so excited for this produce. I’ve never had a smart watch and I finally pulled the trigger and bought this one because I loved the look of it and it was well reviewed.... It worked so well for a week. Literally one week. Then it died and won’t wake back up. I even bought a new charger for it hoping that it was just a faulty charger. Nope. Still nothing. I wore it for literally one week. Didn’t get it wet. Didn’t crush it or smash it. Didn’t over use it. There’s no logical reason why it wouldn’t work. Very frustrating. :( Not sure what to do but return it,1
1,Easy to read and good tracker,5
0,"I purchased this watch in September,it’s been only 5 months and it barely works. I can’t use the touch screen, it shuts off randomly and doesn’t stay charged very long like it did when I purchased it. Also the easy pay never worked with my bank. I feel like my money was wasted. I haven’t gotten it wet or anything to make it act this way, I’ve taken amazing care of my watch.",1

0,"Pro's the battery life is great! Con's, a few weeks after purchasing, text translation and Alexa quit working. After spending hours on the phone with fitbit support, they had to ""submit a ticket"" for support. Now 3 weeks later, still nothing. Also disappointed in the amount/types of apps that work, however that is something I could have known before purchasing, so that one is on me! :(",2
1,"The pretty pink band makes me breakout. I swabbed it with rubbing alcohol, washed it with soaps and water but the buckle area causes an itchy red rash. I've never had a metal allergy so I do not know what is going on with this product but I cannot wear it with this band because this happens every time I wear it.",3

Here's what she likes:Battery life is superb lasting two days and more.Easy to set up.Tracks her sleep and gives her a report.Attractive and has easy change bands.Customizable faces.Coming from an Apple watch, she is very pleased with the FitBit Versa 2.She recommends it!",4
1,"The Fitbit Versa 2 is absolutely a five-star purchase. I have a Fitbit charge 2. But I wanted something more up-to-date and after reviewing the Fitbit Versa 2 I am glad that I decided to go with it. I still use my charge 2 during the day if I need to charge my Versa 2. I use my Fitbit Versa 2 mainly for the sleep tracking, heart rate and steps. The Fitbit mobile app is wonderful, it really helps you keep up with your activities and also the information about sleeping is very good. Fitbit app also explains to you everything that it is giving you a report of. The battery life on the Versa 2 is unheard of long, 5 to 6 days!",5

1,"I went from Fitbit charge 2, then to an Apple Watch and now the Fitbit verse 2. I love this watch does everything that I need. All functions are clear. Battery last 4 days plus. Very responsive and accurate. Larger face than Apple Watch. Just a great buy if fitness is your plan.",5
0,Absolute garbage. I was excited i opened the box. I had the app already and I went to update the watch and I’ve been trying for hours. It won’t update via wifi. It took an hour to download on Bluetooth and i thought it was finished the app said “please update”. I figured I’d give Fitbit another try after how crappy their surge was.

1,Good fitness watch. Got it for the wife for a Christmas present she likes it got it to replace her old fit bit versa with this one she can use her other wrist bands with this one,5
1,"I like that you can add some apps to your smartwatch. What I don't like is that the fitbit versa 2 app does not always sink with the watch like it should. It just might be mine, due to slow internet. In order to keep track of everything from your watch you have to always have wifi connected to your watch. Another thing I didn't like was the spotify, in order to use it on your watch it wants you to upgrade to spotify premium, which cost money. I use this watch to track my health and fitness, that's why I mainly purchased the smartwatch!",5

The only problem is the Versa2 i got on Feb. 20 2020 is not very unresponsive to touch on the screen quite often will not wake up and at many points during the day will not allow me to scroll through the menu. It will not respond in many different situations. I was told by Fitbit to send it back with the label they supply while they wait to receive the watch back, check it out and then send me a new watch or whatever they decide to do next. I spent my money, once they see the return I should receive my new watch. I am under warranty so I believe I should get this handled quickly. 7-10 business days after receiving the item and after having me send it back regular ground shipping (an additional 3-5 days) and I am not clear as to what will happen next. Amazon PLEASE HELP!!!!!",2
1,Absolutely love my Fitbit versa 2. The screen is very clear in all lighting situations. I love that I can customize the clock face. There are lots of apps that I can use on the watch. I have an iPhone so I cannot reply to a message but the messages that come across the screen are very clear. The band was super easy to change.,5

0,"I was deciding between the Apple Watch series 5 and this Fitbit versa 2, of course the budget difference was a key decision, I decided to not spend the extra 200 and regret it. Mostly the watch works fine but the tracker and calorie counter is completely wrong, I counted my steps and checked the tracker( took in consideration extra couple steps because the pace when you walk isn’t always the same including arm movement and it was still overcounting way too much) I was at home and barely did 500 the whole day and it said I had over 2000.Overall not worth buying, in addition I also bought one for my dad and he encountered the same problem so it can’t be just my watch that’s defected.Worth the extra 200$ for Apple Watch.You also can’t respond msgs and calls on this watch if you don’t have an Android because Apple doesn’t support third party connection.",2

The last one is the versa 2 and it lasted 8 months and all of a sudden it will no longer hold a charge.

Maybe mine is slowly dying after roughly a year and a half, but just walked around the house wearing it and got no steps out of it. Shook it a bit while held tightly in my grip, and it counted.",3

It allegedly has a one year warranty, but buying through Amazon doesn't seem to activate it (you need the order number to start the return policy).

No matter what the product details, websites, etc. say, this watch will NOT sync with the Pandora app! And does not work well with other apps that I have downloaded; including Fitbit Coach. This is a far cry from a ""SmartWatch"".In other words, this watch and related app leave a lot to be desired. A gave it the benefit of the doubt, thinking that I could get this to work and now it is too late to refund. The watch no appears to be ""degrading"" in the sense that it does not reliability stay connected to my phone and PC.Do yourself a favor and get a Samsung!",1

0,These fitbits come from the group of Versa 2's that are broken. We had to contact the manufacturer and they know about them. The screen won't turn off. The screen won't scroll. The altimeter stopped working too. I would strongly recommend the versa 3 or similar model instead of the flawed 2s.,1

Never, ever buy this. Never buy a Fitbit. This is the second one I've returned.",1
1,"If you have slender wrists, the Versa 2 is TOO big and is always getting in the way. It is impossible to change the bands even if you follow instructions to the letter. The treadmill and distance tracking are always incorrect--I'm basing that on Google's mileage. Sleep tracking is a nice feature. Weather doesn't work and neither do wi-fit settings. I called FITBIT and they said they are ""working on it"". I feel like a chump for having purchased it. Save your money! And now I see that I've missed the return window by a few days. Grrrr!!",3
1,"I had fitbit Charge 3, and it have screen burn in issues. Ultimately I can's use my Fitbit charge 3, as you see nothing out of screen. I opt for Fossil Gen 5 as a replacement and it feel like battery drain every minutes. Although after few days, it works like my phone at about 30% drain for day time light usage. And it's a bit balky, then I choose to get Versa 2. It feels like back to charge 3 with effective 5 days' battery power. But it works like to smarter fitbit Charge 3. I'm happy with it. Depends on how's your expectation, as a fitbit charge 3 user, it works like a smarter Charge 3.",4
1,I bought this to replace my previous versa Fitbit. I absolutely love it for everyday use and workouts. Battery life is also great can go up to 5 days without charging.,5
1,"I love my versa 2 with Alexa. The only thing I don't like is that it picks up my hand motion as steps. I sit at a desk for most of the day and yet it reds a high amount of steps, even if I have it set as dominant or non dominant hand. Wish it had a way of picking up the diffrence but other than that I like it a lot. Wish it had GPS but was aware of this when I bought it. Got it early in the year and still happy. Love that I can change bands.",4
1,"The auto recognize is hit or miss. they've asked me to restart, which i've done multiple times..and then wanted to do an reset! it's was only a week old.. I shouldn't have to start messing around with it. Works fine if i manual start an exercise, but don't count on the auto recognize feature.",3
1,I switched from Apple to Fitbit and never looked back. I didn’t use a lot of the Apple Watch apps. I do have an iPhone. I occasionally would talk to text on the watch. But I wanted for time and exercise tracking. I got my husband the Versa 2 for Christmas. The battery life on the Apple drove me crazy. Without daily charge forget about it. Busy days it barely lasted a day. The Fitbit battery is so much better and has all of the features I used on the Apple Watch. So I switched! The only thing I liked better about Apple was the band. This is a great product for the price.,5
1,"Overall this watch is accurate and a great purchase. My only complaint is the mild irritation the charging ports were leaving on my wrist after wearing it so long. I was wearing it to bed and all day,taking it off for roughly an hour or 2. However, I started putting a small piece of tape to cover them and no longer get the mild rash on my wrist. For people with sensitive skin this is a quick fix.Also,the connection issues can be irritating but not enough to say it wasn't worth the purchase. I'd still recommend it",4
1,"There are NO written instructions on set up and application. I've had mine 5 days and thought I was supposed to be able to answer a call without my phone because it's called a smart watch and still was not getting text messages or notifications. I spent hours online trying to troubleshoot without any help. I finally found a phone number to call and was told my Versa 2 does not take calls, you actually have to use the phone. To me, this is false advertising to call it a smart watch when it does not do what a smart phone does in that sense. It's highly annoying to not have written instructions in the package it comes in and it has been a waste of my time and caused me high frustration.",3
0,"Got this as a gift for my birthday, worked for 2 weeks and then froze up, spent an hour online with fitbit to try to fit it with no luck. Returned to Amazon and requested an exact replacement thinking maybe I just got a bad one. WRONG, the replacement arrived the next day but didn't work either. Spent another 1/2 hr on the phone with fitbit and was told to return it for a replacement. I'm done with the replacements, I will find another product to purchase, so dissappointed. Loved my fitbit alta but this product is a DUD.",1
1,"I was between an Apple Watch or the Fitbit Versa 2 for a while, and I am SO happy I chose to go with the Versa 2! It has almost all of the features an Apple Watch has, but is sold for a much lower price. My favorite feature is the sleep tracker, as it has made me much more aware of the quality of sleep I get, as well as the amount of sleep I get. The only thing is, the watch counts hand motions as steps taken. I try to take the watch off if I know I will be be moving my hands a lot when playing games or cleaning.",5
0,"This watch is pretty much only good for tracking exercise, and even then it doesn't have a GPS function. Using it for texting was very frustrating, it would often miss messages. Or if I had more than one text at a time I was unable to reply to them by watch. My Pandora account didn't work because I'm not a premium member, and it took me over 3 hours to sync when I first received the watch. It ended up being $200 of frustration so I returned the watch after 2 days.",2
0,"I really loved my Fitbit but after less than six months, the screen went haywire, displayed only static, and is now completely useless. For a watch of this cost, it should last longer than six months. Luckily, I've returned the broken watch to Fitbit and we'll see if I actually get a replacement.",2
1,"Battery life not 6 days, more like 3. But that's the only negative.",5
1,"I love the watch but this watch is my second one, I think it is really low of Fitbit to not make chargers that fit more than one watch. I had just bought a charger for my previous watch and it was just a hair difference in chargers so I could not use the 2 previous chargers.",5
1,"Really have nothing to complain about, the build quality is good and it has all the features one could ask for. I often get more than 5 days out of it. I have had it for 1 year with no issues and use it when swimming, walking, playing, shoveling, snow blowing.",5
1,"husband bought this for me in January for my birthday. worked great until about 2 months ago. the automatic motion to see the clock isn't always working, have to touch the side to turn it on and the button doesn't always work. It will not hold a charge longer than 3 to 4 days. notifications do not come up on phone anymore",3
1,"I am very pleased with my Versa 2. It acutely tracks steps, heart rate, and numerous other activities. The many apps that can be added are numerous. I use the alarms and timer very regularly. I also use Amazon Alexia on a daily bases. My only complaint is the sleep tracker is of no use.",5
1,"I love this watch. The battery lasts a long time, it tracks my sleep and exercise and I love that I can text on it. I will definitely be upgrading to Versa 3 soon!",5
1,"Really solid device. Battery life isn't good as advertised, although that may be due to the type of watch face I am currently utilizing. The Bluetooth and sync can be spotty at times, but that maybe more due to the phone (Samsung s9+) than the fitbit. The mobile app is good but not great. Great at tracking activity and sleep. Would recommend.",4
1,This fitbit has now become a family favorite! Now five of us are wearing them! They track your steps and your sleep patterns awesomely! Great to glance at your heart rate also!,5
1,I love my new watch so much! I had a charge 2 which I also loved but this one is so much better. I love the pink straps and the big face. It’s so stylish! It seems the sleep function works better on this model. I like the option to see or not see all my readings. There are just a lot more options available with this model.,5
0,"I have had several of the original fit bits and wore all of the out. For the price I was completely satisfied replacing them. Finally decided to upgrade and what a nightmare. It tracked sleep for three nights and quit. I had re-started and reset the fit bit so many times I can do it by memory. Used the exercise tracker several times and it works % of the time. Went on an hour long bike ride this morning and traveled 0 miles. I will never buy another Fitbit product as long as I am alive. Really the leave this kind of review and it my 1st one, but I would feel remiss if I didn't warn others.",1
0,I had this only 2 weeks before it stopped working.I’ve should’ve returned it but I waited and return window is closed.Second Fitbit I purchased from Amazon that was crap.I’m starting to think they’re refurbished and not BN.Will not buy anything type of item like this from Amazon again.,1
1,"Bought this as a replacement for my old Blaze (which I loved). It's sleeker than the Blaze and has more features. It appears to be better at sleep tracking which I like. Ever since I got my first Fitbit, my sleep time and quality has gotten better. Yay!",5
1,Hubby loves his Christmas gift!,5
1,"Best tracker watch I have ever owned. BPM is almost as accurate as my blood pressure monitor. I was working out downstairs and knew as soon as I went into AFIB, double checked with my monitor and the pulse and bpm matched. All other functions of the tracker works great! Love Alexa on the watch, great touch!",5
1,"I bought this for my wife for Christmas and she loves it. It fits great, keeps track of steps, sleep, and heart rat along with other things. My wife did wish it had more apps and has not used it to listen to music on but hopes that works well. I definitely would recommend this to anyone looking for a fitbit and as a bonus this watch works with Alexa.",5
0,"Heart rate monitor accuracy leaves a lot to be desired. Have used Fitbit devices for several years now, but this one is disappointing. My original Versa was much more accurate. I thought maybe I received a bad device, but there are many reviews with similar complaints.",2
1,having trouble with battery life,4
1,"Got this because I liked the features and didn't want to spring for the apple watch. My friend recommended the Versa 2 and I'm so happy I went with this watch. The initial link to the app was not all that smooth which is why i gave it a 4 and not 5 start rating, but once I got it linked it was all I needed and more. I highly recommend the Versa 2, well worth the money",5
0,"Every single day, I go to sync watch to my phone and get device not found. I uninstall the app which takes forever and works for a short time. Then device not found. Very frustrating.",1
1,I went from the Charge HR to the versa and I love this one so much more. The only thing I would say I dislike about the watch is I wanted to use it for running to track my progress but the only way to do that is to bring your phone with you during your run unless I’m doing something wrong. Besides that all of the features are great.,4
0,I am disappointed in this product. A year after use and the darn thing has literally fallen apart. The band has torn in the main hole that I use. Then today the screen popped out. I guess the adhesive failed.,1
1,"Great accountability device. This keeps me aware of my activity, and I compete for better numbers. I’ve lost 9 pounds since I bought in Jan 2020. Some difficulty in gathering all activity. Sleep tracking gives me good general info but it’s not real accurate. I am very happy with my Versa all things considered.",4
1,"The media could not be loaded.
 As much as I love this watch. I hate it. This is my second return to fitbit for a new issue. I love my warranty too it just take too long for the repair and return. This screen issue I'm having really sucks 😕",5
1,"I bought this for my mom and it has been great for her. She charged it last week and it's at 35% still, so good battery life. The app walks you through everything to set it up, very simple and no problems. It's very durable, we also bought a screen protector for it. Tracks sleep and all your activities and works great. Great buy, reccomend this watch!",5
1,This was purchased as a gift item for somebody trying to get back into a regular exercise routine. She likes the device and find it very useful. It apparently has helped her stay with the program and get herself back in shape!,5
1,"Love this. Would like it to track sleep for shorter periods of time like when you take a nap. Great for fitness. Use it to hot yoga class and I burned 222 calories. Good HR monitoring, activity tracking. I don't keep it connected to my phone since having messages and calls in my watch is not what I want and the battery can last up to 8 days, with a12 % of daily decrease.",5
0,"Purchased at the end of February and given as a gift on March 2, 2021. Already quit working and totally dead. Literally got 3 months of wear before it died! Going to try to see if factory warranty will honor it. Not a good track record!",2
0,Quit working after 3 months! The left button stopped working and the screen is frozen to set up wallet. Fitbit is sending a replacement but I am a little concerned the same thing will happen again in 3 months. I had my last Fitbit for 3.5 years and never had any problems with it.,1
0,"I loved my original Versa so when I cracked the face, I was stoked to get the newest version. Works great... for about two weeks. Its now been 3 months (purchase date 10/26/19) and the face lights up once and then I have to sync it to make it light up again. And forget about using any of the features since it doesn't swipe. Battery life is super awesome. Too bad the my watch isn't. I hope it's just dumb luck that I got such a frustrating piece of sh*t, but it really blows!Update 5/26/2020Battery lasts about 48 hrs or less. So dissapointed this review hasn't gotten a response from Fitbit or Amazon",1

1,"This watch is very useful! My favorite part is that it has Alexa! And I keep track of everything I have to do throughout the day! Appointments, to do lists, shopping lists, alarm, etc. It feels comfortable and I like the screen, it looks sleek! You can have games, music, apps.. and best of all!!! Waterprooof!!!!🙌 the only thing its missing it's being able to receive messages.. it does let you know about missing calls.",4
0,"I purchased my Fitbit Versa 2 from Amazon in mid April. It functions as advertised but it causes pain in my wrist hand and arm. I have tried to loosen it and even move it further up my wrist but the pain persists. If I stop wearing the Fitbit, the pain disappears within a day or two. Going back to wearing the Fitbit, the pain comes back. This is an aching discomfort that is in the wrist, back of my hand and up to my bicep. I can no longer use this product.",1
1,"Everything about this watch is outstanding and was so happy to have finally received it, now the disappointing factor is the fact that you can’t respond to messages unless you have an android even though it syncs to both phones yet with iPhones you can’t respond to messages and if I had known that after watching all the videos this wouldn’t of been an option for me, as well as the gps tracking is only available through your phone so when wanting to do anything or go on run you have to take your phone in order for it to work. Everything else on the watch is perfect and really love it but so extremely disappointed in the fact that I can’t even respond to a simple text messages cause I have an iPhone even though this is a “smart watch”.",3
0,Screen came off a 2months after warranty expired (i.e. lasts for a year and 2 months) Not worth the price... When contacted they said they cant do anything and then sent me a 35% off discount code which when used would be the same price I bought it for during Prime. Will look into alternative sturdier watches.Watch worked great until customer support decided to flip me off.,1
1,"I just bought this watch and so far I like it. I haven't figured out how to get my text messages on it yet. The time display is easy to read. I like the fact that it reminds me every hour during the day that I need to get steps in. There is an expanded pack of features that you can purchase, but right now I'm just getting used to the basics.",4
1,"It was easy to set up and I like keeping track of my steps. My granddaughter has one, so she added different features that are offered. I can actually see the time much better than my smaller Fitbit!",5
1,"Been using everyday and sleep. Suddenly stop working when 4 moths old. Screen not responding and constantly froze up. Very frustrated , contact fitbit, keep asking to update FW and reboot watch. still same problem for another month. Contact Fitbit again and ask for warranty but ask to upgrade FW again. This time seems works, Watch been working so far no issue. Touch screen working for now. 4 more month before 1 year warranty expire.",3
0,"This was my 4th FitBit watch and each one broke or malfunctioned either right away or a few months later. My last watch of which I cannot now return as the window frame to return was only a month, went black several months ago. It didn’t need charging, it was not in water, it just went dead black. I’ll never buy Fitbit again until the quality improves. I love the Fit Bit, bit all I’ve had were lemons. The charger of this last watch was even made too small to fit the watch properly inside to charge. Awful product for quality, though the idea of it is great.",1
0,I had looked forward to trying the versa and having an affordable smart watch. However I was sitting at my desk and it told me my heart rate was 140 bpm which is impossible because I take medication that keeps my HR down around 60. It could have been a glitch and I tried multiple resets and when I contacted customer service I was told they had never heard of anything like this before. No product is perfect I was surprised that nobody else had ever had false readings. I am very leery of purchasing another one.,1
1,"Excited to get a watch that had capabilities to download apps. This is a great smartwatch capable of connecting to wireless earbuds and it has capacity for music. I wanted to use Pandora with my Versa2, but found out after purchase that I needed to subscribe to a Premium Pandora account. Spotify was the same way, had to subscribe to an account. Great fitness tracker, automatically prompts you if you started running and forgot to have the watch record the exercise. Also, there is a pause feature if you take a break in the middle of the run. Love the watch, it is very easy to use and has a lot of capabilities.",5
0,Waited months for this watch to arrive and was very excited to give it to my wife. When it finally arrived we found it was just a glorified Fitbit. It doesn't stay synced unless it is right next to your phone so all you get is an unnecessary extra ringer for your phone. On top of it all it just wants you to pay extra for apps. Imo a very poor excuse for a smart watch!,1
0,"I got this to replace my Ionic, which I had for a couple of years and was great, but was starting to fail. The feature in the Versa 2 where it pairs with your phone to track GPS probably saves on battery life, but the accuracy was terrible. I did a half marathon along the Mississippi Gulf Coast in December and the GPS recorder it as 8.4 miles. I like to track splits on races like that, so I'm going to try a Garmin next.This thing did pretty good in counting steps and even elevation, but the horrible GPS inaccuracy is a deal killer for me.",2
0,"Didn't work and after 3 calls to customer service they claimed it was a ""known bug"" and there was no fix. Was not offered a replacement or money back even though it didn't work. Luckily I purchased through Amazon so it was easy to return.",1

Just saying you need to pay for the app to get the other things...",1
0,"It worked for 5 months, from what I am finding, this is a problem that is happening to many people. Bluetooth will not pair to laptop or android.

Wish I researched this better.",1
0,"Why can't manufacturers build products that work the way they are supposed to right out of the box anymore? I left the Versa 2 connected overnight to charge the battery and do a ""20 minute"" update and it did NOTHING except tell me no update because it can't find either wireless or bluetooth. REALLY? I paid good money for junk. Sending back ASAP!!!",1
1,"This watch is great, however, the Fitbit app keeps crashing! I've only had this watch 2 weeks and I've had to uninstall and reinstall the app at least 3 times to get the app to find my watch. That is the only solution for this issue according to the app in the Play store. Too bad Fitbit can't invest in the app as much as they have their trackers.",5
0,"First off, you should know that if you have an older smartphone this won't work with it. You need to have a newer (Android) operating system. Otherwise, you're just stuck using the app on your PC to sync your data, etc.Second, and worse, is that the Fitbit died when I was trying to set it up for the first time. It had a charge of 68%. It seemed to get about halfway synced with my PC, and then the screen went black, and it became completely unresponsive. I'm sending it back for a replacement. We'll see how that goes. Maybe I'll update this if it works out.Pretty annoying, I have to say. The product is nice to look at. That's the only good thing I can say right now.",1
1,Somewhat disappointed- tho mainly with the sleep tracking and the app. The sleep tracker keeps getting my bedtime wrong.Maybe it works better with an android phone? I think I might swap out for an Apple Watch. Otherwise it seems like a good product. And the seller is fine.,3
1,I bought this watch for my moms birthday . She already had a versa watch that she loved very much but it end up getting broken from her hiking and hitting it on a rock so I bought her the newer version and she absolutely loves it we just ended up getting her a cover face for the wash so it doesn’t get broken again .,5
1,"I was looking mostly for step tracking and heart rate monitoring. I was also looking for a smart watch that would be able to sync with my Continuous Glucose Monitor.Battery lasts a little longer than expected (I’m sure it would be less if I had more notifications set up).Overall, it’s a great fitness tracker with just enough smart watch features without breaking the bank.",5
1,"I just got it, set it up and done 2 exersizes. I can't say I love it, but its great so far. The 1 con is that when i shake my wrist, it sometimes calculates as steps. this is the only con, and a major one for me. My mail box is around a 1/2 mile away. I also rode to the mailbox and back, putting the bicycle exersize out and nothing calculated. I'll update when i can get evreything else.",4
1,"I received a little less than a week ago. I was very excited to see my sleep score and analyze it after the first night, unfortunately it hasn’t provided me with a sleep score since then. Quite disappointing since that’s the whole reason I bought it. I’ll also wake up with over 100 steps already logged from laying in bed. I’ll have to look into returning and buying one that actually does what it said it does. Quite frustrating!",3
1,"I like the Versa 2 but the accuracy is questionable. I log steps and burn calories when im sitting and even sleeping. This is very disappointing. People buy these exercise trackers expecting accuracy. Not confident that this version of Fitbit is doing that. This is my first tracker purchased. If I had all the info before purchasing, I probably would've gone another way. It's also difficult to reset it.",4
0,"I have had my Versa two for just over a month. Nearly three weeks ago, I noticed some issues with the touch screen not responding when I tried to swipe or select apps. It got worse, as it then wouldn’t respond even when I tried to use the side button and now intermittently (more often than not) will not respond without excessive efforts, restarting, resetting, and even restoring to factory settings. Each time I do this, it’s back to doing the same thing within an hour. I’ve reported to tech support, tried the chat feature, and they are telling me to do all of the same things I’ve already tried many times. It’s just past my return window now, but I would really appreciate a chance to return my device. I love the fit and look of it, but it just doesn’t work and has caused my frustration than convenience.",1
1,"I’ve had a Fitbit Versa 2 for a few months now and I love it. It tracks my sleep very accurately and the mobile app is very detailed. Battery life has been a pleasant surprise- over a week without having to recharge it and you can fill it up from empty in about an hour. It has really helped me understand the amount of exercise that I do everyday and it encourages you to step up those days that you are not meeting your goals, which is the important thing to me to stay active. The only downside is sometimes it doesn’t not track well the stairs you climb. Overall I really recommend it to anyone who wants to have a fitness device.",5
1,"It’s amazingly comfortable. The sleep app is giving me wonderful insight and it’s helping me make better choices.It seems to be pretty darn accurate and syncs with the app very well.Batter life might not be 6 days if you are very active and set up reminders and such, but it gets better charge than my iPhone.",5

1,Battery life is around 4-5 days normal use. Maybe shorter if you sleep with it. I prefer not to wear it at night. I've not used Alexa option but seems like it could be useful in some cases. I had tried to get an i-watch but it was never delivered so just requested a refund and got this instead for a fraction of the price. No regrets yet.,5

This ""upgrade"" of the original Versa is an extreme disappointment.",1
1,Very impressed with the features and comfort of this device. Tracks exercise and sleep automatically. App stores all info and has easy to add food calorie counts. Cute watch faces available for cheap purchase prices. The band is very comfortable and I hardly know I’m wearing it. Good battery life. Syncs well with my iPhone and displays calls and messages. Would buy again.,5
0,Versa 2 was providing a heart rate when not even wearing it. All the heart rates were high. Heart rate when wearing was not even close. I returned after 3 days. This was a cheaply made product.,1
1,"I was using the fitbit blaze before upgrading to this model. Everything works as it should but I needed some time to get used to the new OS, menu and layout. Had some trouble setting up the fitbit wallet but eventually was resolved. The Alexa also works fine but do note that the fitbit app must be running in the background of your phone for it to work. Battery life seems OK but not great, had to disable the always-on display to conserve battery life.",5
0,"I purchased my Fitbit in December of 2019. I had it for about 4 months and without any trauma to the watch, the face popped off. Lucky I had the insurance and sent it to them to fix. Got it back and a few months later the same thing happened while I was sitting at my desk at work. I waited a while but 2 weeks ago I finally sent it back to get fixed and here we are again. As you can see in the picture the face popped off again and this time it looks like it was just glued down. I wish I would have spent and extra $100 and got a real smartwatch.",1
0,Very unstable product and helpless Amazon support. Wasted 2 hours of my time with them to end up with fitbit support. Just to return to damn Amazon support.,1
1,I am so happy I bought this watch! I use it along with the Lose It app to log my food and exercise. The combo has been so helpful in keeping me motivated and aware of how much I'm actually moving and eating. I would recommend this to anyone wanting to get in better shape or lose weight.,5
1,"Product is one od the best ""smart watches"" I've ever owned. I'm a long time Pebble user and I have tried many, many others. In my experience, if you loved your Pebble and want many more features mixed with better battery life and voice reply (awesome) then this is the nest FitBit yet!",4
1,It’s pretty sleek. Sleep tracking doesn’t always track sleep though. I. Price the Fitbit charge 3 tracked sleep better. Battery life is about 2ish days with clock display always on. The features to use Spotify and what not is nice. It’s a shame Apple prevents the quick replies because I hated Apple Watch. This tracker is a nice simple but cool tool,5
1,"I love mine very much. It helps me be more active. And I need that lol, it can get annoying at times when I need to get more steps in and it tells me with ten minutes left in that hour. But over all a great product. I love that I'm able to change clock faces using the app so it's not the same one all the time. It does amazing with tracking my sleep, as someone who wakes up quite a bit during the night it's nice to see when it happens and how long I was awake for during those times, it also tells me how my sleep was how long I was in a deep sleep for and how long i was in a light sleep. It's truly amazing.",5
1,"I have had the watch for about a week and I am really enjoying it. I have an android phone so I am able to respond to texts and I like that. I am getting all my notifications (email, snapchat etc) on the phone which is nice. I really like the sleep tracking too. Being able to see my steps is nice and makes me more aware to move more. I have had a slight reaction to the band after wearing it 24hours a day, but nothing horrible. All in all, for the price ($129) I am really happy I got this watch!",5
1,"I did really like it, but the battery will no longer last more than 12 hours on a full charge. This is after daily wear for only 15 months. For this price it should last much longer.",3
0,Replaced a versa with the newer Versa 2 thinking it would be an improvement. WRONG! Doesn't perform nearly as well. Says I wake up around 3:30 everyday night and don't get back to sleep. Can't find an alarm to set on it. May return it.,2
0,"Who cares about alexa! Just show me my steps and dont make me search for the sync button. Why does this watch suffer so much to sync. HELP HELP HELP! sleep tracker is great, wish i knew what it meant - but who cares without the steps!",1
0,So I bout this at the end of May four months later amd it's dead. It started glitches and then just died. Don't recommend buy this fitbit. Has had issues with it not working right from week 1. Should have returned it then. I guess I'm just out $300 will be buying a different brand of smart watch as this seems to be a problem for them that they know about and refuse to fix.,1
1,"The pedometer could be better. Sometimes I'll just be sitting at my desk not even moving and I'll suddenly get a notification from my watch that I've hit my step goal. Otherwise, it's amazing. Comfortable, great battery, awesome clock face options, etc. I've had it +5 months now and I don't think I'll ever go without one again.",5
0,"If you look ”Versa 2” for simple tasks and you are not interested in real stats, this is the perfect watch.Verse 2 watch is terrible tracking ”pace” of your running. To track sleeping mode and horrible on the heart rate final numbers.Please, buy Garmin or apple watch instead. It would be more valuable for you.Plus doesn't help that if you are buying from Amazon is a defected watch.",2
1,"It's amazing! Battery lasts about 4-5 days and it charges so quick. Also, you can personalize it through the app on your phone: add simple games to the watch, you can pay through it, you can customize the screen, etc. It's a great way to stay active cause you can try to reach your goal easier this way :)",5
1,"I had the fitbit charge 3 for a year and decided to upgrade to the vesa 2, I love the bigger screen size, but its pretty much the same features as my previous charge 3. Only downside for me was how hard it was to swap out the bands, broke both my thumb nails trying to put the new bands in, and it was the genuine replacement that came with it.",5
1,Like all fitbits it tracks my hand more then my steps. I notice it most when bagging items or petting my cats lmao I'd hoped that this would have been fixed since the last model I had. I'd recommend samsung fit it also comes with a S.O.S setting all watches should have.,3
1,For the price and what you get is good 👍If you need a full boat get the Fit Bit Sense and the program that is available that completes the package. Then you need a week to establish a base line. To start with. I'm still learning.,5
1,I loved this watch when I first got it as worked great with my Samsung Galaxy 8+. I just got anew phone - Samsung Galaxy S20+. It will do fitness tracking but just discovered this phone is not compatible with Fitbit to receive phone notifications. Very disappointing.,3
1,"I love this watch and the fact that it talks to the app on my phone and account on the website. I like the fact that I can easily change the way it works or display the time. I no longer pay attention to how many steps I make in a day, but it's still good to know that it is there. Over all it's better then the previous version.",5
0,Most frustrating experience with a device in a while. Simply will not pair with a phone that is clearly on the manufacturers compatible list. Pairs then drops Bluetooth and then you literally have to uninstall and reboot phone and the watch and start all over. Do not purchase if you have an Android phone you will be disappointed. Horrible software.,1
1,"This device does everything well! Lots of apps, too! You can download music to it if you have the right kind of account - I do wish it had an Amazon Music app and an Amazon Audible app. Wish I could respond to texts from it, too. That doesn’t work with iPhone unfortunately.",5
0,The heart rate monitor failed with 6 months and Fitbit replaced it for free but then the second one failed in just over 6 months and it is now out of warranty. Sleep tracking is one of the main features I care about. Switching to Apple to see if it lasts longer,1
1,"I love the phone finder feature. I know when I get a call, email or text. And, when I misplace my phone, I can easily find it...even when my phone is on silent.",4
0,"Terrible product! I have had 2 replacement because the others stopped working. Now my third watch stopped working completely. At first it was just my notifications that stopped, but now the whole watch quit. Customer service does nothing to help! Would not recommend.",1
1,"This watch is very nice, but it has low battery life. I am constantly charging it.I paid $178 for this watch and expected the battery charge would last at leastfour days, not two.",4
1,Always a fan of Fitbit. This does not disappoint. Very happy with it. Works great. Notifications have worked great. Sleep tracking works. Syncs up fine with my iPhone.,5
0,Only works for about a year than will crap out on you. Every fitbit watch does this that I've tried.,2
1,"Worked great for 4 months, then the motion sensor quit working. I've tried all the hacks to fix but nothing works. So basically it's just an expensive watch that tells me my heartbeat per minute. Cant tell me distance I've walked on treadmill or how many steps I've taken. Very disappointed.",3
1,"Compared to numerous Fitbit trackers my family has owned, the design for the band replacement on the Versa 2 is awful. I've watched YouTube videos of people with much younger hands and eyes than ours struggle with this task. Please Fitbit, if you can't do something about this design on the Versa 2, at least improve on it for future editions...",4
1,Upgraded from a charge 2 to the versa 2 and I couldn’t be happier. I was contemplating an Apple Watch but the charge daily issue turned me away. My versa 2 lasts about 5 days on a charge and doesn’t take long to charge up either.Responds quickly.Love the workout tracking! And love that you can change the clock face. Best upgrade and decision I could have made!,5
0,I received this watch yesterday and do far I absolutely hate Fitbir app. I'm going to give it couple of more days but I think I'll return it and no more Fitbit for me.,1
1,Very confusing to set up for a senior. Had to call for help. Screen size is good. Haven't figured it all out yet but seems to be an upgrade from the older one.,3
0,"Hi there,I dropped my FitBit, and the screen on it broke. I've checked out some community pages to see what I can do and couldn't find an answer, and the support on my FitBit ended in April. This was an expensive purchase for me, and I'm stressed to think I might need to buy a whole new watch because of poor quality. Can someone contact me to talk about my options?",1
1,I got this for Christmas from my boyfriend. I think it's even better than what I read up on! I have sleep issues. So the sleeping chart shows my sleep pretty accurately. I have heart issues also. It keeps track of heart rate through out the day and night. I also didn't know you could receive texts messages through the watch. I have an S21+ cell phone. I know ot says water proof but from reading the reviews I choose to take the watch off when I shower swim or do dishes. All and all I would recommend the versa 2. It was a pretty cool gift.,5
1,I would be happier if the app linked with Apple Health. The watch advertised blood Oxygen but you can’t normally see it. The sleep function does seem to track O2. I don’t like scrolling through all the workout options. You would think it could customize it.,4
0,"After numerous attempts to get the Versa 2 to sync to the Fitbit app and following all the troubleshooting recommendations, I contacted customer support. I found that there is a known issue with iOS/OS 13, and no timeframe for a resolution. It did work at times, which is surprising since there is an issue, and it worked good then. If it worked as it should and synced, I think I would give it 5 stars.",2
0,This was my second Fitbit Versa. I had the original Fitbit Versa and loved it. This one barely kept a charge. I had to return it. I appreciated how easy the return was.,1
0,The on/off button must be pushed hard to turn on. Things like adding water aren't accurate unless keyed in through the app. Alexa doesn't understand what you say & not easy to use. Tracks 2 different amounts of steps each day & still haven't figured out why bc they are not even close to being the same. Need instruction booklet to get the benefits of what it can do.,1
0,"Purchased this model to help track my quality of sleep and it worked well for the 1st month but after the window closed to return it, it stopped giving me a sleep score, stopped tracking my sleep so I had to pull logs manually and my app went from giving me the new graph of showing sleep cycles to the old graphs that are useless for interpreting data.My gf has the same model and it works well. I may have gotten a lemon for a model.",2
0,"I recently purchased this fitness watch solely to use while at the gym or running so I could listen to music. Spotify only works if you play it thru your phone making this feature absolutely pointless. Deezer and Pandora don't work. The software can't seem to upload any of the music. If you look up issues on FitBits own user forum, you will find several people having the same issues and the best answer out there is ""I reset to factory settings"" and now it's working"". If you want a fitness smart watch, get something cheaper. If you want a fitness watch that plays music, this one doesn't actually do it.",1
1,The wrist band was not durable and broke where it was supposed to lock into the fitbit device. Had to buy another wristband because the original one that it came with was defective.,3
1,Watch does most things very well. But it fails at getting the distant right on my hikes. I've done several things suggested by support. I have learned to live with it as so many others have noted.,3
1,My father is over 70 years old and was worried about staying active. I bought this for him and he is more active than every before. He likes to track things so this was a perfect gift and idea.,5
1,"I love many aspects of this product. It wasn’t expensive, it gives me my pulse rate and steps and it is easy to read. One reason I purchased this was to get text messages and alerts to phone calls. This works sporadically at best, haven’t figured out why yet. It is very frustrating.",3
1,I ruined my first Versa 2 by swimming in a pool with it on. I looked at several other models and chose to go with the Versa 2 again.,5
1,The detailed sleep graph worked for two days then began to record only sleep patterns. I went to the fitbit community to look for help and a lot of people had the same problem. There were no answers from customer service. Only unhelpful automatic responses. I bought the watch for sleep tracking. I will update my rating if I can resolve the issue.,3
1,"This item is absolutely sensational. Pairing it was a breeze, and now it works without problems. The Alexa feature is amazing, and there are so many accessory apps that you can get for free. Unfortunately, you need a Spotify Premium membership to control it, which I am thinking of getting. But other than that, it is amazing! Highly recommend!",5
1,"i love the accuracy and the hourly reminders to move. The challenges are fun and keep me motivated. The sleep tracker works well also. I dont use Alexa or Fitbit pay or Pandora, so those are extras I don't need. I really like being able to easily, change clockfaces to match my clothes or mood or an occasion, like a holiday. Fun!",5
0,"I’ve had this about 6 months and it’s just not functioning correctly. The time is incorrect, won’t sync, and is pretty much useless.I have researched all the issues but nothing gets it working as it should",2
1,"It is very accurate, I love the adventure options and it can set minimum requirements for yourself throughout the day. Working at a desk can keep me sedentary but the fitbit Versa 2 reminds me to get my minimum steps each hour. My coworkers are getting used to seeing me randomly lapping the clinic lol. I only have to charge it once a week or so. I did buy an aftermarket band for it though.",5
0,Love fitbit app and this is my third fitbit. But this died as soon as I went swimming... Very disappointing. Had to return and am on the hunt for a tracker that does what it does.,2
1,Love this watch! Easy to set up. Accuracy seems to be great...has helped me lose 20lbs!! Looks good on the wrist. I took away1 star due to the difficulty in changing the wrist band...,4
0,"Garbage. 2nd fitbit, 1st stopped working after about 1 year (convenient). Thought i was upgrading by getting the versa 2. Here i am less just over 6 months out and the sensor gave up. Save money and time, dont buy fitbit.",1
1,I got this for my best friend for her birthday and she absolutely loves it. It encourages her to get more active and track her sleep. She said it is one of the best gifts she has received. I highly suggest it. I already have FitBit as well and I love it!,5
0,"I've just got this for my daughter and it's impossible to set up. It does not connect to any Apple devices we have, it cannot be discovered by Bluetooth and the App to set up on the MAC does not even list this model (Versa 2). I have never had such a difficult to set up device. I'm ready to return it. Technical support is useless.",1
0,"I have already had to charge it from 1 battery twice. My husband has the exact same one, we started using them on the same days, and he has yet to drop below 45%, and he has the different clock faces on his, which I would think would drain the battery more...and the wifi is constantly dropping connection so I have to go on my phone to the app and re-find my network and everything. It just seems like a unequal product.....",2
1,"I’m pretty bummed that the heart rate option stopped working only one year after purchase. I tried all the reset options mentioned online, but I had no success. Without that feature my sleep isn’t tracked either.",3
0,"PROs: Looks sleek, has a pretty good heart monitor, has exceptional battery life. Useful for basic functions like clock, timer, etc.CONs: Does not work with iOS 13. Fitbit has been ""working on it"" since September 2019, with no resolution. You won't get text notifications. Also, mine will not stay connected to WiFi.OVERALL: It's buggy and not worth the price. If the features actually worked as advertised, I would rate at 4 or 5 stars.",2
1,"I am a computer literate person but had difficulty getting my fit bit Versa to work.Just a suggestion - step by step written directions included in the box would have been great!!Thanks to my wonderful daughter in law, the fit bit Versa works fine and is awesome!",5
0,"I had high hopes as I wanted primarily a fitness tracker to avoid lugging my phone along for my runs and biking. The accuracy is very low, for example, the watch told me I burned 600 calories within 30 minutes while I was sitting stationary. The heart monitoring also seemed inaccurate. I will be looking for other options.",2
0,"This item is my 3rd one at this point since October and I went directly to fitbit twice after purchasing on amazon. This watch is not at all accurate with miles run or walked. It does not track your swim either. I would not recommend this watch. I had a polar watch for 6 years and used it all the time for all sport including biking, swimming, running and walking and it was the best watch but the battery could not be replaced. I am going back to Polar hands down. Do not buy this watch if you are an active person and like accuracy.",1
0,"The Versa 2 quit working right after the 3rd month of use.Kept good care of it, regularly charged it, and was not tough on it at all. Unable toI would recommend a different brand.Tried to find their return policy on their website, kind of gave me the run around and I am completely unsure if my watch is returnable under their ""1 year"" warranty.",1
0,"Worst purchase ever. While I loved my previous FitBit charge, this one is pure junk. It loses sync with my phone almost daily and only re-syncs after an hour or so of turning things on and of. Eventually, every 2-3 weeks I need to do a full factory reset to get it to start syncing again. I highly regret my purchase.",1
1,I have to say all in all this is a good product. HOWEVER there is a very major issue with it constantly disconnecting from the Bluetooth and WI-FI.,4
0,"This product doesn’t work 100 percent with their app Customer service won’t do anything about it because the watch functions. Last Fitbit I will own Terrible customer service, chat and on phone. They don’t care they have your money. Highly recommend chat over phone very hard to understand the people on other end of phone",1
1,"I bought this watch to aid in my training for a marathon, and had no idea how much I would love it for all of the other things that it does! I love that it has all of the functions of a smart watch while still being able to give me a good breakdown of my workouts. I also have it linked to my diet tracking app so I can easily track how many calories I've had, the breakdown of my macros and how it correlates with the calories I've burned. This is such a great multi-function watch and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for something that does it all!",5
1,I take the exact same walk everyday and the watch can range from 2.17 miles to 3.2 miles for the same walk. It is closer to three. But it’s frustrating that it’s so inaccurate and only sometimes connects to the GPS in my phone for the accurate counting.,3
0,I have had a fitbit for 5 yrs and decided to upgrade to this watch version. The battery has to be charged every 3 days!!! It's horrible.,2
0,This product work for two days only fresh out of the package. Would not charge up or retain a charge. Super disappointing. Had to send back Customer/product support could not fix a bad item. Maybe too many bells and whistles to get it right.,1
0,This is the second one I’ve had of this type and the second one to now stop working just after the one year manufacturer warranty runs out. I’m sick of buying a new one every year and spending $100+ on it!,1
1,"I wanted something EZ to use and this is it! I love the large, square face. Set up was easy. Battery life is good and quick to recharge. Highly recommend!",5
0,"Warning: only 7 days to reject and returnRequires proprietary charger. Not legal in Europe and annoying everywhere.Requires account with seller who harvests personal information.Has ""Alexa"" stalking software, THAT YOU CAN'T SHUT OFFDisplay makes poor use of tiny screen.",1
1,"So far so good. The face is a little large, but it has a great set of monitoring capabilities. Makes you very aware of your life activities. The subscription is a little pricey and if you don’t get it, the versatility of the watch decreases greatly.",4
0,"I've owned a few Fitbits, but i bought this to replace my bulky Garmin. I ordered this on May 18, 2020 and it just stopped powering on a couple days ago. I don't shower with it on or anything. I would give it a full charge, and it would be dead in four hours. Maybe i got a dud? Sucks to spend so much and have it barely last a year and I can't return it.",2
1,This is a great piece of equipment that if you’re trying to manage your daily calorie intake heartbeat and have a smart device that will link to your phone this is it and it’s about $200 cheaper than an Apple Watch. Through the Apple Watch has more bells and whistle‘s but it’s a lot of data that I’m not sure I would ever use.,5
1,"I upgraded to the versa 2 after having the charge2 for years. 4!years in and still Love my fitbit and feel I would be lost without having it being a good reminder for me to keep moving, get the steps, drunk my water and track my sleep. Love the app and being able to look back and see where I’ve come, or sometimes if I’ve slacked, to see how much I’ve slacked and get myself going again",5
1,I love this. I was looking for a smart watch//workout tracker that I could see calories per workout while also seeing steps/calories per day. I can track my water and the sleep feature is extremely accurate for me. I would buy another if I needed one. I truly love it and I've moved so much more since I got it.,5
0,"This watch is awesome. Does everything you would want for a smart tracker with smart watch looks. EXCEPT text notifications. For some reason they cant seem how to get notifications to work on new android and/or iPhone. Myself and my fiancé have hit or miss hits on these. I have received 1 in the month ive had it. Ive done everything they have said to do as far as resets ect… I was told its a glitch and it is being worked on......For over a month. Come on guys, get it fixed so I can drop a 5 star rating.",2
0,"I Received my Fitbit on February 4, it is now March 14. This Fitbit keeps turning off randomly and you have to restart it. It seems it keeps happening to a lot of people. For the month that it worked I liked it. I would definitely not recommend this product to anyone, I should’ve just spent money on an Apple Watch. This Fitbit is total garbage. It’s a waste of money do not buy",1
0,"Love the concept of this watch when I purchased it! However, this is only week five and the heart rate monitor has been sporadic thus week. Until today when I've had no pulse since I woke up. Also, during yesterday's morning workout, it started subtracting calories burned. Which continued all day yesterday and today. Receiving emails and text messages on my watch is great but why have a sports component if it doesn't function?",1
0,"It's a great and pretty watch and all, but idk if just user error or what but my watch has trouble staying connected to my phone.. & It says you can read your text messages on it. but since I bought it I haven't been able to receive any of my texts on it.. Not to mention I wish it came with more of a manual because once It disconnects I always struggle to figure out how to reconnect it.. Just my two sense...

 I bought my Versa 2 at the end of January for a gift to my husband for Retiring. I thought it would help him to see how little he was moving after he stopped working! The Versa 2 stopped working on June 10!!! For what l paid for it l thought it would have lasted longer than 5 months!!! Now, it only works while on the charger. Nothing works once it comes off! I have no idea what the problem is. I just know it’s definitely not what l paid for!!!",1
1,The tracker is awesome but after few weeks started to get a rash from the band. Going to try a different band. Other than that this tracker is quite nice.,4
1,I am struggling with the lack of connectivity. Repeatedly tells me to reconnect. Also does not show clock face when raised to viewing height. Having always on display doesnt seem to make any difference. Alexa doesn't stay connected. Not as impressed as I hoped I would have been given the brand and the cost.,3
1,"If you are looking for a smart watch with fitness tracking, look no further then the Fitbit Versa 2. With room for over 300 song storage, and all the fitness tracking options available this watch is fantastic. While you can not answer your cell phone, you can see calls come in and get notifications regarding your emails. I have to say with a four day battery life the Fitbit Versa 2 is everything I could have wanted.",5
0,"I bought this in November and loved it. It is March and, by accident, I let the battery run all the way down and out. It will not recharge. It was a 5 star until this happened. Customer Service was excellent and gets a 5 star also.It is now June and the watch that I received in March stopped working.",1
0,"I wanted to like this watch because of the Alexa app. It would not stay synced. Now it will not sync at all. I've tried everything Turning the phone and watch on and off to resync. Even set it up again entirely. Already spent too much time on this. Had ordered a second one also. If it has the same problem, will have to send them back.",1
1,Love my new Versa 2! Replaced my previous Ionic. It looks much nicer and I absolutely love the Alexa integration. The only thing I wish the app supported was to easily switch between my Ionic and the Versa 2 depending on which I’m wearing. I’m sure it would even be technically possible for the app to detect the right one and switch to it.,5
1,"This is my first Fitbit product, and 2.5 weeks with it, I am quite pleased. I had a worry about it syncing with my Galaxy s10e, but it worked smoothly- whether it was because the just work well together, or because I didn't have the app downloaded until I set up the watch, but either way, they work well. Emails and texts come through great, sleep tracking seems accurate, and the steps count is close. It uses about 15-20% a day on battery life (full 24hr), so I usually charge it every 3-4 days. I have not setup Spotify, so I will update both battery and usage when I do.I do recommend, but suggest to get a screen cover for it, and be prepared for not many accessories available that fit right now because it is still so new.",4
0,Every now and then this thing changes time zone and it is really annoying to go back to the actual time zone. Battery lasts at most 3 days. Alexa integration is poor. Heart beat measurements and sleep scores not accurate. In simple words: I am dissatisfied.,1
0,"I ordered this Fitbit versa 2 almost 2 months before his birthday in august. After giving it to him he wore about a week and he just didn’t care for it. I looked up the return date and it said Jan 31, 2022. Trying to return today and it said the time to return is past. I don’t understand!!",1
0,Pretty disappointed that it doesn’t connect and stay connected to the note 10+ apparently it’s about the only note phone that it isn’t compatible with. I did get a refund on it so it wasn’t terrible. Wish they could get it to where it would stay connected.,1
0,Don’t buy. Fitbit no longer works with Apple phones. Can’t receive texts on the watch despite hours of trouble shooting. Shouldn’t it be the maker’s job to make their watch’s features function with apple. I’ve owned fitbits for many years. This will be my last,1
1,I went upstate for 5 days without my charger and the watch didn't die! Big improvement from my Blaze. I love the heart rate monitor and the fact that it's waterproof. It also sits more comfortably on my wrist compared to older Fitbit models. The only complaint was that Spotify was a bit tricky to setup.,5
1,I've always had problems with getting rashes where the watch head rests on my wrist but I haven't gotten one with this one. This one also feels a lot like having an apple watch.,5
1,"I recently upgraded from the blaze to this versa 2. I love it, I've been keeping it on all day even when I sleep, app work fine. It truly is a great watch.",5
0,Purchased as a gift and it no longer charges. She had a prior version of fit bit before and had no issues so have to believe this one has some problems. It’s only a year and a little over a month old so definitely not worth the money if it goes out that fast.,2
1,"Wanted this to remind me to get out of my seat and walk more at work. The reminder serves this purpose well! Nice free watch faces, handsome watch.",5
0,1st day connected to my phone great. After charging each time I had to uninstall and reinstall the app. It should have been spot on since my phone is the same operating system as the watch. I returned the watch after the 2nd charge. Very disappointed.,1
0,I had this watch for exactly 30 days and it went black amd green screen. Thank God I bought protection coverage . Fitbit replaced it but Amazon would not... Thanks Fitbit for honoring your coverage contract..,2
0,"So disappointed. Worked great 2 months, then would not sync or would start, then failed. Would not light up at all. Never got wet- wasn’t dropped blah blah blahHad my Alta fir 3 years- but they don’t make anymore. Don’t waste your money on Versa 2",1
1,"The battery life on the Fitbit versa 2 is amazing. I wear mine everyday all day and rarely charge it! I have swam with it on and have had 0 issues. I love the options to get notifications from your phone. Sometimes I have to disconnect and reconnect the versa to my phone to get all the notifications at times, but that’s really the only downfall I can speak of!",5
1,"I’m so disappointed! I purchased & received my Fitbit in December. I started having issues in March with the screen being black & not alerting me to phone calls. I called Fitbit. They walked me through some troubleshooting & sent a replacement. Today, May 17 (6 months later). I called again, spoke with a representative. I’m having to mail it back for them to troubleshoot the problem with my device. This is SO UPSETTING bc I literally never take it off other than bathing.At this point I wounot recommend this Fitbit.",5
1,"I love the Fitbit itself. I mainly use it to track steps, see my heartrate, track flights of stairs, and track my sleep. I also like that I can ""challenge"" friends to see who can get the most steps in.I rated it 4 stars since unfortunately the band caused some skin irritation after wearing it. I'm sure I can get a new band (that will cost me more money sadly).",4
1,"This has great health monitoring functions which is why I bought this for my wife last Christmas. But surprisingly it also integrates with her Samsung phone and she can see and respond to messages even though the phone is in her purse.As far as reliability, it has been working flawlessly since.",5
1,"Love my new Fitbit Versa 2. Love the way it looks. I picked the rosegold with pink band. Awesom. It has motivated me to walk and exercise more. Love it. I really like all the added apps on here like the sleep app that's awesome, great purchase",5
1,"it's clunky, and I feel like it should be flatter. It's a dome shape on the underside so it hurts my wrist and I constantly have to keep adjusting it to feel comfortable. you cant tighten it to a comfortable spot at all. it does everything else very well, but the battery life is less than three days. its 2 full days and a half.",3
1,Being more disciplined by tracking my exercise keeps me motivated to keep moving. Also I am able to see my sleep patterns and realize that I am not really getting to good sleep needed and of course tracking my water usage and realizing I am not drinking as much as I should. Really enjoying wearing this Fitbit Versa 2.,5
1,"If you’re even a slightly-moderately sweaty person when you work out, the versa 2 will never be accurate or tracking HR, no matter what you try (picture...HR definitely didn’t drop suddenly to below zones, I got sweaty and my Fitbit was like “idk what’s happennnnning”) . This is so frustrating for a smart watch DESIGNED to track fitness. I’ve tried everything and it never is accurate when I’m working out. I just got the 2, but had the first versa and it worked great for a year and a half before the HR function started going crazy. So I figured I’d get the 2 since the first one was so great. NOT impressed.",3
1,Every single time I move my arm it counts it as a step so it’s a little off. Then I pay 150 for a watch and it doesn’t make a single noise?! The most basic and cheap watch at Walmart makes a noise. I do like the watch still and it lasts for days. But I may switch to an Apple Watch.,4
1,So far the watch has been good. I love all of the watch faces to select from. The watch is easy to sync and get set up. It has all the features I don't like that the glass screen protector does not fit ther curved edges of the watch so it isn't protected like I would like. The only other complaint I have would be that sometimes my notifications vibrate and show on my watch and sometimes they don't. The battery life is fantastic! That is way more important to me than notifications so I'm not too upset about the small issues.,4
1,"I am not having issues with mine, but there are a lot of people who have issues that include them being dead. It took me about a week to figure out how to get mine to give me notifications from my phone.I would not purchase this again at this time. From what I have seen customer service is almost nonexistent.",3
0,This is the second one since January . Arrived as replacement first week of February. Has already quit functioning as of April 17. Total crap do not buy . Will not sync to any phone or connect through BT . Fitbit acknowledge a fault on their end as to why watch will not function . But no fix or replacements or warranty .,1
1,I’ve had several Fitbit’s and this version is a winner! The battery life is a huge improvement and don’t have to charge it like everyday! The look and feel is a great improvement. I like it so much going to start walking again! Had this for awhile and very pleased with all the options if you want a great exercise watch buy this one!,5
1,I already had a Fitbit versa. I wore it everyday for the past two plus years. I wanted to get a new watch with some extra features and my old watch’s face was scratched. Love the new watch but the extra band was missing. It was a large and I’m a small so it didn’t matter but I didn’t get what I paid for,3
0,"I'm so mad at Fitbit. I bought the vers2, it was delivered in Feb. It will not sync. I have restarted my phone, deleted the app and started again, and finally did factory reset. Nothing worked. This was very expensive to stop working after 8 months. Switching to Samsung",1
0,"I've had mine for over a year and loved it up until very recently. I took it off and while sliding it off my wrist, without touching the screen the screen popped right off! I'm over a year so it's not covered but only 2 months over. Worked great up until now and apparently this is a common problem.",2
1,"Screen on my wife's FitBit I bought through Amazon Services falls out now. I cannot get FitBit to honor warranty because I bought through Amazon - they say Amazon is responsible for warranty issues. Apparently Amazon doesn't cover the device for the 1yr; when I tried to click on support it says support expired six months before the 1yr period expires. Jacked up. Lesson learned, buy devices from retail if you want full warranty coverage.",3
0,"My Fitbit stopped tracking accurately after 10 months of use. I bought it in December 2019. Stopped working November 2020. It didn't record runs, didn't record walks. I complained about it and they did nothing about it. Told me to restart it, etc. I complained some more, made phone calls, wrote emails. Nothing. In February 2021 they finally got back to me and told me my warranty ran out, so all they can do is to offer a pathetic discount code for another watch. No thank you. Never again. Faulty product and very dissapointing customer care. Would never recommend it.",1
0,I don’t think watch is accurate re steps and calories. I do not wear at night while s.eepomg. Put watch on and said I had burned 631 calories and had 10 steps. Don’t think so. I didn’t really trust that it was waterproof.,2
0,I got this watch for my fiance in march 2021. It is now jan 2022 and the watch is completely fried. It went dead one day and he plugged into the charger and it wont do anything else. We bough a new charger and everything and it will not do anything. Do not purchase.,1
1,"I just love this little gadget I just hate you have to sync it every time the battery go down.I gave a four-star for accuracy only when the battery go down the time is wrong, but other than that it’s perfect.",5
0,"Don’t buy a FITBIT device. I had the Charge 3 and it last 14 months. It never really worked right. Unfortunately, I then made the decision to buy the Versa 2. It too had the same problems as the Charge 3. Sometimes would sync with the phone for messages and calls. I spent a couple hours on the phone and with emails with their support team to no avail. I switched to Garmin! Great watch, right from the start.",1
1,Great gift for Mother’s Day to replace an old tracker. The screen is big enough to read (without readers!) and the features are great for a basic tracker. The battery life leaves a little bit to be desired (thus the 4 stars) but it doesn’t seem to be too big of an issue. Love that this is water resistant too.,4
1,If you have used a Fitbit before it’s exactly the same. The app works great (iPhone) and I have no issues with notifications. You can go in and pick what you want notified on the watch through the app only after the first notification it receives. Tracks my sleep better than the previous fitbits. Average battery life is almost 6 days on a full charge with always on turned off. Tracking workouts is easy and the heart rate works great,5
1,I like just about everything I have tried. Alexa gives me kind of a hard time. Every now and then it tells me I have to complete installation on my mobile device then sync the Versa 2. I think it may happen if I get too far from my phone. Blood pressure is right on. Only had it about 2 weeks so I have not explored it's full potential,4
1,"I enjoy the features. Bad thing is that the weather app rarely works, and when I sync repeatedly it still is not reliable. The sleep sync does not seem to work completely. Otherwise, the other apps are a bonus I refer to it often.",4
0,"Purchased this Versa 2 in July, it completely stopped working by mid Sept. Watched all the YouTube videos to reset it, screen stays black. Put it on charger for the night, screen still black. Purchased new charger, screen still black. Passed the 30 day return window. Just be aware if you purchase through Amazon.",1
1,"My first smart watch, and it’s honestly been a great purchase. My favorite feature of this watch is the sleep tracking, which shows your sleep cycle at night and gives you a sleep score (might be a premium feature, which it gives you a free trial of). You can have it give text and phone call notifications, and works well as a wake up alarm. And I like all the different clock screens, mine is a pimp-boy from Fallout with a picture of my ferret in a carhartt beanie.",5
0,"WARNING DO NOT BUY...PRODUCT IS WORTHLESS. This product worked less then one month and I have contacted support multiple times. It will not hold a charge, it does not give accurate feedback (walked over 2 miles and had a busy day and it reported I took 1728 steps....easily was a 10k step day), sleep report is all over the board and frequently does not record the night sleep! I have contacted the company multiple times and they string me along!! The company will not replace their product or give me my money back. DO NOT BUY!! JUST SPEND THE ADDITIONAL MONEY AND GET AN IWATCH!!! At least they actually stand behind their product for a year!!!",1
0,"Their replacement policies when their watch malfunction is very poor. the only option is to ship the watch back, which they pay for but no expedite there, and then after reception it's 5 to 10 days extra for replacement... at the price you pay, you would expect a better quality or at least a better service.Will shop Apple next time",2
1,"This is the second FitBit tracker I've owned, my first being a Charge HR that I didn't want to part with. I was nervous about buying a FitBit smartwatch, but after having it for a few days I am definitely a convert! One of my big issues of my HR was that every few days the skin underneath the band would feel raw. I haven't had this problem with my Versa 2 at all. Even better, it's incredibly functional. I love the setup and the options to customize it. My favorite feature is the ability to track exercise straight from the Versa rather than the app. It's an incredibly well-designed product and if you're on the fence about it, order it!!!",5
1,I upgraded to this model because I'm a swimmer and wanted to wear it in the pool. Its great for that option and hot tub too. No complaints!,5
1,I’ve had this watch for over a year and I’m so happy with the purchase. I love all the tracking features and ability to connect with your cell phone. You can customize the settings based on what you use most. I got additional bands to mix up the looks. The screen hasn’t scratched yet either. I have submerged it in a pool multiple times and it holds up perfectly. I’m very happy with this watch and I know it has made me more active!,5
1,"This product seems super cool. However, the heart rate monitor does not read through my tattoos on my non-dominant arm. I have tattoos on both wrists. My dominant arm is much lighter and there are clear inaccuracies of the readings (jumped from 56-110 out of nowhere).Called support and the first question they asked was ""do you have tattoos"". Seems like it should be a disclaimer in their product description. Unreal honestly.",3
0,"I've been a Fitbit user for nearly 4 years. I was excited to get my new Versa 2, however I've only had it 3 months and it doesn't work. It's never been dropped or handled carelessly. I am very unhappy with this product. A huge waste of over $200!",1
1,I don't like that the watch does not count your steps unless your arm is moving. If you are pushing a grocery cart it doesn't count. I bought mine to help me keep moving . I also don't like the plastic wrist band,3
0,"They are saying I damaged it, and therefore won't replace. At first, they said problem on their end and will fix it or replace it. I do not like being told I damaged it and therefore they will not replace it. They are not telling the truth. I thought they were a reparable company, but they are not. I will never purchase their products again. I want another watch, not the same one. I am very disappointed.",1
1,"Requires $10 month subscription to use advanced features. This is a deal breaker. Sleep tracking and many other features require a monthly or annual subscription. Also, to do almost anything you must have an online account, it won't do anything without it.",3
1,"LOve my new fit bit. Holds a charge greater than 3 days. My smsung smart watch lasted a day!!! Love the band. It was alittle expensive but a lot cheaper than the Samsung watch>> I would recommend to any one that wants to see how many steps u r taking, Heart rate, sleep pattern and multiple other things. Simply love it!!",5
0,"I've had the smart watch for about 6 months, and it stopped working properly within a month and a half of getting it, (time which my warranty expired). The screen became unresponsive and it kept rebooting on its own. Nevertheless, i could still get my stats, but now it has completely stopped working. It wont sync with my phone, if i press the reset button the logo appears but wont ""turn on"". The only thing the manufacturer can do is ask me to ""please press the reset button for 10 secs until the logo appears"" and hope it works.",1
0,"I got this in January and in the last week it has started acting funny. It will freeze occasionally and the apps, such as exercise, won’t open any more. It worked great for several months but over the last few weeks it has randomly froze and currently only the time page is working",1
1,I LOVE THIS!!!! Has a nice big screen and works perfectly. I haven’t taken it off (besides to charge it) since I got it! Just ordered new bands for it today so it can go with every outfit. Such a good purchase. Only thing is I wouldn’t get the insurance it offers cause it’s not apple insurance and assurance sucks!!!,5
1,Great smart features for working out as you can program what type of exercise you are doing - my last fit bit did not record any gym activities. It also has a large bright face which I can actually read in the sun. I'm very happy with this purchase!,5
0,"I'm definitely not impressed and it's not worth what I payed for it. I can't use certain features, like paying with it and the app sucks ass! It took me a cpl of hrs to set it up cuz it keps saying that the website is down. I wish I could give it less then a star for the app. I'm thinking about returning it.",2
0,"I bought this new Versa 2 fitbit, and since I set it up the battery life doesn't last 24hrs. I've had it for less than a month and I called their product support and they asked to let it drain 3 to 4 times more in order for them to see that the battery is not working. Very disappointing with FitBit product support. I suggest buying the Apple Smartwatch instead of the Versa 2.",1
1,"I like the technology and the options of sleep tracking and app integration. However, I don’t like the continuing rash and blistering. Is the band made of nickel? That’s the only thing I know I’m allergic to.",3
1,My wife and I got these for Christmas 2019. It is now August 2020. The 2 we purchased are still working great. We have not had any problems with them. The heart rate is a little high but we take that into consideration. Overall we are very happy with the watches.,5

0,"Had issues with syncing, Alexa, and notifications. Be sure you research to see if this new products is compatible with your electronic devices (phones, tablets, etc.) Apparently there are issues with some older devices that are not compatible with the Versa 2.

0,"Really disappointed with the quality of this watch. My son has had two of these watches in less than three months. The first ones band broke, so we got it replaced. The second one now just won’t turn on. It’s an expensive watch that should last longer than a month or two.",1
1,"Easy to use, get all my calls and texts without being attached to my phone. Tracks my sleep and steps. So I'm can be aware exactly what I'm doing.Just received second Fitbit, purchased as a gift for my husband. It supposed to be new but was obviously been taken out of the box. It was slid in backwards, the plastic screen covers that protect it weren't there. This dissatifying considering I paid full price for it. Here's hoping it functions properly. My still works great and I love it.",3
0,way too expensive for the lack of accuracy. the step function must be too sensitive because washing your hands results in taking a nice walk. and with the current pandemic it records false step several times a day.pretty basic for $200. missed my return window so a bit annoyed about that.,1
0,"Everything was great and well functioning, loved the stats, sometimes slow uploading to my phone and not always consistent would have to manually do it as the automatic sync would not always work. But then two weeks ago, I was having lunch and the screen poppped off the front of the watch and when I popped it back in the screen just was a frozen gray screen and no longer works. I can't find any contact infromation or way to contact them or a way to return. A lot of money for a litttle over 1 year of a working device.",1
1,I love the MobileFitbit app and loveThe size of the Fitbit and Don’t like that it doesn’t have gps Built-in. And I don’t like you have to pay for Fitbit premium to get some of the benefits. But you got a free 90 day trial so that’s good I like that part.,4
1,I just survived a stroke. In purchasing this I have a step count and heart rate at anytime. It also tells of my sleep quality. These are all wonderful tools in helping me keep track of my health.,5
0,Do not purchase as this product is hazardous and caused skin irritation and burn and a small puncture. First thing I’ve ever gotten from amazon that I’ve had to write a bad review about. This was a Valentines Day gift to my husband and end up being not a good one.,1
1,I have had different styles of Fitbit trackers from 2011 until now. This is by far my favorite. It saves me time with a quick look to see who has called or is calling or texting. I love that! It also lets me add my water as I drink and workout. I am not a techie. I’m a retired elementary teacher. This is easy without stress. I recommend it.,5
0,"I love the watch, but after only 6 weeks, my battery is acting like a phone does when the battery is old. It makes wide decreases in battery life and it didn’t do that when it was brand new. Find myself charging every third day when it used to be 5-6.",2
0,"Looks good but only charged once, and will not change now. And has never charged again. I purchased for a birthday gift. Now this expensive gift is not working and I can't get a refund because it's past 30 days this merchandise is trash and I'm ashamed that I gave it as a gift.",1
1,Love this works great! Even the sleep app. is useful. May not be completely accurate but kind of cool to be able to see how I sleep each night. This is a winner purchase.,4
1,Still not sure im keeping it. It can hardly read my pulse ox/oxygen saturation. Somwtimes it works sometimes it doesnt. I like the notices with texts & emails right to my watch... my wifes apple iwatch works flawlessly so we will see if i keep it.,3
0,"Idk what has happened but my screen went green, while charging btw, so it's not like I did anything to it. I have had it for about 9 weeks now and apparently the return window is 30 days.",1
0,"After a month and a half of using the limited edition Versa 2, it stopped syncing with the cel phone app. Continued using it until it run out of battery. Tried charging and it never came back to life. Waiting on Fitbit to respond for warranty.Also: I had turn on the option to activate the screen with motion, but it never worked; I always had to press the button on the left in order to see my stats.",1
0,I likes this when I first got it. I don’t usually wear it anymore. The band pinches my wrist. Also the notifications for when someone is calling or texting doesn’t ever work. I had hoped I would leave my ringer off because the watch would vibrate. But I can’t. I would never answer any work calls. I’m sad that I don’t like it because I was thrilled to buy it for myself.,1
0,"The face of the watch fell off and the watch stopped working. The circuit connector broke. I wasn’t doing anything when it happened. I liked the watch when it worked but now it’s garbage. Fitbit should stand by its products. I would never have bought it had I known that it will last only for two years. Overall, I liked the watch but the sleep tracking app never worked properly. I am switching to Apple Watch.",1
1,Grandson loved this Christmas gift. Fits all the things he wanted. He had it set up in a flash. Purchased the very affordable 3 year warranty.,5
1,Have had this for about 6 months and love it! Actually purchased a Fitbit previously that was almost $200 and returned it because this did the same thing and met my needs for a quarter of the price.,5
1,"This product operates less than perfectly. I have had numerous problems with the way if records, or fails to record, information. When positioned up against my cellphone, the phone tells me it can't locate a device! It will skip several days of recorded information, and then eventually it all shows up.",3
1,"I noticed my wrist gets itchy under the band. This time it left a big mark. I took my watch off last night at 8pm, it is now 8:30am and i still have the bright red mark and its itchy.Going to try a new band, but ive seen this happen to other people too.Cant listen to spotify on it. Just tells me that it controls spotify playing on another device.",3

0,"Not happy with this thing. Despite a hard reboot all the haptic and app reminders have stopped working. I haven’t even worn it for a year. I’m frustrated that it’s not keeping track accurately, and sometimes doesn’t sync with the app at all. Would not buy again.",2
1,Works great! I use it all the time to track my steps and to do the breathing exercise and it brings my heart rate down 4 beats!,5
1,"The media could not be loaded.
 I've had for 15 months & have always taken it off showering or going into the water. But now the screen in acting goofy. Like a TV that has lost its picture. I think this should have lasted longer than 15 months!",3
1,"I bought Fitbit 4 years ago, because I have a job that keeps me on the move and I wanted to track how many steps I got a day! I average between 15 to 20,000 steps a day now and I also workout. FitBit track my workouts as well. It’s also a huge benefit for me to track my heart rate since I have had heart issues in the past. The app is amazing. The one downside is that I don’t think it always tracks my sleep accurately though. Like it doesn’t include all the time, but fortunately there is a way you can edit it to include more time that you believe you slept. I have the versa to Fitbit and I just upgraded and got the oxygen-reading face for it",5
1,"I’ve had it several months and wear it most of the time except for when I’m charging it or bathing/washing dishes etc. About a month ago I started getting this red spot on my wrist. Even if I don’t wear it for 3-4 days at all and the spot goes away, as soon as I put it on again and wear it for 24 hours, it’s back. I take it off every time I wash my hands and the band gets wet and I dry it off thoroughly but it is still a problem. I’ve seen several other people with the same issue, maybe Fitbit should look into a different material for their bands.",3
0,I only had it for five months and it just stopped working. I took great care of the watch. It’s in perfect condition. It just stopped working. It won’t turn on. Very disappointing!!!,1
0,*update* microphone went out on it about a year after owning. Didn't do anything crazy like drown it or drop it to make it stop working.**I've been wearing this for about a month and so far so good. I haven't tried getting it wet. And connecting the apps/ Bluetooth can be a little confusing/frustrating. But I like it so far,2
1,The title says everything. In my opinion the Versa 2 is just as good as the Versa 3…and I found it easier to use than the new fitbit Sense.For the money I would choose Versa 2 anytime.,5
1,I love this watch! I never wanted to get a smart watch until my husband deployed. I wanted to make sure I never missed an update from him. So I caved. I'm also a nurse and find it much easier for provide updates using a texting app. I will never miss an update (all complying within the rules and regulations!)I love being able to do everything from my watch. It's perfect! I'm so glad I evolved with the times lol,5
0,"I got this in late October, and it’s already broken. This is the third Fitbit I’ve had that lasted less than a year so needless to say I’ll be switching to a smart watch that is cheaper and more reliable",2
0,"This worked for us for 3 months, then all the sudden when an update was available, it stopped syncing and wouldn't work with my phone, despite the Fitbit website saying my exact phone and software version were tested and supported. When I contacted Fitbit Support, they made me do a bunch of troubleshooting steps to no avail and told me they couldn't help at all after that. Such a waste. For this reason I won't purchase another Fitbit. If it stops working and they refuse to help, it's a ridiculous waste of money.",1
1,"I had a charge 2 that got cracked and gave out. I took a chance on the Versa 2 and am glad I did. A little more expensive, but not too pricey. It has more apps than I need, but find wallet, agenda, alexa, alarm, and weather useful. Because I am familiar with Fitbit, I did not consider any other brands.",5
1,"I had a Fitbit Blaze before for about 5 years & battery would hold charge anymore. I decided to go with the Versa since the features were similare. At first, the Versa altogether looks bigger but it's the same size. The screen bezel is smaller on the Versa, which means better screen display.",5

0,Very undependable Bluetooth. Does not sync all the time. Does not work on Alexa all the time. They only have a small list of phones that they say are confirmed to work with Versa 2. Don't trust that. Find a Pebble Time watch.,1

1,"I've been using the watch for 2 weeks now. I bought it mainly to keep track of my exercises. I was using a Xiaomi My Band 4 and was very happy overall but I wanted to have some additional features that I didn't have with that watch. In general terms I'm happy with the versa 2 but I have to points to criticize: 1. Don't know how accurate the steps and cals counter is (I suddenly started walking more and consuming more cals since wearing the Versa 2). and 2. The connected GPS feature simply does not work well. Bluetooth keeps disconnecting when using this feature so tracking is quite bad. Haven't found a way to solve this so far and I've tried everything. Other than 2 points, the watch work well.",4

I like the gamification aspect of it- it was sort of fun to see my heart rate when working out etc. My issue is that its just a toy- the steps and floors and heart rate data is inaccurate. At the end of the day I wanted something accurate and not a toy. So I quit using it.,3
1,I like it how it combines all my fitness. I have been a lifelong Apple user but not when it comes to watches. New apps make it work better than my ionic. Has a fine my phone feature which I love. Battery lasts forever. Definitely have improved the technology.,5
1,I am not sure how accurate the heart readings are. Specifically the O2 reading. It doesn't seem to update as often as my Versa Lite did.,3
1,"Along with the app this watch has helped me track my workouts, calories burned and calorie intake. I have now lost 25 pounds. Obviously the watch didnt make me lose the weight but it was a very key tool in helping me along this process to my first goal. I highly recommend it.",5
0,"Loved the watch. Battery lasts 5 days, worked well, until it stopped swiping. I've had it 32 days. I worked with fitbit techs and nothing helped. They are sending me a replacement. This seems to be a common problem with the Versa 2.",1
1,Happy with purchase. Love having the insight right on my wrist. Motivates me to be more active by getting my steps in and more conscious of my calorie consumption. Only complaint is it has trouble syncing almost every morning. Otherwise happy with purchase and glad I bought it.,5
0,"This fitbit is very misleading. Before purchasing I read that you can play music from it, however all you can do is control spotify from the fitbit and if you have your own music downloaded(which idk who does that anymore)you can bluetooth to a speaker or headphones to play the music. The advertising makes it seem as if you can okay the music directly from your wrist. So it's very disappointing. I am also having trouble with the spotify app in general on this fitbit.",2
0,"I bought this for my husband as a birthday gift and just gave it to him. After a weekend of attempts to get it to turn on, it never worked. I am unable to return it and feel completely deflated and wasted a lot of money on this.I would love a refund or a replacement for him.",1
1,I have to admit I really didn't look at the details prior to purchasing this device. However for what it is it serves its purpose. if you're looking for a smartwatch that is fitness and health driven this is a perfect product at an affordable price to start. However if you're looking for a smartwatch that allows you the ability to download apps from the Google play store. this would not be the watch for you. I would definitely search for a watch that is OS where capable. Just something to think about prior to purchasing.,3
1,I like fitbit because my friends and family have them so we can compare. Not sure if it is the watch or my phone but I have problems connecting sometimes. Which of course means Alexa doesn't work when I cannot connect. Overall I would buy again.,4
0,"I will never buy another Fitbit. Both mine and my lady’s watch have multiple different problems. The latest won’t let me charge without resetting indefinitely. Then when I get it back on, holding the button freezes the watch. I have now strapped a rock to my wrist as a sundial for the time. Getting mixed results from that but still better than Fitbit.",1
1,It works fine for the most part. Definitely not water resistant. My wrist gets wet while washing dishes and I end up with an angry red burn mark from the charging port :( cant believe it would be safe to swim or shower in. Sleep tracker is mediocre i often find it unreliable and the hours i slept wrong.,3
1,I was skeptical after some reviews and previous bad experiences with less expensive smart watches. They would always disconnect from my phone. This stays connected. I love the customization of the displays. Fits comfortably and not as bulky or painful as others I've tried.,5
1,"I am now very pleased with My Fitbit Versa 2. I was having issues but after contacting Fitbit it is working fine now. Hopefully it will continue. My Fitbit Versa 2 (which I purchased in May 27, 2020)",4
1,"I wear my Versa 2 almost all the time and really enjoy having the tracker and notifications. But one of the features I thought would be the most useful is Alexa on my arm. It is almost impossible to keep the watch and the Alexa skill functioning. If the app closes it stops working and you normally have to go through a whole manual sync to get it back up. Even you are super careful and make sure the app stays open, randomly Alexa will not respond. I have gone through the Fitbit forums and read the advice of others. All the steps outlined will work for a short period but will at any given time fail. Bottom Line: if you want a smart assistant on your watch buy an iWatch.",4
1,"I expected more out of sleep tracking , rem sleep etc ,Bayern life is greatI still feel it’s too expensive, around $100 is a fair pricing",3
1,I love my Fitbit I don't rely on it to know my physical state all that much but it does keep you motivated and great at keeping tabs on your activity level throughout the day. It keeps me motivated and makes me want to focus on bettering myself,5
1,"I have no idea how I didn’t have one sooner. Battery life is amazing, I’ve been using mine for 2 days straight without charging and it’s still on 89% life. All of the features are accurate and really interesting. Absolutely recommend.",5
1,"The Always-On feature sold me and is also why I am returning it. This feature will only display the time. It is supposed to display battery percentage but doesn't work right now (maybe a OS problem). If you have a custom watch face, this is NOT always on. I tried to contact support to see if there was a known issue with the settings but they were no help. I miss my old pebble.",3
0,"The Fitbit itself works well as a pedometer and watch. I'm also enjoying the sleep tracking when I can get the app to work.However, even after the app updates, I get ""Cannot find device"" errors when trying to sync my Fitbit to my phone app. Which means I can't easily track sleep. I haven't even tried some of the extra features since the phone app won't sync.",2
1,"The media could not be loaded.
 This is really a nice upgrade from my fitbit Adidas edition, love the voice reply on text.The only problem is that it keeps on loosing signal due to app not sincyng .. thats a total headache",5
1,I only had it for 20 seconds before I found out this was the same watch my mother in law bought for her husband ... which is what I was gonna buy for Xmas so ... returned it. No point giving him two watches lol but it looked solid and good to me. I didn’t have a chance to fiddle with it and see what it can do but it looked amazing,5
1,"I’m so glad that I bought this! I love it so much. I compared mine to my coworkers Apple watch & other coworkers smart watch to see how similar our step count was cause we move around about the same amount and they were all pretty similar give or take if some of us moved a little more than others, so I’m happy about that!",5
0,"I just looked up my purchase date on Amazon of my Versa 3 and I just receive it on June 7th 2020. It started glitching a week or two ago. I reported it to Fitbit, expecting them to immediately replace it. A Fitbit rep said my account was flagged, meaning I had to return the watch to them for evaluation. I paid $150.00 for it and now it's open ended as to when I'll get a watch to use. When I bought it, it showed up within 2 days. Now when there's a problem, they have my money and I don't have a watch. This will not motivate me to want another Fitbit.",2
0,"This Watch did not work properly from day one . Would never connect to my iphone even though I had reinstalled app many times to try to fix. Had to connect via usb to my computer. (I could not get any phone messaging because would not connect to phone). Also, every time the battery died and then recharged battery, the time would show what appears to be a random time. My old fitbit did not not have these problems. Terrible product. The only good aspect of product is that the heart-rate monitor worked well.",1
1,"I bought this on July 11, 2021 and I am just now leaving a review. I upgraded from a Fitbit Charge. Overall I love the Versa 2. I went on Vacation on August 26th and just returned home on September 2nd. The battery lasted the entire time for me and I didn't have the charger with me. By the time I got home on September 2nd, I had about 9% battery remaining. I think that the battery is pretty good in my opinion and very satisfied.",5
1,"I’ve always been a Fitbit user and the versa2 special edition doesn’t disappoint. It’s got so many watch faces to choose from, I love the new active minutes, and I am really enjoying this set up for a Fitbit. Easy to wear and change bands if needed.",5
1,"Works great, battery last 3 to 4 days. Love it!!!! Love all the features and that I can change the clock faces. Many free options.",5
1,"Will not work with SAMSUNG where my previous Fitbit would not work with my LG phone, this one became mine because it does not work with my wife's SAMSUNG it works with my LG Stylo 4I have a Second previous Fitbit Versa that seems to not work with any phone we have.",5
1,"The items itself seems to work, it's cool to see how many steps I've taken or my heart rate (helps with workouts), but my main issue is that the band it came with broke in the first 3 days. It comes with a cheap plastic (rubber?) band and the clasp is hooked in by 2 pegs on either end... well, the pegs broke through the plastic.A lot of cool, useful things about the product, but I'd add another $15-$20 to what you expect to pay so you can have a replacement band.",3
1,The mobile app is kinda complicated as well as my watch isn’t counting outdoor steps but it’s counting indoor makes no sense. I’ve reset it twice already! Not sure what else I can do to fix it. Other than that I like how light weight and stylish it looks just wish it worked efficiently,3
0,This doesn’t work with iPhones for text. One of the main reasons I bought this was for the text feature. I called their support and they know there is an issue and have had the issue without a fix since September.,1
1,Wonderful watch but it lasted a year and a half before the touch screen randomly stopped responding its like it's not calibrated and I cannot get it to work anymore,4
1,"This fitbit was on my daughter's wishlist for her birthday. It wasn't until she opened her gift that I heard she wasn't sure it was what she really wanted! Thankfully, it was all she had hoped for and more! (Even the color!!)",5
0,I bought my watch and it didn't even last a year. The screen went completely blank and I am unhappy about the cost. My Casio lasted several years,1
1,I love my Fitbit versa 2. I haven't had many issues. Its pretty accurate. My only issue is that once in awhile I had to shutdown it down so it'll sync to my fitbit app. What I like best is that I can go a week before i have to charge it. The steps have become more accurate the more i wear it. The sleep tracker is nice. Heart rate is really accurate. Haven't tested out if it really is water resistant yet. Overall I recommend this!,5
0,It’s ok for tracking sleep. Anything more is useless. The Alexa app is basically unusable. It constantly disconnects from the Versa. I pretty much use it to tell time and as a glorified sleep tracker. And with Alexa when it works 5 times out of 100.,2
0,Worked great until it didn’t. I loved my Versa until it stopped working less than a year after purchase. Now it won’t respond to certain touch commands in the exercise menu. Product reliability is not where it should be at all.,2
1,"Excelente! Desde que lo uso, estoy más consciente de mi salud y de mantenerme ejercitada.El seguimiento a las horas de sueño es muy bueno!También reconoce, sin necesidad de hacerlo en el app, el ejercicio, su duración y la efectividad del mismo.Lo recomiendo ampliamente",5
1,Love this watch. App could be better. I do keto and if it was able to calculate net carbs when logging food would be very helpful. Otherwise logging my food tracking my calories it helped me guide my way to significant weight loss total of 57lbs. I put in the hard work but watch helped track everything.,5
1,Style,5
0,"Often times when I am working out my heart rate will not read accurately. I'll be sweating bullets and my fitbit will say my heart rate is way lower than it actually is, which in turn does not calculate calories burned accurately. I will check my heart rate on the exercise equipment I'm using and it could be registering 150 on the machine and only like 98 on my fitbit. It's very frustrating.",2
0,"As of today (May 6 2020) this device is *not* compatible with new samsung s20+ (and I guess s20) I confirmed with their support team, and wasn't able to sync it with my phone. Be aware and probably either want to wait for a while or buy something else if you have samsung s20 phone",1
0,"I bought this watch in January 2021 and have used it every day of the year. It was working just fine but yesterday, (April 28), i went on a hike for a few hours and when i came home, the screen was blank or just had some streaks of green lines on it. So, i have had the watch for only 4 months and it has already broke. There was no sign of weakening or misfunction before this. It was an all of a sudden thing. The only thing that was off a little was the steps. at times, i would walk about a quarter mile without the steps changing.",2
1,The sleep tracker was eye opening. I didn’t realize how often I was waking at night. I have gotten into a routine of using the meditation components of the app to improve my sleep,5
1,I liked the watch fine until the touchscreen stopped working after just over two years. And I’ve had the watch for about 27 months.,3
0,I try to get music on it and it’s literally impossible. Not worth the price when I can’t use Pandora or anything. And what’s the point of getting texts on it when you can’t reply or getting calls when you can’t talk off of it.,1
1,I was replacing another model. I love this Versa 2. It sit's low and it posts in color. Amazing that the battery life is about 6 days depending on how many apps you are running. Water resistant also.,5
1,"I ordered the fitbit for the purpose of sleep tracking. Upon receiving the product, I followed the instructions, but the fitbit firmware to activate the watch would not update, and as a result I was unable to use it. I tried every troubleshooting solution known, and worked with fitbit to fix the problem, to no avail. Bummer.Update: It ended up working! This thing is pretty cool!",4
1,"Works well. I was having syncing issues after a month, just had to reinstall the app and that fixed the problem. I wish there were more compatible apps like for banking, messaging options, etc. I do love the Alexa preinstalled. Hoping they update over time and make her more accessible like at home besides alarms and reminders.",4
1,"I feel like it tracks my steps better than the Apple watch did - I got a Google Pixel 3 and gave my Apple watch to my kid... Definitely not super smart - I don't like that I can't create a new message on my watch via Alexa, but it does the job when responding to texts I receive when my phone isn't in my hand.",5
0,"I do not recommend this product. disposable. It only lasted 6 months, I am very careful with my watches, I do not recommend it. 😭",1
0,"The media could not be loaded.
 It works great for a couple months but the screen freaks out and restarting it doesn’t help. So I got a replacement, and that also broke after a few months. Definitely not worth your money.",1
1,Like comfortable easy to read. Multiple functions easy to use.Use HR will playing tennis. Steps for our daily walk . Coupled will phone distance is aslo helpful.Hopefully it still works after swimming and snorkeling. Got it for Christmas Still too cold in De.,5
1,"My versa 2 is an integral tool in my fitness and health tracking. Only complaints are....1. O2 tracking is still unavailable after updating and supposed roll-out by Fitbit. 2. Would be nice if there was a simple way to pause step tracking while driving. You have to log driving to remove counted steps or place it on the charger to stop counting. An option to just ""pause"" with one click would be great.",5
1,"I would like it to work for everyone's workout. I don't run, right now I'm riding the bike at the gym, so no credit on workout/steps. I make sure to move my arms as I ride or have my hand on my leg to get a ""step count"" for the 45 minutes I'm working out. Also, not all women (any age) have a menstrual period, wish I could have the option to delete or not see it at all since it does not pertain to me. EXTREMLY HARD to figure out how to sync up to control music, still haven't figured out so can't use it for that yet.",4
1,The product while not unusably difficult to use is Not Intuitive enough.Quite a learing curve. May because it has alot of features.I bought it for Sleep Tracking. After a month I am still trying to get consistent operation.,4
1,"When I first turned on my FitBit, I had the HARDEST time connecting it to my Galaxy S9. The devices couldn't see each other.I tried all the steps to fix it and it didn't work. I eventually fixed the blutooth connectivity issue by deleting all my other blutooth connections. That was very obnoxious. But other than that, the actual product has been stellar! No complaints from me! If you sweat easily though, I'd probably suggest buying a non-silicone band. The band that the Versa comes with is rubbery and can trap moisture under it.",5
0,"My fitbit stopped working after 3 months. The screen does not work or respond to touch. Sometimes, it turns itself on or off without being prompted to do so. It still tracks my sleep somehow, but I'm not able to access the other features because the screen part is broken and unresponsive. I'm really upset, this was one of the more expensive fitness trackers on the market and I expected more in terms of quality from this.",2
0,"We bought this for my daughter for her cross country but she found it does not rate distance and heart rate accurately. Compared to her team mates she runs with, hers is always a shorter distance than theirs and the heart rate also seems to be inaccurate compared to other watches. It looks nice and works well, but you can’t count on the data it gives.",2
1,Good for fitness and sleep tracking. Good connection to phone for alerts and reminders.Still exploring other capabilities,4
1,"Love what this smart watch has to offer. Motivates me, interesting fasts, (#of sleep hours, oxygen, workout...) and other apps that I personally don’t use. Nice size display for a person newly needing readers. Was my bday gift and it didn’t break the bank for what it comes with.",5
0,"Right out of the box it wouldn't connect to Bluetooth. All the troubleshooting involved repeated blah blah of resetting watch, phone, updating app, updating phone. Nothing works. Never even got to try the thing out! Also the app has a 3.7 rating all because of these very common sync issues.",1
0,"Hate this fitbit. Won't update successfully. Won't charge on my multiple old versa chargers. The new charger is not good. You cannot tell if it is actually charging, and it is clunky and has to sit sideways when the versa is in it.",1
0,"Such a disappointment. Lasted for less than a month, before having problems linking the watch to my Fitbit account. Wish I would've researched this further before purchasing. Then I would've seen all the negative reviews indicating the same problems, and the need for endless replacements. Tried everything to fix, with no success.",1
1,My husband and I each got one for the other for Christmas. We love them. The large face is great. I love the sleep tracking and the reminders to get up and move a bit more at the end of each daytime hour. I like being able to change the clock face. I love receiving calls and text; makes me feel more free from my phone.,5
1,Helps with my sleep,5
1,This watch has an amazing battery life - it’s comfortable to wear. The heart rate and step counting is a favorite feature.,5
0,This was a very disappointing purchase. I will be returning it. It is very inaccurate with the step count. I was up to 7000 steps by the end of the day when all I did all day was sit and hold a newborn baby. I would guess I maybe should have had 1000 steps. I reached out to Fitbit and they have not been helpful.,1
0,The strap is really hard to change. I managed to detach one strap but I am not able to attach the larger strap so the product is now useless.I watched a YouTube video on how to attach it and let others try as well. No one was able to attach the strap. Even the video wonders why Fitbit would make it so hard to attach.You have to line up these three tiny pins in three different directions simultaneously. The pins are so delicate they can easily be bent making the product impossible to use. Right now it is so hard to attach that we are not sure if that hasn happened.Similarly if one tiny delicate pin on the charging port is bent it also cannot be charged.,1
1,Works grate at keeping track of how many steps I take a night. The free app for your phone is easy to use to set your own goals.,5
0,All of a sudden this stopped working and I have only had it one year. You could see some of the screens but not the main one with the time and total of steps. Very disappointed. Last one went after two years. If I purchase a new one this will be the third in theee years. Not good quality.,1
0,It won’t connect to our WiFi- tried everything suggested. Will probably return it.,1
0,"Hasn't even been two years, and the screen just fell off. When I pushed it back in, all I get is a bright white screen. Not worth the money.",1
1,This watch is nice and convenient. I would definitely give it 5 stars if it tracked my sleep better. It barely tracks it at all. I have a cheaper $30 tracker that doesn't have all of these nice features but it tracks my sleep very well. Just a heads up.,4
0,I bought this watch almost a year ago and still have not figured out how to use it I went on YouTube I had my friends help me with it and nobody can figure out I don't even know if it works and I know it's too late to return it so I lose,2
1,"I love my Versa 2, it keeps good track of my sleep habits and my work out outcomes. This watch is stylish easy to change bands for workout or dressed up, it's light weight with easy to read display. I highly recommend this watch for performance, style and price!",5
0,Had this for two years and a week and it does not track heart rate anymore. Nor does the touch screen work as well. I suggest you purchase from someone who can offer a warranty. Don’t waste your money here on Amazon!,1
1,So far I am loving the Versa 2. I got it on Tuesday charged it when I got it. Its now Saturday and I'm at 41%. I LOVE That the battery life is lasting longer. I also love the mic for the quick response.,5
1,Been wanting this for a long time. I am very satisfied with it so far. It was very easy to set up thank goodness. It has been very accurate so far. I would most definitely recommend it.,5
0,"I loved this watch/data tracker. However, after 1 yr and 4 months, the battery wouldn't stay charged. Previously, it would drain about 20-30% per day; very reasonable. All of a sudden, it would drain 100% per day. Of course, no warranty coverage. A watch that costs this much should not be unusable after 16 months.",1
0,"I bought the Versa 2 for my wife, I payed 200$ for a useless watch. The battery only lasts for 5 hours, even if I disable Bluetooth, sync and heart monitor.Costumer service has me walking in circles doing tests an syncing watch every couple of hours and its been useless so far...I WILL NOT CHANGE MY REVIEW UNTIL I GET A SOLUTION.",1
1,Favorite Fitbit I've owned so far. Screen is pretty durable and has no scratches after around a year of regular wear. Original band still in one piece with no signs of wear. I mainly use the timer and bluetooth notifications but they both work great.,5
1,"Nice device to keep track of your daily walking and activity to monitor. A solid 4/5 worst part is the application, Update it!?!?!",4
0,I'm changing my review for this product. I have to reboot this watch almost every day in order to get the touchscreen to work. It consistently stops responding to touch. The power off and Power on sequence doesn't take very long but it's an annoyance that has become a serious nuisance. I am contemplating returning the watch because of it.,2
1,"I like it quite a bit. KeepsMe motivated to get up throughout the day and I like when it automatically figures out some of my workouts. It does usually figure out my walks or runs, but sometimes it logs my walks as elliptical workouts. To avoid this you can choose what workout you are doing ahead of time. The only reason I’m not giving it 5 stars is because I have to charge mine about every 3 days.",4
1,"This watch has everything I wanted. I like WearOS watches but HATE having to charge them every day (if they last that long). This watch gives you notifications that you can reply to, a variety of watch faces (fun), wrist payments and Alexa.",5
1,Why didn’t I get one sooner? I love this watch!! It does everything it says it will. The only drawbacks are within exercise mode you can use no other apps And it doesn’t work quite as well with an iPhone.,5
0,Really love the reminder to move feature as well as the improved sleep feature but the fact that I can’t get the band to stay connected and it keeps popping out on its own and I have had this for less than 30 days I will probably be returning it for a different product,2
1,"I really like the features, especially the”find my phone”. I just got it, so there are more features to explore. I don’t like having “zone” minutes instead of regular minutes because I want to know how long I’ve been exercising/moving. My husband gets a sleep score and I don’t. Searched and can’t find out why.",4
1,"l9ve my fitbit i like how it keeps track of my steps n i gives me an alert when ive reached my goal,plus it tells me my heartbeat n also u can listen to ur music off of it using wireless headphones,n i love that it comes with alexa voice on it,u can ask it whatever n it sends u a text of ur answer",5
1,I love everything about the Versa 2. I had previously used a Fitbit Alta. The Versa does so much more. It has several different workout modes to use which us great because I'm a fitness instructor. I also love the Spotify control. This watch is very easy to use and the app is easy to understand.,5
0,"After having this product for less than a year, the battery life lasts for less than 1 dayOf course by the time I looked up the warranty, it was out of the 1 year warranty. “Luckily” I’d ordered asurion protection through AmazonNope, they returned it back to me with the same defective battery that lasts less than 1 day",1
0,"I gave this a 5 star in the beginning but as of February 2022 I now give it a 2 star. I purchased this end of June 2021 and to date the tracking function, sleep and heart rate, don't work. I have tried the recommended reset everyday for the past 3 days. Nothing works. Due to this being purchased off Amazon, I can not file under fitbits warranty. 😡",2
0,Good until it died 4 months after purchasing...,2
1,Great watch works as described. Only bad part is you you can't wear it while shooting a hand gun. The shock wave from the gun shot will destroy the microphone.,5
1,Great watch and does all the things I need. Wish they would rework how the bands attach. It’s very complicated to replace them when you want to change out.,5
1,Love love love. Everything I wanted and more! I love that I can change clock face and band whenever I want and it's like putting on a new accessory. Tried 4 different brands prior and none can hold a candle to this one. Bought my daughter one also and she loves it!,5
1,It has more features than my first fit bit. I can clearly see my text messages as well as the names of the callers. My first one stopped working after a month or so. So yes I am very happy with this one.😊😊😊,5
0,"I expected this to be a good smartwatch with ome features but I just hate it that there is so much ""in app"" purchases, you can do like half of what they announce, and for everything else you have to pay and it just sucks, I feel like instead of a smartwatch I paid to get in to a shopping mall, I really hate where so many products are heading nowadays",1
1,Fits well with small band. Accurate easy to read. Like the feature that turns the clock face off at night but with a flip of your wrist you can see the clock. Would highly recommend this product to anyone wanting a fitness tracker and smart watch.,5
1,"Love this item, works very well even easy to work with iOS. Have been using FitBits faithfully for years, glad to see this upgrade for me. Only reason it's not perfect is the screen controls can be a little confusing and the band that came with the fitbit broke pretty quickly.",4
0,"I had an older Fitbit , fell and broke about a year ago. Saw the Prime day deal on the Versa 2 and got it a few days ago. It won't track my heart rate or sleep , tried everything , still won't work.. I have decided to send it back and maybe try something else. It seems this is a common issue with this watch , I should have done a little more research before I made the jump.",1
1,"Had the Versa 2 for several weeks now and really like it. Bought the blue special edition upgraded band and it is very stylish + providing more information than my Charge2. Got 15 spiffy watch faces for $7 from 3rd party and shows weather/wind along with date, time, heart, steps, calories, battery life (which is multi days). Notifications are in color and the Alexa information actually works well. Solid product.",5
0,"Worked great for2 months, and I was totally in love with this thing. Then, all of the sudden, screen went black and ceased to work/charge despite restart attempts and troubleshooting (attempting to work with Fitbit for replacement). Did not hit or drop it in any way...middle of the night I went to check the time...and it was just black. Very frustrating.",2
1,"My wife had an older fitbit and fought getting this new one. Now she loves it. Larger screen, easy connection to her phone and relevant health information. She liked it so much I got one too.",5
1,Fit bit versa 2 is great. Has alot you can do on it. Steps. Exercise. Sleep. Love you can answer text from it. Bands are reasonably priced so you can change it out easily. You can have your emoji or pics as screensaver. Really cool.,5
1,"I love my versa 2-, but, the app doesn’t record active min in a timely manner, it’s probably the app. Takes a long period of time to record. Sometimes turning phone off to prompt recording. I have taken app off and re installed-works faster but is lazy sometimes",4
1,Originally I lived this watch but it unsynced for some reason and it won't resync so I'm missing out on a lot of the features... very disappointing.,3
1,I love this because it tracks my sleep and my activity. It does not allow you to text people back or answer calls but i do not need that as i just want to know when my phone is ringing as i usualy have my phone on silent or vibrate.,5
1,"I initially ordered a Versa 3 but it would NOT sync with my phone. The Versa 2 works perfectly, I can get my e-mails, texts, calls, weather, sleep, and so much more. I have an android phone btw.",5
0,"Bought two of these in December. One of them work, the other one doesn’t. I’ve tried using a new charger, the charger that came with the other watch, etc. it simply won’t stay on. Even if I can get it on, it will just turn off. Can’t figure out a way to charge it and have spent money on new chargers just to try to get it to work. Very disappointed.",2
1,"I love that the fit bit automatically tracks cycling as where the Garmin did not. The watch face has everything on it & it’s customizable. It’s waterproof, comfortable silicone & kinda leads my entire day",4
1,"Upgraded from my Charge 2 to this and have been extremely happy with it. The only issue I've found so far is that you cant use the watch for phone calls. You can answer the call with the watch, but you still have to use your phone to talk and listen.",5
0,"This watch is really nice I like it, but one of the reasons I bought it is because it had the Alexa added to it it, It does not work it has not worked nor do I think it will ever work. Check the net, hundreds of people that bought this watch have the same problem no Alexa. They should not advertise it to work with Alexa if it can't I have tried all the so-called fixes none of them work and I mean none of them",1
1,"Great watch for what I use it for. Wish it had more free clock faces. Had to stop sleeping with it on, as the band kept getting caught on stuff and I don't want to break it. Sometimes it does not sync and requires a restart of phone to get reconnected. Overall I find this watch useful for my needs.",4
1,"I love this watch. It has all i need with alarm, workout stats, connected to phone receiving messages and notifications, has spotify, has alexa to ask whatever question, has wallet stored credit for payment and some apps that makes things easier such as tip calculator etc. Overall happy with this watch not as expensive as the apple watch.",5
1,"I absolutely love my Fitbit Versa 2. I upgraded from the Fitbit Flex 2 and I’m so glad I did. With my in home workouts, I am able to use the Timer that’s installed for my aerobic workouts as well as lift weights. Another nice feature is being able to connect the Bitmoji app to the device so you can view the Bitmoji on the clock screen. I also enjoy using the “Relax” feature which tracks 2 minutes of yourself breathing (inhaling/exhaling) to determine if you’re calm or may need to take it easy. I definitely believe it’s worth getting.",5
1,The 2nd Versa 2 we have bought. We love them. Great watch and fitness tracker. Love the Amazon Alexa integration. Constantly use that. Love getting my messages on my wrist instead of having to pull out my phone. Couldn’t be more happier.,5
0,"*UPDATED* My Versa 2 won't sync notifications (calls, text messages, etc) with my new Samsung Note 20 Ultra 5G. After checking the Fitbit site, the Samsung s20 series is not listed as a compatible device with Fitbit. This is so disappointing. I use my fitbit daily and rely on receiving notifications, especially when my phone is on silent.",2
1,"I previously had the FitBit Charge 2 and love the new Versa 2! I've been wanting an Apple Watch, but didn't want to spend that much. I love that this is waterproof, can control my music, and still get notifications as well as all the other things I loved about my Charge 2. I'm loving the Versa 2!",5
1,Started out great.... all the apps were working ok for a week. Then stopped working and connecting properly. Pretty much just ended up using it as just a step counter and sleep monitor. All the other apps were just junk. Now I feel like I have a duty to let people know that the strap can give you a rash.,3
1,So far it’s been easy to set up and within a couple of days I can operate. It’s not an Apple but I didn’t pay the price of an Apple,5
0,This product at first seemed pretty good even though the feature to get your texts notifications on your phone never worked. However after only 1.5 years it stopped working for no apparent reason and Fitbit was entirely unhelpful in resolving this issue. The manager at fitbit that I spoke with laughed at my concerns. They offered me 35% off any of their new products which is not worth it if the device will break in such a short time. I will be switching to the Apple watch.,1
1,"Not only are the sleep and exercise stats more detailed, but the battery life is far ahead of Apple Watch. Although I am a member of the Appleverse (phone, PC), I could see myself switching back to Android/Windows if those systems were more secure and user-friendly. In fact, Win 10 convinced me to buy my Apple PC.",4
1,"I am liking this a lot so far! I was afraid it was going to be heavy or bulky, but I barely feel it on my wrist. The first vibration startled me, but it’s nice to have the notifications like that. Able to see who is calling, see the weather, any appointments I have. The heart rate tracker is excellent. I was debating the Apple Watch, but this was so much cheaper and it has all the functions I need!",5
1,It was too big to suit me but I could never actually get it to work. The display was too small for me to read without my reading glasses. Returned it.,3
0,"I thought I was upgrading from another fitbit. I really wanted to like this. Needs to be charged every 3 days. Constantly loses synch with my phone. The sleep tracking is hit and miss. Alexa is worthless, I have to re-launch and find the device everytime I try to use it. Sometimes I have to sync 3 or 4 times. Or worse, set up the Alexa every few days. HATE IT! HATE IT! HATE IT!",2
0,Lazer burnt my wrist but it tracks very well. Not going to wear it any more. 😢,1
1,"Not a fan. You have to pay for literally EVERYTHING to use this watch. Want a different watch face? Pay for it. Wanna use Spotify or Pandora? You have to subscribe to them. Wanna do some yoga? You have to pay for that too. I bought this with the impression that since it’s Alexa compatible, that I could control my Amazon Music from it but that is far from the truth. I cannot answer phone calls or return texts (iOS) and it’s extremely annoying for how much I paid for it and how much the FitBit Premium is per month. Basically, if you want to see how many steps you take, your heart rate, and your sleep patterns, then buy thus watch. Otherwise, it’s a waste of money.",5
1,I have been wanting a fitbit for a few years now and hubby got me this one. I love it! I love everything about it. It swipes through the screens smoothly and doesn't bring anything up too slow. I love that I can keep track of my heart rate bc I have high blood pressure. Highly would reccomend,5
1,"I've had this for over a month now and it's everything I wanted. I love that it can pick up exercises without manually inputting it. The app is super easy to use, especially when setting food or weight plans. I ended up buying a few bands to switch up the style once in a blue moon, and the pin system for swapping them is super annoying Other than that I'm really pleased with the performance.",5
1,I wanted a watch that tracks my health and fitness. I wasn’t looking for something to place calls from or really be an extension of my phone. This device is perfect! The design is great. It’s easy to change bands. It has paid well with both android and apple phones.,5
1,"I will no longer charge and I've only had it for 5 months. I contacted customer support. After troubleshooting, I was advised to send it back to them. They provided a shipping label and I have mailed it to them. Now I wait to see how long it takes to fix and come back.",4
0,The Fitbit broke after 6 days. The screen went dark and the battery drained from 100% to dead in two hours. Fitbit is replacing the unit.,1
1,"I was skeptical of the trend, but I love it. Addicting to check stats. I DID get the notorious fit bit rash. I tried all of the tips and tricks, didn't resolve it. I purchased a new band and am now very happy.",5
1,"Half the time my cell rings my watch doesn't. It's not great at giving me texts either. The older model I had no issue with that part, just that the contacts in back broke my skin out.",3
1,"At age 77, I am increasingly aware of the importance of staying active. My Versa 2 is singularly the most important device I have for keeping me motivated. I highly recommend it to everyone, especially to seniors who want to stay healthy and in good shape.",5
1,"This watch meets all my needs, less expensive than Apple Watch and works just as well. Very happy with my purchase.",5
1,I have had several fit bits and this is my favorite one. Totally worth the money. Battery stays up for days. Very accurate in sleep tracking. Love fit bit app.,5
1,I love the Fitbit versa 2. It has a big face that I can read without my glasses and I bought it mainly for the sleep tracking which is very interesting to see my sleep habits.,5
1,"I was very happy to get this price during Amazon days. I am very happy to have a working Fitbit again. I like the purple band plus Rose Gold trim; the face is much easier to read, and I find it more attractive than my former HR.",5
1,Face broke away from the encasement.,3
1,I have been extremely happy with the Versa 2. It has helped with continued weight loss and combined with the app also with helping me get better sleep. The Fitbit community works hard to keep me committed to my fitness regime. I am down 75lbs so far and have gone from 51.5% body fat down to 43.5. The Fitbit premium has also helped me get better sleep. I'm so happy SCAN started me off with the Fitbit inspire.,5
1,"Loved this tracker, so much so that I bought and used a case. I barely wore it in the shower. Sad to say that despite my precautions the side button does not register when I press it. After doing some googling I see that this is a very common issue that often happens between 3-6 months. LAME.",3
1,"I love that this watch is so flexible. From the ease of changing wrist bands to the choices of apps available, I have enjoyed my Versa 2. I don't have to fret over water ruining it when I'm out working and bathing horses. I even bought one for my picky husband who loves it too. It's now an important tool he uses for work.",5
0,"about 1 1/2 months into using the product I got a ""data not cleared, sync and try again"" message on my fitbit screen and I couldn't clear it or use my fitbit watch. The help service was of no service. What an expensive loss.",1
1,"The media could not be loaded.
 The Versa 2 uses the traditional Fitbit home screen which I like. The alarm works as in previous models which is a plus. I am not sure about the battery life or how it will do at the pool. Time will tell.",4
1,"I like this watch very much as with the tap of a finger I can see how many steps I’ve take, my heart rate, stair steps,etc. My only regret is that I don’t know how to use all the many features of it. I need to learn that. I highly recommend it!!!",5
1,"Recently gave my Samsung Gear s3 Frontier away. Was in the market for a tracker/smart watch. Also, looking for something less bulky and light weight. So far I like it. The bands that come with the product are very comfortable. Does a lot less than smart watches, but I didn't use all the features on my previous watch anyway.",5
1,After wearing my Versa 2 for a few weeks this is what I’ve found. My sleep score showed on the app the first 2 days and then it disappeared and have shown it again. It still tracks my sleep cycles and tells me details. I liked the “quick glance” sleep score though. Next the weather app needs to always be synced. I’m not sure why it doesn’t stay logged in. Besides that I haven’t had any issues. Enjoy wearing it.,4
1,"TRIED A LOT OF LOW COST VERSIONS BUT NONE OF THEM GAVE ACCURATE HEART RATES, THIS MATCHES THE MACHINES AT THE GYM AND BY CHEST UNIT. IT WAS BETWEEN THIS AND THE APPLE WATCH. I WENT WITH THIS BECAUSE I DID NOT NEED ALL THE THINGS APPLE DID AND THE BATTERY LIFE IS MUCH BETTER ON THE FIT BIT",4
1,I love the sleep tracking feature. It seems pretty accurate. Sometimes the heart rate jumps drastically down very quickly but overall it’s very handy to have. It does track steps when I am driving when seems weird so I have to take that into consideration.,5
0,I love this tracker when it works but everyone I have owned stops working correctly after 6 months. At the moment 6 months in will not give notifications and altimeter is crazy saying i climbed 20 or 30 stairs when I have not climbed any!,1
1,We have tried almost everything and are not able to get the watch to track the sleep appropriately. It only gives a generic reading. It is very discouraging and disheartening as this was one of the features we wanted.Everything else seems to work just fine.,3
1,"It doesn't give the features that is advertised to have. I went to the web and found out that my watch doesn't have an option. Also, I have set it to vibrate when incoming calls or text come in, but it may have done this one time and then it doesn't do anymore. I have considered returning it.",3
1,"This watch is okay. The sleep monitor and steps I believe not to be very accurate. However the heart monitor generally is on point with my exercise equipment. Likes: phone call/text view, heart monitor, different exercise tracking and battery life. Dislikes: battery charger (broke already), steps counter, those other apps seem useless because watch does have a speaker feature so how or why have Spotify? For the price maybe a smartwatch would have been fine.",3
1,"Great smart watch. Bought this for my 13yo for running. Fits her nicely, loved that she could download music and use Spotify on it. We are returning it only because we are upgrading to the Ionic - turns out she will need the GPS . The screen on fitbits is so much better than the garmins ..",5
0,"It is impossible to get music downloaded on the watch. You cannot download from you phone (apple or android) or tablet. According to the community chat rooms (because there is no support), you should be able to download an app on your laptop, but that is a dead end because the download never goes through. Could be security settings...could be some other compatibility...I'll never know because there is no support. I bought this phone (which is HUGE by the way) so I could listen to music without lugging my phone around. Now I have a tank on my wrist and still need to carry my phone to listen to music.",1
0,"GPS tracking won't work. After 3 months it just poof, went black and the screen isn't working. I'm SO upset.",1
1,I love having all this health data at my fingertips. Every morning I’m so interested in seeing how well it says I slept. I love adding every bit of my food or water and getting buzzed if I haven’t taken 250 steps in an hour. But I especially LOVE having Alexa on my wrist everywhere 24/7.,5
1,"Great fitness tracker. GPS tracking for walks/runs, Alexa compatible, texts and call alerts, you can also sync it to a ton of apps to get reminders from them on the device. I have wore it in the shower multiple times with no problems. The face scratches easily so a screen protector is a must.",5
1,I had a Pebble Time for years since it came out and it was always a little hard to read. The screen and font was too small and lately it was difficult to charge. It was time to replace it. The Versa 2 is a perfect replacement. The screen and font are larger and easy to read and the apps are great.,5
0,I am in pains as I write this . I love this product so much and its features . However it gets faulty easily and does not last . This is the 4th VERSA device I have used between 2018 and now. I had made a similar report earlier so it has become so frustrating . I purchased a Versa 2 in October 2019 which got faulty within 3 months in January 2020. I ordered another one in January 2020 and that one has become faulty as well. I don't know whether the manufacturer is doing anything to improve this at all. I need urgent replacement,1
0,"I'm just one of those people that experiences numbness and tingling pain wearing it. Tried all kinds of things possible and none worked. Hope they come out with a model that doesn't do this because I really like it otherwise, but I'm not pushing through the pain.",1
1,Isn't accurate for distance. Have to reset often to get the watch to recieve notifications. Often the feature that makes the watch vibrate when your cell rings malfunctions. Choose a Garmin .. less errors. ( I bought two and both have the same difficulties).,3
1,"I got this watch when it went on sale. I really like it, it counts my steps, the calories I've burned, and my heart rate just on the normal face. It tracts a lot of other things too. You can connect your phone to it for Alexa and Spotify which is nice. Definitely worth the purchase!",4
1,"I love this activity tracker the Fitbit Versa 2. Does everything I wanted it to and more. Tracks sleep, exercise, steps and heart rate. I have no issues. Love the feel of the product. The band is awesome and I love the clasp. Very happy with my purchase.",5
1,"I am really enjoying my Fitbit Versa 2. I like the integration with other apps, like Strava. It tracks my runs and several of my running and biking friends from around the world also use this app, so it's a great way to connect with them and be encouraged by them.I also like that it integrates with Spotify, which I use on my runs. So far I am really happy with this product and the battery life is amazing! I also like that it has the small and large wrist bands included. I hope you all enjoy this fitness tracker/watch as much as I do.",5
1,"I have been wearing this thing for a few months now. It's sturdy and I love all of the features. My favorite part is probably that I get my texts, calls, and emails on the watch as I am always on the go at work and don't always have my phone handy (I work at an animal shelter so sometimes having your phone in your hand is not an option). Battery life is great. It has definitely motivated me to exercise. Love the Fitbit subscription and workouts.",5
1,"Counts steps, reminds me when to move, logs my exercise and contacts me to several other programs I use. I love it! ♥️",5
0,"Be VERY careful when you buy this. If your phone isn't compatible with the Fitbit app - you will constantly have issues syncing. I must restart my phone EVERY SINGLE DAY to get my Versa 2 to sync with the app. There is nothing Fitbit can or will do about it. If I would have known this, I would never have bought this watch.",1
1,"I wanted to give the Versa 2 a full give stars. But I am having one issue. It isn't highly compatible with my phone. (Samsung Galaxy s10). The Bluetooth connection keeps dropping and according to Google, this is a known issue. That's been quite a bit Frustrating. Other than that, it's been great.",3
1,I enjoy the features of my FITBIT Versa 2. I am glad that I made the purchase. It has been very helpful in tracking my exercises.,5
1,"I love this fit bit versa 2. It gives me all the information I need…steps. Calories, texts, etc. Almost as good as Applewatch but at a more reasonable price!!!",5
1,Has all the features I was looking for. Only thing I don't like is how hard it was to pair with the app and how you need the app to do slot of stuff. I do love the different watch faces you can choose from those are awesome,5
0,I loved versa 2 for about a week. Then it started shutting off. I had to resync it several times a day and it kept getting worse. It would maybe work for 15 minutes then unsync snd shutboff. I talked to Amazon. I talked to Fitbit 3 times. I looked for solutions online. I tried everything. I sent it back today. I’m disappointed and afraid to order another one.,1
0,This product does NOT fit a Versa 2. The Versa has 3 buttons where the Versa 2 has only 1 button. The plastic applicator is designed to fit around the 3 buttons. I still managed to squeeze the applicator on but the edges of the glass protector are not flushed with the screen and it is crooked.,1
1,"Algunas apps me gustaron, otras que son las que más utilizo hay que pagar como spotify, relojs d fondo d pantalla y la música q hay q agregarla desde una computadora, pero me llama la atención q el reloj no trae la marca fitbit en la parte de enfrente, porque los que eh visto si la tienen!!",3
1,"Beautiful color. Watch and mobile app setup was easy and quick. Love the tracking feature options. Smart features such as music is a super bonus, however FYI...you have to subscribe to spotify premium service for that option. I love it!",5
0,"This watch was great, one week after I bought and was actively using this item, the screen went black. Out of the blue. Tried charging it, no use. This was ONE WEEK of use. Never wore it in the shower or anything crazy. Read reviews and noticed others had the same problem. Also, do not try to go through FitBit. They will not help you try to fix your issues. Just do not buy this. Better to go with an apple or Samsung watch, this product was a complete joke.",1
1,"Seems to have trouble syncing. Also I was looking forward to the Alexa application, it either does not work or isn't very good 😕 So far no luck with customer support, again very disappointing, I usually love Fitbit. This has been very disappointing.",3
1,This worked great for the first 1 1/2 months. But then my step count included my arm swing as a step. I could sit and wave my arm around and get steps. Very disappointed.,5
0,"I literally just woke up. I slept in and still feel tired. Well, no wonder - in my sleep I got more than 19000 steps in! Watch does this 5 out of 7 days. I think I'm done with Fitbit.",1
1,"I gave up my Apple Watch for this and I wish it was more compatible with Apple. I cannot respond to messages. That’s the only down, everything else is amazing. Love the Alexa feature. I do wish that was voice activated. I’m happy. There are more I’d love but what it offers is sufficient",4
1,"The Fitbit Versa 2 is a truly amazing smartwatch, as well as a fantastic fitness and health tracker. As a longtime Fitbit user (first the Alta, then the Ionic, and now the Versa 2), I find the Versa 2 to be the best of the best!!!",5
1,"Love the Versa. If you buy the extended warranty, be aware that it only covers things like cracked screens, not if the device stops functioning. That is only covered by the manufacturer’s warranty.",5
1,"I really love my Fitbit the only issues I really noticed were connecting the Bluetooth and some of the services like Spotify and Pandora. I did get it figured out and there's been no issues since. The battery life is really good I think I've worn mine for like 3 days or so before I charged it. The app, not so much. I have had to uninstall and reinstall it, force stop it, things like that.",5
1,"So, i was really torn between the apple watch and the fitbit. I am wishing I got the former.The pros sedentary reminders, water reminders, meditation and mindfulness . The cons The sleep tracking is average, i cant receive calls, just the notifications. I think this is more of a exercise tracker than a smartwatch. Their app store is very limited.",3
0,I can not see most of my info because the watch does not sync. It fits well and love the color but can not access any apps! Impossible to change wallpaper because the page also never loads.,1
1,"Found out after purchasing that it needs to connect to wifi for all the features to work. It also can not accept special characters in the wifi password. So you either have to live with only bluetooth connectivity and no music, or dumb down the security on your wifi. Personally, I will not compromise my digital security for Fitbit's inability to design their software.",3
1,"This is not accurate when tracking HITT workouts. If that is your goal, get a chest strap. The steps count is pretty much accurate and so is the sleep tracking feature. The watch itself looks and feels pretty great. Battery is decent and I love the more secure feel when charging compared to the fitibit Ionic.",4
0,"Overall disappointed with this watch. Got it at the discounted Christmas price ($130) and I wouldn’t buy it again at that price. The cheap rubber band broke completely off in less than 1 week, and there isn’t really anything special that makes this watch comparable in price to an Apple Watch.",2
0,out of the box and in the return bin at UPS in less than an hour. i had trouble connecting the fitbit to my iphone during setup and after initial installation. definitely not a good sign. wasn’t even able to play around with the features because of the connection issues. i have an iphone 11.,2
0,"Very disappointed with the Versa 2 thus far. Purchased in Oct. and it was fine for a couple of months, but then started acting up shortly after an update. Now is very glitchy, the screen will not respond consistently and wrist movement works only about every other time to turn on display. I tried factory reset and changing clock face like the website suggested but it hasn’t made any difference. Very disappointing because I loved the Blaze and had one for several years with no problem. I’ve been waiting for an update to resolve the issue but doesn’t look like there will be one.",1
1,"I really like the Versa 2. It does a great job at tracking exercise and sleep. It's a great motivator because it celebrates when you reach the fitness goals you've established. The heart rate monitor seems to be very accurate. It has a good battery life. There are many helpful apps to use on your phone include fitness, music, meditation and u can even use it to pay for the occasional Starbucks! I didn't like that the band was initially irritating and have me a rash, but I was told to keep it dry and use alcohol to wash it, and there have been no more problems.",4
1,"I’ve had this watch for about 4 months now, really haven’t had any problems. I really love it actually! Just two things though- my battery does NOT last longer than 2 days if I wear it the whole time, or even if I take it off during the night. Second, I cannot get it to sync with my paid Spotify account. Kinda disappointed with those two, but it’s a really good smart watch otherwise!!",5
0,"I have not liked it, im always to re sync it everyday, its getting tiresome, if I could I would get my money back! I have watched every review on trouble shooting, I was just sent a bad product!!!",1
0,It was a decent watch for the year and a half that I had it. I bought it as an affordable replacement for my Apple Watch so it lacked in some key features like “find my phone” as well as consistently having to run the Fitbit app in the background of my phone to be able to do anything through the watch. This week it started acting glitchy and would go from 50% battery to dead. Now it won’t even turn on. Very disappointed in the longevity of its use!,1
1,Scrolling doesn't work 2nd one is really good in problem charge last 6 days scrolling good on this one/original wrist band broke my wrist out got a different band works good they should work on band different material,4
1,"I love that this more affordable than a Apple watch and much greater battery life which is a huge plus for me, less things to charge each day.I use the alarm, time count up and countdown a bit. I like it tracks my heartrate, sleep habits, etc.",5
0,DO NOT BUY THIS WATCH!!! I bought this back in February and have only gotten use it for a month 🤬 the touch stopped working and it took them a month to send me a replacement and now the replacement is acting up and keeps restarting over and over until it kills the battery. Literally the worse fitness watch ever. I had a $20 watch that worked better than this. Stick to an apples watch or anything not Fitbit. So fed up,1
0,"This is good as a clock and pedometer. Beyond that it’s useless as an exercise tracker because when I go into it’s tracking function it freezes up. I’ve complained to Fitbit customer support and their response is, it’s a known defect and they’re working on it. Amazon won’t refund because it’s outside the 30 return period. $$$ flushed.",1
0,"It doesn’t track your miles when riding a bike. It will only tell you your heart rate and time riding but not your distance traveled. It’s a bummer when you’re trying to do weekly challenges through the Fitbit app with your friends, your workouts aren’t recorded in your daily totals.",2
0,Only a few of the features work. Won't track sleep. Worked a few times when I first got it. Hasn't worked in a week now. Doesn't sync with app. uninstalled and reinstalled app but still doesn't work. Now it is past the return window by a few days.,2
1,"Absolutely love the look and feel of the Versa 2.HOWEVER.... Beware of the firmware update! After 2 days owning it, my Versa 2 tried to perform a ""routine"" update... It ""finished"" updating and went black... I have not had time to try to fix it yet.",3
1,This was a gift for a friend she loved it and I love mine. So easy to use even for me and I'm a boomer.,5
1,Works as described except the battery only lasts about two days without the need to be recharged. Noticed the other evening her watch stayed on much longer than mine and thought this might be the cause. If manufacturer can tell us how to fix we will do it. Mine works totally as advertised.,3
1,"So the first time I went to take a call with my versa2, well, headphones may have worked. Boy I showed my age trying to hear the other person on my Fitbit 😂 either a not so blonde but blonde moment or just a (medical ✌️) stoner moment. So 40 and up. Read the print you can't see (cuz ur eyes are getting bad) so if course, they apply to us. Get some Bluetooth headphones.",4
1,The watch is easy to use. I like how long it stays charged. The mobile app however isn’t the easiest to navigate. It’s not very user friendly. I also had a problem syncing the watch with the app. One day it just wouldn’t synch. After trying several things it finally synched. Luckily it only happened once.,5
0,First one wouldn't sync so sent it back. Second one synced but the steps counter was off and sometimes it would go up by 50 instead of 1.,1
1,Disappointed that it doesn’t automatically sync with my phone. I have to constantly manually sync it with my phone.,4
0,First of all you need phone running Android 8 to sync to phone. Would not keep accurate time unless you keep syncing. The Wi-Fi would not stay connected more than couple of minutes. I reset it to factory settings then it would not work again. It would setup but nothing on screen but Fitbit white logo. Rebooted and wants to setup again. Did this over and over for about 2 hours. Gave up. Since Google bought the company the quality has gone down. My older Fitbit works great. I am switching to Garmin.,2
1,"I love Fitbit and sleep tracking. There is nothing wrong with the basics of this device and I really like the vibration alarm and that it’s water resistant. I use the stop watch for my job, but other than that I could have stuck with a more basic model. Most of the extra features are annoying to use.",3
1,"The sleep tracker does not report results on the watch, but rather only through the app on your phone because the feature does not sync. An hour spent with customer service did not resolve the problem and the rep reported that the tech team is aware of and has been working on the problem since the product was introduced p, which was months ago. So they are falsely advertising this feature and know it. And If you intend to use the watch to access Pandora, another advertised feature, be aware that you can only access the subscription Pandora and not the free version. The device works well in other respects but if these features are important be aware.",3
0,"Isn't accurate, regardless of clock face used and everybody's jumping ship check the Google Play store..... Ratings are tanking like crazy with no resolution and each update makes it worse do not count on this for an accurate step or sleep tracker. Now owned by Google.",1
1,"I have used Fitbit since 2015 and still have confidence in this product. The added features on the Versa 2 are great, highly recommend.",5
1,Great smart watch... Best I've had since my long missed Pebble Time. I went from a Blaze to this one... huge jump in technology... But I worry that this Versa 2 won't be supported once the Google acquisition is completed... I know the fitbit acquisition of Pebble shorten the usable life of my Pebble Time...,4
1,I got this for tracking work outs. I bought January 2020. Today April 2021 the battery is down to lasting one day. Disappointed. thought it should of lasted longer than 15 months.,3
0,My husband bought my Versa 2 for my birthday in May. I have spent the last 3 months trying to keep it connected to my phone in order to track my fitness journey. It will not stay connected to my phone no matter what I do. Not what I expected from a Fitbit product. Now all I can use it for is a watch and calendar.,2
1,"The media could not be loaded.
 I didn’t like that don’t test BP and O2 level.I like that does Sleep, steps and calories burned",5
1,Love this watch! It does so much but is still very simple to use. The battery life is very long mine usually last 3-4 days. I like how easy it is to navigate I've had 2 other smart watches and the versa 2 beats them in every way shape or form. BUY IT!! YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!!!,5
1,"I saved my tips to buy this watch, upgrading from a Samsung Watch knockoff.What I loved:-Full color display-Drop down notification menu-Band style (that specialty one was amazing!)-Built in AlexaWhat forced me to return it:-Tiny wristsI have very slender wrists, and the watch part was bulky enough that it was uncomfortable to wear long-term.Other than that one detail, I loved it!",4
1,Loving my Versa2. Battery life is very good and tracking has been a breeze. I thought it was odd though that depending on the color of the original band it cost more. I didn't care which color it came with as I change out my bands out anyway. Just something to keep in. mind to save some dollars.,5
0,The watch was good for the 3 months it lasted. Never showered or swam with it. Just did regular workouts and wore it thru the day and night. Then one day the screen stopped working. It's super bright and non responsive to the touch.Absolutely disappointed.,1
0,"The watch has had problem after problem. Customer service has been less than helpful and has offered me no solution. I bought this watch in June and within a month it wasn’t working right, was told to factory reset it, lost all of my apps, only for it to work for a month and mess up again. The latest problem is the heart rate doesn’t work. So done with this watch.",1
1,This is my favorite thing right now. It's very esteically appealing and does what it's supposed to do. Basic watch functions along with all the smart features. Really love this fit bit.,5
1,"I felt like this was definitely worth the price. It had fast shipping, came with a charger and an additional size for a band, and the app works perfectly! As long as you keep your Bluetooth on, on your phone and keep the app synced it works way we'll!",4
0,"Don’t buy this watch, you will waste your money! I got my watch on a May 7th and it stop holding a charge on June 3rd. Sent the watch back and received a new one the next day. The second watch would not charge fully and I could not get it to sync with the app. I did like the watch and the app but it has some serious problems!!!",1
1,All works well with the watch and read out and activity tracker but the Alexa integration doesn’t work consistently making the timer a less useful tool.,4
0,"The media could not be loaded.
 No entiendo que le pasa a mi fitbit, recién lo compre, baje la app, lo sincronice, se conecto al wifi, tiene batería, etc. Y la pantalla de mi fitbit no aparece nada, ni se mueve, no puedo tocarlo, simplemente esta negro con el logo del fitbit y ahí se ha quedado.",1
0,I only had this watch for a 1 1/2 year and now it’s glitching and I’m trying to do a soft restart and getting nothing. Is there a policy where I can get another one to replace this one?,1
0,"Most of the music apps need a subscription, to use the app that make these watch worth buying. It's a glorified watch. Everything this watch said to make convenient, It doesn't. Definitely, will never buy any Fitbit products from now on. Do your research. My phone does everything for free... Waste of money. 🗑️🗑️🗑️",2
1,"I ordered the Versa 2 about a month ago after my Blaze finally bit the dust. So far, I love it. The battery life is really long and I really like all the screen options. I bought the special edition but have not tried the Amazon Alexa or on screen workouts.",5
1,Generally happy with it but bracelet broke after only six weeks. It is a light watch making it comfortable to wear at night.Connectivity to Alexa is somewhat unreliable as it fails to work most of the time. I have been unable to download music to it so far since documentation is poor or non-existent.,3
0,"I was absolutely loving this watch, I've been using fitbit for years and got the Versa because I wanted to start swimming. Never got around to swimming but after about 6 months of use, my fitbit no longer responds to touching the screen. I searched through the forums and this has been a problem for many users. Super disappointed.",2
0,"It's easy to use, and most of the functions work well. However, if your wrist sweats even a little bit, the accuracy of the HR monitor goes out the window, meaning any workout you do will be way off for HR records and calorie count, which is kind of the only reason I got a watch. So bad for active people, but cheap and usable, would recommend for kids or people who aren't very active.",2
0,I loved it the first week. Now it's just disappointing. It won't stay connected to my Bluetooth. It won't show me my notifications. It's a glorified watch. I have done the updates. I have reset. I have done problem solving. Nothing works. Now it won't even reset it's stuck in loading. Buyer beware.,1
1,I absolutely love this watch. I wanted something similar to the iPhone smart watch and this does it! I dont get every option as the other but it's still great. Battery life is wonderful. Would definitely recommend,5
1,"I have had my Fitbit now coming up 7 months.I love it! It alerts me when I gave a call or text message coming in. My steps are counted, my sleep is monitored! That is the best part!Highly recommend this product!!!",5
1,I love this Fitbit versa two. It does everything I was looking for and it’s easy to use easy to change the watch band out for something else that I bought online. Just absolutely love this watch,5
1,"I really like this Fitbit! It’s very sleek, allows you to download your music to it and paired with my AirPods. So far, the only negative is the sleep tracker doesn’t work well. It only tracked my sleep for 2 hours, when in reality I actually slept 6 hours.",4
0,"Microphone died already, Spent hours online with support, was told to expect an email, never happened. NOT HAPPY, 3 MONTHS FOR A $200 WATCH TO DIE? REALLY?",1
1,"I've had my Versa 2 for about 6 months now. I've slept, mowed, swam, ran, walked, etc in it and I find it extremely accurate. The battery lasts so long! I also love getting all of my notifications on my watch, when I can't be near my phone.",5
1,"Neither of the two fitbits I have owned ever connected to the WiFi, so I could never update. Undercounts steps, doesn’t register heart rate throughout exercise like I need it to. That said, if these ever outlive their upsettingly low lifespan of barely over a year, it’s a wonderful tool for the price.",4
1,"I live by this watch—wear it all the time except when I charge it! It allows me to track all activities I want and is much easier to use than its competitors. Its “rewards” help me to improve my fitness and are fun and gratifying. I really, really love it.",5
1,"The bad reviews on this on every site possible made me look at Samsung smart watches, but those reviews weren't much better and I wasn't a fan of the round watches. So I gave in to the Fitbit. There was a learning curve, but I blame myself for not being tech savvy. The text messaging works, spotify works, it's sleek and looks great, it's lightweight and comfortable.",5
1,"The watch works as anticipated and I enjoy having the data it provides. The band, however has caused a rash on my arm and I've had to order a replacement. When I contacted Fitbit, their advice was, ""stop wearing it for a while.""I ordered a replacement band on Amazon and it is fine now. Love the watch. Hate the band...",4
1,"I wanted a device that would track my steps, my heart rate, my sleep patterns, and my workouts. This does it all and it’s so easy to use! Being able to see texts is a bonus but wasn’t a must-have for me. All-in-all the Versa 2 is a great fitness tracker and well worth the money for me. I’m not hardcore into exercise (no marathons for me!) but I do run a few miles a few days a week, as well as hiking, riding a stationary bike, and doing barre workouts. Someone who’s a more dedicated fitness enthusiast may want to invest in a different device, but this is perfect for me and I’m obsessed with it!",5
1,"My Fitbit Versa 2 will Not sync to my Android phone anymore. I have tried everything from powering off my Fitbit Versa 2, to rebooting My phone, trying new email addresses and nothing works. I used to really love My Fitbit Versa 2, But it's only 18 months old and it doesn't work anymore 😭😭💔💔",5
1,"It took me a while to get the watch synced with my phone, but make sure you go into phone settings and what you allow the app to access and make sure you have everything selected. Otherwise, I really love this watch so far! I can get notifications for all the apps from my home on my watch AND voice respond to them. Step tracker and sleep tracker seem pretty accurate! Can access amazon to turn on and off my living room lights. Battery seems pretty decent, about a 3 day life for me I think! Overall, I'm super happy with this purchase!",4
0,Just got this 11 months ago and it died after tracking a swim. Fitbit customer service is going to replace it for me. Worked great before that though.,2
1,It's a great watch! Does a good job of keeping track of my stats. Some of the apps are useful. The only problem I had with the watch is that it was kind of tricky to set up. I had to call tech support to get a go of it.,4
1,Very nice product. Has plenty of options and setting to track everything you would need. Battery life is really good.,5
0,Literally off by a mile. Step count not even close . Got it for steps and hart rate but step count is so far off its not Evan useful. Battery life only 3 days. First and last Fitbit I’ll ever buy. 2 stars because it does keep time.Edit 1 year later still not impressed got Apple Watch yesterday already like it better in every way. Fitbit will become my beater watch if it breaks won’t miss it.,2
1,I absolutely love my Versa. I had the flex before this but wanted a smart watch. I was debating the versa or Apple Watch. I just love the Fitbit app and all it has to offer and it cost less then the Apple Watch. I am so glad I decided to upgrade to the fit bit versa.,5
0,"My spouse has had various fitbit devices over the years and highly recommended I get one. I was severely disappointed when the watch completely stopped working after only four months of use when I went swimming with it for the first time. Prior to that it struggled to accurately read my heart rate unless I had the band very tight against my wrist, which after a couple weeks caused serious irritation and I had to buy a new cloth band for it.",2
0,"Doesn't always record number of steps taken, and the reading of heartbeat is not accurate at all. I guess it can be used as a guideline, but the only thing that seems to be accurate is the time. I feel like I've been duped.",2
1,My girlfriend uses her fitbit to track workouts and track the amount of steps. The biggest issue is the battery does not last after a year. This is my girlfriends third versa product and we have noticed that it stops charging after about a year. If they fixed that issue this product would be amazing.,3
0,"this is the second versa i bought and both were defective. both froze on the set up wallet screen and i tryed everything to fix it but no luck,am returning it and not buying another, pure crap",1
1,Its ok but it could have been better made like solar energy for charging battery it sucks to have to charge it every 3 days,3
1,"I love this Fitbit. I have had a Charger and the Versa, but this one is better than them both. I like that my notifications show and I can connect with Alexa to set timers, track packages, etc. It has more options for the face too.",5
0,after only two months this Fitbit will not hold a charge and when I do get it fully charged the main display screen is completely black - no longer displays the date/time - main screen settings. I've been buying Fitbits for years and the last two that I've purchased for myself + 2 that I have purchased as gifts have malfunctioned or stopped working within the year or a year and a half of buying them. Very disappointing. Maybe changing to be an Apple watcher wearer!,1
0,"Awful device. It kept randomly shutting off and wouldn’t turn on unless I charged it, then it would do it again only 10 minutes later. I owned it for 1 day and returned it. Getting a replacement so I will update if it’s any better but I’m not too hopeful",1
0,My first Fit Bit lasted two days. I did a factory reset and it started scrolling. Still scrolling and still scrolling when I sent it back to Amazon. Ask for a replacement and it was already scrolling when I opened the new box. I did check with Fit Bit and they wanted me to send it to them. I sent it to Amazon instead. Disappointed.,1
0,"I bought this for my dad's birthday. I have always had an apple watch, but he has a Samsung phone so I needed something compatible. The fitbit was very confusing and difficult to set up. Functionality and overall usability is significantly worse that the apple watch. Returned within the first week.",2
1,Not what I expected. The battery doesn’t stay charged very long. The instructions on how to use and set up the watch are confusing and inaccurate.This is my second watch the first one I had to send back because it just stopped working altogether.,3
1,I love this new Fitbit. At first I was having trouble keeping it connected to where I can receive notifications. After I updated it has worked fine. Would like to be able to respond to text with it but as of now you can’t. Also I work as a nurse. When you and pushing things and your arm isn’t moving your steps are not being counted. That is true with any Fitbit. Wish there was a way that could be fixed. My old one I would wear in my ankle while at work.,5
1,"Its a really good watch, though I wish they disclosed it contains nickel before I purchased it and noticed the disclosure on the box when I received it.",4
1,"Love my fitbit versa 2! Unfortunately it's not 5 days to recharge. It's usually 2 to 3 days. It also has a slight vibration to remind you how many steps you still need on the hour.Its also cool that not only can I change the clock face, but also personalize it with my on pic from my photo album.",5
1,"Overall I like the tracker, but as a heart rate monitor, it is terrible. Consistently significantly off from my chest band monitor, making the tracking in the app all the more frustrating because you know the stats are off. I have tried all the suggested tricks of different positions on my arm, and it is still off. Will be going with a different brand when this one kicks it.",5
0,"I’ve had 3 of these Versa 2 watches, and they’ve all just stopped working after about a year of use. One of them stopped charging, the other the touch screen stopped working, and this third one just stopped detecting my heart rate. Customer service doesn’t help, and they only offer a meager discount to replace their faulty products. Terrible terrible product - would not recommend if you’re looking for a quality, long-term use watch.",1
0,"Just received my watch last night around 6pm. Put it on and at first it seemed to work. I noticed that it wasn’t tracking my steps correctly and did not track my sleep correctly. When I receive notifications from texts messages, the message didn’t look exactly the same as it did on my phone. I originally wanted an Apple Watch but didn’t want to spend extra money. I will be returning this product as when I woke up it already said I had over 600 steps which is impossible as I was asleep! I like the plum color and all, but I am returning it the very next day as I still want to be able to use it without my phone and be able to reply back to messages.",1
0,After a little over 2 years this watch has died. Won’t charge. Won’t turn back on. I’ve tried everything and the best Fitbit will do is give me a slight discount on a new one. I’ve taken good care of my Versa 2 there is no reason it should work one day and the next not even turn on. I have always bought Fitbit. Not anymore. Customer service just thanked me for my feedback and moved on. 👎🏻 Would not recommend.,1
1,"I use my new Fitbit Versa 2 to track my steps, my sleep, my food and water, and to remind me to move more often. I like how it tracks the calories in the food and suggests more or less.I love all the different faces and features. I love having only one button and the charging is so much easier than the Blaze.",5
1,"Amazing smart watch/ fitness tracker! Well worth the upgrade from my old fitbit. The charging, the sleep tracking, calorie tracking, weather, etc. Is all great. The voice reply to texts works really well and pretty accurate! Definitely recommend.",5
1,"Love this ""watch""! I think it's very accurate although it may have cheated me out of 4000 steps today pushing a wheelchair. Or maybe it wasn't tight enough. So many features- text, weather, Alexa, any variety of exercise. Love the rose gold/petal color. Highly recommend!",5
0,"I've had two Versa 2 Fitbits and neither lasted more than a year. The first one they did replace when it malfunctioned at the year mark, but the 2nd one stopped working after about 9 months and I was out of luck. There is something clearly wrong with this product and not durable. Save your money and look at other options.",1
0,"The stupid thing died after 3 months, wouldn't even reset and wouldn't charge. I would expect this from some of the cheaper alternatives, but this watch is WAY too expensive to only last a few months. Don't waste your money.",1
1,"I love the sleep tracking, the greatly improved battery life, and the overall appearance of the watch. Alexa built in and ease of setup are nice features.",5
0,"At first I thought that I made a great purchase and saved money. But now the device is dead and will not turn back on after seven months. I did not get it wet or damage it at all, I take great care of everything I own and cannot believe that this Versa 2 is dead! Not happy at all.",2
1,"Only thing that we changed was the band, which is just personal preference. Love the style, square face, and large face that you are able to read & see everything on watch with no problem. Excellent Features, definitely a GREAT BUY!",5
1,I had the alta HR and wanted an upgrade. I'm amazed at all this can do. I love the option to change the screen. I thought it would look to big on my small wrist but I think it looks great. I highly recommend.,5
1,"I have had Fitbit watches for years, and this Versa 2 is by far my favorite. I have been very satisfied with all my Fitbit watches, but I love all the little extras on the Versa 2.",5
1,"I upgrade from the Blaze and I'm so happy I did. Love the access to all my information on the watch rather than having to go into the app. Love that I can see the weather on it and load my own picture for the watch face. I don't use all the tools (mobile wallet, voice activation, etc..) but they're there if I want to some day. Really happy with this purchase.",5
1,"I really love all of the features of the Versa 2 - water resistant, improved sleep monitoring, having access to Pandora! Had a problem doing the initial update, and took a couple calls to figure out how to connect to wifi, but Fitbit ultimately came through. A great Christmas gift.",4
0,"For 175$ you get a rubber band that makes your wrist break out, the requirement to spend hours managing the app, which never synchs with your phone, the need to load twitter to get app support and the need to use a laptop to get the music on your versa, which also never synchs with the laptop. this is not a fitness device it is a advanced course in consumer applications. I kept trying so much that I missed my window to return it. I was healing from the rash!!! JUNK JUNK JUNK",1
0,I bought this Fitbit on April 27 and have worn it to the pool about six times for approximately 30 minutes each time. It quit working today and my return date has passed to return it back to Amazon!!,2
1,I have had my Fitbit for about 2 months. I really like and have had zero complaints up until this past week. The Fitbit disconnects from my iPhone Bluetooth regularly and sometimes will not reconnect. I can’t quite figure why this is or why sometimes it syncs the first time and sometimes it doesn’t. I expect inaccuracy with any tracking device so I’m not bothered by that. UPDATE: I have now had my FitBit for 6 months and after installing the update to the Fitbit I no longer experienced issues of disconnecting. I enjoy the sleep tracker and the exercise feature. I would buy this again and recommend to anyone.,4
1,"Bought as a gift replacement for an aging Fitbit. It works great, interfaced beautifully, and is comfortable. Accurate sleep tracking. Liked the new features, as well.",5
1,"Does an adequate job of tracking steps (sometimes adds more if you’re driving over a bumpy road) and I like the reminder that I need more steps if I’ve been sed notary for a while. The heart rate monitor seems to be pretty accurate on me. I also like the notification of an incoming text on my iPhone. Two thumbs down though for the sleep tracking. I’ve only gotten three sleep scores in 2 weeks. Aargh. Overall, I like itand would recommend a Versa 2.",4
1,I like my Versa2 watch particularly for counting g my steps and calories. I normally charge it like every five to six days or so. I also record my sleep but not often as I don't really like sleeping with the watch on my wrist. A truly good buy that I recommend to everyone.,5
1,"I have had several ""smart"" watches. Most have been the galaxy watches and a few fitbit when they first came out. This one is by far my favorite! I dont sleep in watches so I cannot speak on that, but all the other function work perfectly!",5
1,"Got this Fitbit for my girlfriend and she loves it! The only thing she doesn't like about it is the battery life. Also, the Spotify app doesn't work",5
0,"I'm so tired of trying to sync this device. If you are about to buy it, PLEASE DON'T DO IT!.. save your money and time!.... I never complain about what I buy, but THIS IS THE WORST THING EVER!. First, it doesn't sync so my date and time are inaccurate. Second, because it doesn't sync I can't keep track of my sleep which is one of the main features why I bought it. Third, the data you save is lost right away because you don't have access to the app data if your Fitbit doesn't sync. Make yourself a favor and invest your money in something that is worth it.",1
1,Great device. 2 things that could improve the device1. It has onboard storage for music but you can't install it from the app you need to connect it to a computer that should be fixed with an app update.2. There is a premium version of that app the gives you more information on the vitals the watch monitors. That shouldn't be the case when you already just made a 200 dollar investment in a device that you bought expressly to tell you information about your vitals.But it overall works as advertised.,4
1,I really like this watch because it has everything installed in it that I can use. Looks pretty and does what it is suppose to do in the functions described. I purchased other watch bands to dress it up a little,5
1,"This design is much more functional than my previous Fitbit (Ulta HR). While I notice it doesn't pick up all my steps when my wrist is rigid it's still within the range of previous designs +/- 10%. The sleep tracker is awesome! When I had bouts of snoring/apnea it correlated with my CPAP readings. It's also a great indicator of breathing issues when using different pillows. I've found a new pillow that has kept my range low and steady, almost looks like a flatline.",5
1,"Still have to restart after updates etc. Battery life is much better than my ionic. Love the microphone so I can reply to my text messages without my phone, Update: For some reason, it slips in and out of microphone being available to use to reply. I got a new apple phone and it hasn’t worked for weeks",4
0,"I preorder. Wish I had not. Think I got a lemon. Can not get notifications , for any thing. Can not get music app to work. I call the company. The tell me my samson note 10 is out of date and will not support my fitbit it's good for telling time.",1
1,Had an Inspire for a couple years. Couldn’t see the screen outside in the sunlight.This Versa has a great screen and more features!,5
0,"It didn't pair at first. Then when I was laying in bed it said I walked. It also calculated a HR when it wasn't on my wrist. And like most smartwatches, it won't work if you have a tattoo.",2
1,I love it! The only thing is I wish it took my blood pressure. But it’s a great bang for your buck.,5
1,"Love it! It’s not too bulky, it’s comfortable to wear and sleep in. I love that the bands are interchangeable and I like that it comes with so many app integrations.",5
0,The button on the left which does everything on the watch died a year and 4 months in. Didn’t last. Neither did my last Fitbit.,1
1,"Do you want to lose weight? I recomend four things. This watch, a sauna top, a tight workout schedule and a better diet. Viola!",5
1,Just got it! It's pretty and accurate and easy to see on the screen! I had problems seeing the charge 4 when walking outside!! Much easier to read!!,5
1,The heart rate reading is off significantly during workouts. I've tried both wrists and repositioned but still during HIIT workout it says my heart beat is low but I can check manually it's almost double what the watch says,3
1,Exceeded my expectation,4
1,"I've had my Fitbit for about a couple months now. I really like it! The calorie tracking seems a little off as it shows I burn 2000+ calories a day, which I don't. 😂 Still trying to find a way to reconfigure that. Battery life is good, it's very lightweight, very durable, and stylish.",5
0,My watch only last about 4 months and then quit on me. It was a waste of money down the drain and I’m no long going to be having Fitbit watches. So not a happy customer.,1
1,"Really happy with the Versa 2! My biggest gripe with the Versa 1 was the short battery life. It was good for only about 2 days. The Versa 2 is good for about 5 days. Much better! I’d like to see FitBit up it to 30 days, but this is definitely a move in the right direction.",5
1,"I love this Fitbit watch, very stylish, amazing battery life and I love that I can get the messages from my phone to my watch. I love the hourly step reminder too.",5
1,"This Fitness Tracker is awesome and has helped keep tabs on me and has already helped me to start losing weight. It's made of great quality items and materials. It's battery lasts about 5 days if on low brightness. Tracking weight, water, food, sleep, steps, and calories burned has never been easier for me. I'm very happy with my purchase. The Rose Gold and Pink straps are stylish and very pretty to look at. It looks awesome with most outfits and styles. Good functionality and fashion. I would 100% recommend to family and friends.",5
0,This worked for the first few days and now all of a sudden it’s completely messed up and I can’t fix it,1
1,"I just received the Versa2 for a Christmas gift. I would have gave 5 star rating,but it is to new to do so.",4
1,"Great watch. Wish like heck it came with some kind of screen protector. Scratches at the least little bump. For. Watch, seems a little dumb to not have a better protectant screen for this price.",5
1,"I was a little worried reading the reviews on this say it was a mess to set up, but it was SO easy to set up. Took about 3-5 minutes. It's my first day using the watch, so I will update, but everything is user friendly and visually appealing. The band is soft and comfy.",5
1,I have no complaints. This thing absolutely rules.Turning off tracking at the end of a long walk/run is hard to remember... that's it,5
1,This Fitbit measures my sleep and gives me a sleep score. It also gives me a heartbeat rate.,5
0,"I’ve had problems with the watch since day one and wish I would have returned my Fitbit. It’s had trouble syncing to the app, turning on and not responding, wildly inaccurate heart rate and failing to charge on the provided charger. Super glitchy and now I’ve come to realize that the return policy is very short on this product. Wish I had just purchased an Apple product. Also, buy anything from Costco and they’ll step in and accept a return when a terrible manufacturer won’t.",2
1,"I am a huge fan of Fitbit, and I have loved this watch. I love how it looks. The battery power is amazing. I always look forward to the updates because they always bring the best improvements. I am an Apple person, but I’d rather spend less money on a Fitbit because I love the quality of their products so much.",5
1,"It looks big on my girlfriend's wrist, however she loves it, and just about every day she learns something new, was a great birthday gift..",5
1,"Love the watch but hate how hard it is to change band. On the blaze, I could buy a frame and connect the band to it whenever I wanted to change my band. Can't with this one and so far every band I have ordered with frame doesn't fit. Much happier with the Blaze.",3
0,"The reasons I bought this watch; Alexa, Spotify, not having my phone on me while working out. The reasons that this was a huge waste of money; Alexa connection is ALWAYS lost continually having to sync Fitbit app to make it work, Spotify does not work with free subscription, you must purchase a premium subscription, lastly the volume controls do not work with wireless earbuds so I must control volume with my phone, so I must have my phone with me during workouts. Watch looks nice though, insert eye roll here.",2
1,Why did I wait so long to get a Fitbit. This is helping me reach my fitness goals. My favorite feature is the reminder to complete steps on the hour. The motivations along the way are nice too.,5
1,"The Versa 2 is similar to the older Surge, only easier to use, charge and navigate, and colorful. It has decent battery life: I use it for keeping track of my steps whether I'm on the treadmill, cycling (activity) or tennis. I also keep track of my resting heart rate , and this Versa evaluates my sleep in addition to overall sleep time, thanks to the Fitbit App.",5
1,"Mobile app and sleep tracking are very good. Smart features that I get negged me on to achieve more. Earlier I awash tracking 10,000 steps (and average of 9,000) & during Pandemic my average came down to 6,000. The suggestion to walk 250 steps per hour helped me to cross 10,000 steps a couple of days back after a streak of 49 days.",5
0,"This is the WORST purchase I’ve ever made!!! I regret it so much!! Useless lightweight and doesn’t even connect! When it finally does connect to the app the wifi won’t stay connected and forget about receiving notifications on the watch from anything.... very disappointing honestly! I even disconnected it several times, watched tons of video and read the instructions and I still can’t get my notifications to display on the watch! I wasted 4 hours and I’m done. It’s definitely not worth it and I’m sending mine back.",1
1,"Fitbit Versa has changed my Life♥️I track my steps, reminds me to move on the hour, tracks my sleep and how I slept and also keeps a count on water intake. Anything to help me motivate and keep a hold on my health. I recommend this to anyone who is ready to start being active.",5
1,"I haven’t evaluated the entire watch, but the band if it gets wet or I sweat it makes my wrist turn red and itchy. I guarantee the band is latex, hopefully I can find alternate bands.",4
0,The whole purpose of this is to track activity. My granddaughter had hers fall off when swinging a bat and now the face is broke. It has a one year warranty - but there's no way to contact the seller or find help in returning or repairing it.,1
1,The watch is great! It's a bit strange that it only has max limit of 8 alarms as I need way more for work. Going to see how it works when I try it at work. At least it has timer so I might try that instead. Sleep tracker is great to see! Design is quite sleek and luxurious.,4
0,Loved it until the screen went out two months after the one year warranty. This happened with my last Fitbit too but decided to give them another try. Just hard to stomach spending almost two hundred dollars every year to track my activity. Looking at other brands now for my replacement.,1
1,I was getting facebook.and voxer messages now just texts. Sometimes syncing is leggy and I wish the apps available stated you had to pay or that they only work on devices you don't have. But I love the fit bit and how this one is just like a watch.,4
1,It's on point to do what I expected im tracking my steps and to tell me I need to move. No sitting all day.,5
1,"I've had Fitbit for many years, the last one lasted over 3 years. This is perfect at a great price.",5
1,Looks great - Fitbit app is awesome - so easy to use & keeps all the key info you want for fitness.Log all my workouts - plus last 6-7 days per charge - this is really that good- its a great deal - get it.Bought one for whole family - its really good.,5
1,Wish the band was better. Ended up buying a stainless steel link band to replace the original band. The watch is much better than the old ASUS watch it replaced. Battery life is fantastic. Feature rich and easy to understand how to use the features. Like the Google app on my Samsung.,5
1,"Amazing sleep tracking and great step and heart rate accuracy!!! I’ve come from Garmin devices and Fitbit seems to be more accurate and the app is wayyyyy better!! Paired with a Spigen case, I never take it off and it’s very comfortable!",5
1,"Very odd - LOVE the watch but the bands they give you that are extra - don't fit. None of them are able to be squeezed into the watch. Very disappointed as now I am stuck with a very small, tight band to wear.",3
1,"Prime Day deal! The sleep tracker, the text phone and text alerts (includes text message, step counter, heart rate and Star Bucks card link! Awesome so far. Long battery life. Lots of other features I’ve yet to explore, music link to phone, Spotify,weather, alarm, Alexa. Oh and did I mention it’s also a watch😊",5
1,"I love this a watch, so many additional features added over the Vrrsa I. I like that Alexa is coordinated and i can get my messages and. respond.i can set timers and alarms rigjt from wstvh.",5
0,"Started giving either 72bpm or 0bpm after 18 mos, Fitbit only offered 35% off a new one. :/ Will probably just buy an apple watch",1
0,"The look and design is nice but the functionality is a joke. This was my first Fitbit device it was for a Christmas gift and it will definitely be the last. The watch wont connect to a Samsung Galaxy s9, lg phone and a Samsung tablet or wifi. It wouldn't pair with bluetooth. After multiple attempts it finally connected to the s9 but then it would connect to my wifi. This product is junk it should not be this difficult to pair a device or connect to wifi. I have many bluetooth and wifi connected devices and nothing has frustrated me as much as this fitbit. The only thing it fits is the garbage. I will be sending it back.",1
1,I have a Versa 2 and love it. Hubby's Charge 3 was so outdated so got him a Versa 2. He loves it.,5
1,I debated for some time about what to buy...Apple or Fitbit. I decided on the Versa 2 and am happy I did. I like the level of detail you get on the exercise and sleep app. It is comfortable to wear and I look forward to learning about more features as I wear it.,5
1,"the app is glitchy, when first installed updated itself as long as i kept location and bluetooth activated...now have to manually sinc and it takes more attempts every day",5
0,"I just received my versa 2 today took it out the box down loaded the app and put it on the charger to find it doesn't work at all, it would not even charge. Now I'm sending it back to the Fitbit company for a replacement. 🙊😮 I hope I don't experience the same thing dealing with the company.",1
1,Love love love this watch!. The versa lit kept giving me problems but this watch tracks my workouts and heart rate very well. Plus it tracks stairs climbed,5
0,Paying for prime my watch could never tell my stats properly It worked on the watchonce or twice at the very beginning so I’m paying extra for something that’s not working so give the watch 2 give the app Prime has never done nothing it said it would!!! That’s my main issue swindled!!! And money wasted!!!,2
1,Bought this for my wife and she loves it. Especially while at work it helps with notifications so she doesn't have to reach for her phone while working. The sleep tracking and recent O2 update work well too. She has bought several bands and found the smaller thinner ones are more comfortable.,5
1,"I absolutely love my Fitbit versa! I was never a “watch person” in general prior to having my versa but I wanted to track my steps and sleep so I decided to try this out . Now, I’m obsessed and can’t not have it on! It’s everything I wanted in a watch and I’m using features on it that I never thought I would use. It’s very accurate and gives great insight on your sleep habits! Highly recommend!!!!",5
1,"Haven't use for sleep yet, but everything else is so easy, set up on phone, tracks your steps, running, biking, put onyour phone food you ate and how much water you drink, shows calories you burn, and calories you ate, like Alexa but wish had speaker, but works great!",5
1,"The app that comes with the watch is very cool, it not only tracks your steps, calories burned but also sleep. there is also a section that you can track your food intake and it tells you how many calories you have left to eat each day. This is worth much more than the cost of the watch. Love it.",5
0,This is the most difficult thing to work through to get support and fulfillment of the extended warranty for which I paid for. I recommend that you never purchase any type of warranty from this firm.We had the original watch (product) extended warranty and couldn't get anything done other than the support from the manufacturer.,1
1,This watch is awesome so far. I had the versa and its similar but much more and longer battery on the versa 2 it looks great too! I did buy a water proof band and changed it and I love how u can change the bands its great,5
1,"I needed to be able to get phone call notices. It wasn't easy to sinc with my android phone, took about a week to do so. Maybe it was me not the phone, now it is working. Hope it continues when I am away from home.",4
1,"This was a Christmas gift from my husband. I like these features: Sleep, steps taken, and heart bet.",5
1,"Love my Fitbit Versa 2! Tracks my bike riding via GPS, and Pilates. Has come a long way from original FitBit. I like it has similar features as an AppleWatch minus the phone and text features which I’m alright with since I don’t like to always be “plugged in” to the rest of the world when I’m exercising. Love it!",5
1,"I like that this Fitbit is not too complex but at times it says not connected to bluetooth when it's connected. I like rust I can answer my phone calls from the Fitbit but you need to be connected to some form of bluetooth device, example; headset, car device, etc.",5
1,It is a great watch with a comfortable band. The clock face is easy to read. I like that you can keep up with your heart rate and sleep as well as steps. I have not figured out all the app offers but I am learning and I am not willing to change back to a regular wrist watch.,5
1,"It does all the work for you, links to your fitness apps, emails at 25% battery life to inform you it needs to be charged. I receive notifications on my watch and every 10mins to the hour it tells you to get moving! Great watch, works better than expected!",5
1,So far so good. My daughter got this for Christmas. Will come back with a more thorough review later.,5
0,receive the watch and worked great for the first couple months. Then the screen started to lock up and the watch became just a watch. Tech support was very bad - wanted me to call back at least 6 more times before they could do anything even though the Fitbit bulletin board is filed with complaints about this. The person I spoke to had no idea about the issue I was told to keep rebooting it - 5 times a day now. Check their Site before buying.,1
0,"No Instructions, will not connect to Alexa, will not stay connected to phone (note 9), it takes a rocket scientist to program and keep this Fit Bit operating. Called to get help with operation and was connected to some foreign country and some who barely spoke english.",1
1,"Guys are trying to hit on me on the app. I'm using Fitbit for my personal health, not a dating site! Jeez... SMH",3
0,I got this a little over a year ago for Christmas and did not use it until September of this year as my old one finally gave out. Less than 6 months later this POS will not sync will not tell the right time and decided to remove itself from the fabulous (sarcasm) fit bit app. Never again what junk. If you could give a negative number I would say -10.,1
1,"I had a different smart watch, but saw this one and fell in love with it. It's everything that I hoped it would be. The only negative is when I check the weather and try to use alexa, it often tells me to sync the app. But other than that, I have no complaints.",5
1,"This is the best buy I made this year! I love the prompts, incoming calls and texts, relax mode and so much more! The more information you put in, the more you'll get out of this Versa 2 fitbit.",5
1,My last Fitbit screen stopped working after a few years and I chose this to upgrade! I love that Fitbit is constantly improving their apps and features. I tried an iWatch at one point and went back to the Fitbit after a month.,5
0,Worst band ever!! I'm not going to wear a watch that is uncomfortable. Try switching out the band for one you like....its impossible with the design. I'm not happy with this purchase at all. Find a better watch design. Also like with every fitbit I've ever owned the heart rate monitor sucks! I keep hoping each new watch will get better but they don't. Should have paid the extra money for the Garmin.,1
1,"I really like the features and product but it makes my wrist break out after a few days of wearing. I wash underneath it, daily like Apple said but still break out to the point of bleeding.",4
1,"There are good points and some not so good compared to my Apple Watch. I’m not sure why I get such different results with each. With the Versa, it says I burn more calories daily. With the Apple Watch it says I do way more steps and miles. Not sure which is right.",5
1,"Works good with tracking, steps calories, water, sleep, etc. Wish I could answer my phone.",5
0,"1 year warranty on battery. 1.5 years later the battery only lasts 1/2 a day.Good screen, nice functionality, unacceptable on the battery.",2
1,I didn’t think I would figure this out as quickly as I did. It is very user friendly.I did break out from the band but I found a lot of options and ordered a couple different bands and they fixed my problem.,5
0,We were not aware that this watch does not sync well with my daughter's phone. Therefore she has frequent connection problems and it doesn't work as well as we had hoped for reading and replying to text messages,2
1,I am really not happy with this fit bit I wish I had retur ed it. I have to go online to get my info I thought this would be all in one I could see info on watch,3
1,"I like it, it works well. The Alexa feature craps out a lot, I have to log into the app right before using it which is kinda pointless but everything else it’s supposed to do.. works great",5
0,I have had probably 10 different Fitbit devices over the years and am done. The Versa 2 is the worst one yet. The HR monitor reads wrong when doing workouts. The GPS through the phone doesn't stay connected unless the phone is turned on. Also have sync issues and have to reset the watch about twice a day. Switching to Garmin,2
0,"I like the watch, but the battery life is not good at all. It says it will last six days and it only lasts two. The other features work fine, not as big if step up from my last Fitbit I thought it would be.",2
1,"Beautiful, lightweight. The apps are limited, but is very useful for the gym. You can received notification of calls or text, but not answers the cellphone. I like the option of using Pandora offline when I am in the gym routine.",5
1,"At first, I was really impressed with this product. In general this is better than my charge 2, but one problem that I've noticed is that Bluetooth connectivity is intermittent when trying to use any of the control features or Alexa. Additionally, the watch face keeps changing back to the original settings and I have to go into the app to change it back to my preferred watch face configuration every so often.",3
1,"Everything is great except for the fact that randomly, intermittently, my Alexa doesn't work on this watch and it won't sleep track because it hasn't synced. I don't know how to set it to constantly sync to my phone so I don't have to keep doing it manually",4
1,"Watch seems good so far. Definitely a step up over my Charge 2 HR. But the strap attachment design- horrible. Makes me wonder if these guys did a usability study! I guess that conversation went something like “No one is going to change their strap all the time”. WHY Fitbit, WHY??",3
1,"My mom has had a fit bit for years now and this one is her favorite one by far. She reads her texts on it, but more importantly to her, it keeps up with steps well. She wears it 24/7 and has been for a year now and it still looks brand new. We haven’t had any issues with it.",5
1,"I love my Versa 2 more than my Apple Watch! Better features and tracking, more accurate, better customization options. My only complaint is that the text/email/call notifications stop working fairly often and I have to turn my Versa off and back on. Dropped from 5 stars to 4 due to this. Otherwise, no complaints! Just bought a second for my daughter!",4
0,I've had the product for about a year and a half and during that time it rarely would connect to my iphone while riding my bike which is the main reason I bought it. The other day the heart rate monitor stopped working and now it won't turn on at all. I can reset it for just a few seconds and it shows fully charged. I expected a lot more from this product and will not be buying another.,1
1,"This watch is so useful. It has so many more features than my previous fitbit, and it's really good quality. You can add lots of apps to it. The display is efficient and responsive. I definitely recommend getting a screen protector/case for it, because it has a big screen that could be very vulnerable, especially during a workout. I have had previous fitbits get very roughed up. This is definitely one that you want to protect.",5
1,The watch has a lot of features but it's not easy to program. My daughter who has an Apple watch programmed it for me but I still need to complete the process. Tedious process.,3
1,"This is my 3rd fitbit and the the older ones are much better. For the first week it worked fine, but now ma having trouble synching it with my phone app. I am not getting any notifications. I tried factory reset but that didnt solve the issue either.",3
1,"This is my first ""smartwatch"" and I am not disappointed at all. It's accurate, and amazing. You just glance at it, and it pops up all of the information on your screen. It always shows the time, and it almost always gets very accurate readings for my sleep. As someone who has health problems and needs to keep track of sleep, heart rate, and food and water intake, it's perfect.",5
1,She loves it! We debated buying the brand of smartwatch made for her phone(Android) but decided on the Versa2. She couldn't be happier. She is has sensitive skin and the silicone band bothered her after a week or so. I found some nice cloth bands on Amazon and she is good to go. I highly recommend the Versa2.,5
1,I don't have any experience with other fitness trackers but I love this one. It's amazing how seeing a measurable metric completely changes the way you approach your daily routine. A simple thing like entering how much water you drink keeps you aware of your daily goal. Rhe sleep feature is also an indispensable tool. I love how it breaks down the type and time you sleep as well as how much restorative rest you actually get each night. I would highly recommend getting the premium service to get the most nformation. Can't wait until they release the blood o2 feature. More info more better!!!,5
1,"It is a good watch! super cool, but I read a lot since I feel pain when I use the watch and discovered that some people feel the same pain and it is not because is used tightly, but is something else I would recomend to use a smartwatch for a couple of days and try if your skin, nerves and everyting feel ok, so then buy one :) aside of this, it is a pretty cool device.",3
1,I have the Fitbit Sense and today is day six of boy having it on the charger and I use it for literally everything and it's just now at 36% remaining battery life!! I work in a nursing home and can't really have my phone on me so the fact that I can have my watch track my health and give me all my notifications without worrying about it dying on me is amazing!,5
1,"The watch arrived in a really nice box and came complete with everything you need. Setting up is really quick and seamless and was able to have it running and ready for use in minutes.Overall I really like the design, it's not too flashy and looks really good when wearing. The controls while wearing are very simple and can be figured out in no time.I have not used it while sleeping, that isn't one of the things I was looking to get out of having this watch. With that said I usually put it on charge every night with it still having 90% or more battery life left.This is my second Fitbit and third smartwatch and this is hands down my favorite. Highly recommend.",5
0,"I wish I could give it 0 zero stars. I purchased my fitbit in October of 2020, unfortunately it stop working in May of 2021. I called and spoke with several reps at fitbit and they were of no help. Very disappointed, I'm never buying another fitbit again. VERY DISAPPOINTED 😞",1
1,"Like what it does- calories, steps, heart, time. Like that it encourages me to move.",5
0,"I don't love this watch. It doesn't hold a charge very long (3 -4 days). Sometimes it won't light up when I check the time. I tap on it and push the button on the side and it still doesn't work. I've had 2 other models of the Fitbit, older less advanced ones, and I liked them better.",2
0,I bought this for my Mom for Christmas 2019 (8 months ago) and the face of the watch has popped off already. The return window has closed for this purchase so I'm assuming I have to go through the manufacturer.,2
0,"I've had a fitbit since 2014. I've been a huge Fitbit fan from the beginning. I recieved the Fitbit Versa 2 as an early Christmas present in early December 2019. Let me say that I have NEVER had this much trouble with any other Fitbit. It loses connection r as randomly and I still have to uninstall the app, restart the device and start over. This has been a very frustrating month. I will say that the Fitbit customer service has been amazing. I wouldnt go with yhe Versa 2. I miss my Charge 2.",2
1,Love it works great. Sync with phone with ease. Still figuring out how a lot of the apps work. Some apps don’t work the greatest. Struggle to get Spotify of music apps to work through the watch,5
1,"This was a gift for my wife. She loves the upgrade to Versa 2 from her old FitBit Charge 2. I chose this Amazon exclusive color hoping that it would look better than the standard smart watch. She loves the color, and has gotten compliments, as well.",5
1,"I love the watch but doesn’t stay charged very long. I only use for tracking footsteps, sleep, heart rate and calories. I have to charge about every 4 days.",3
0,"I use this product not only for the amount of steps and calories burned during exercise but also to track my sleep. Most of the time I got simplified sleep results, there was not details on the amount of deep sleep or REM. I called Customer Service, they rebooted my watch the problem persisted. I did tried many different ways to fix the problem, but nothing worked.",1
1,I got this to check my pulse and keep and eye on it for heart condition reasons and there is no way to make the pulse bigger on the main screen. The options to change the clock all DONT look normal either. I wanted something simple. I did notice by wearing it for less than two hours that my wrist was red. Beware. Clean the band as there’s no way for it to breathe against your skin.,3
0,The Versa2 has serious issues connecting to my iPhone and/or iPad! It also will not connect if there is a Surge anywhere in the house. I am ready to put it away and get a different smart watch.,1
1,I had a Versa and it finally quit so I bought this one. I love the features. Better than an Apple even though I have an iPhone. I love the sleep tracking. And this one has Alexa and a wallet pay.,5
0,This is my second Fitbit product and I can tell you that it will be my last! I figured that I would give Fitbit one more chance and again they have let me down. The first device the battery died just as soon as the warranty expired. The Versa 2 within 6 months started going into a locked up screen scenario and became totally unresponsive. Luckily it is under warranty now so I'm hoping I can get them to replace it. If i get another device to replace this one i will see what i can do to sell it online instead of actually using it and re-coop some of my money!,1
0,"I bought this was watch from this company one month ago, and about a week ago the watch started to have issues like not turning on, scrolling, lighting up or responding to touch. It’s not an inexpensive device. This is extremely frustrating. I haven’t had issues with any of my Fitbits in the past, but I’m really not pleased with how this product is turning out. It was really nice until it decided to not work properly.",2
1,Like the watch but the biggest part I dislike is the heart rate isn’t accurate. I’ll be sitting doing nothing and my heart rate isn’t high but will say it’s in the 90s then i workout and can tell my heart rate is high and says it’s in the 70s. So I like the watch but I wouldn’t say the heart rate is accurate therefore exercise tracking and calorie burn is pretty inaccurate,3
1,"I love the exercise tracking so I can see when I’m reaching my peak, cardio zone, or fat burn.I’m also mindful of my sleep and the tracker helps me monitor my efforts.The band is better on the Versa 2, though I had to order extra strap bands after 7 months.",5
0,"Seems like the life span on these watches are approx 1 year. A friend's own stopped working 11 months in and it was exchanged and a few months after the warranty period of 1 year, my own just shut off and little to no assistance was given by fitbit. Definitely not worth it if I have to pay 200us for a new one every year.",1
1,I upgraded from the Blaze. This is truly waterproof. Better interface with app- tracks more activities. The watch band stays clean. The Blaze caused a recurring dermatitis under watch itself- no skin irritation with this new model.,5
1,"Updated my Fitbit (Charge 2) to the Versa, I really love it and have had no problems (been wearing it 2 weeks now) I love the flexibility of the Versa.",5
1,Purchased for my Mother in law. She loves it. Very stylish and durable. Good value,5
0,"Trying to replace the Charge2. I can't get it up connect to wifi, even tried switching to 2.4 from 5ghz. It's so slow, it tried to update via bluetooth. It advertised a 20 minute update, hours later, no progress. Let's start the return process, this is trash.",1
1,"The battery life doesn't seem to be as long as the versa one. It's also irritating that you now have to pay a ""premium"" for sleep patterns and what not. The screen is crisp and flashy but it's definitely worth the investment to get a screen protector or case.",4
1,"Was easy to set up and sync to my phone, seems very accurate! Fits great! Very durable!",5
1,The sleep tracking kind of off but I like everything else about this watch. The only big issue is the band. If I wear it for two days on either wrist I break out really bad from it. I have scars on my left wrist from this happening. I thought maybe I had just gotten it wet and that caused the irratation but after taking every precaution to not get it wet this is still happening. So I'll be purchasing a different band.,4
1,"I have used Fitbit products for years, the smart watch features are nice. I only wish it worked with iOS for calls and texts. It’s not an Apple Watch, but it is a good product",4
1,"Amazon sells extra bands in various colors for this watch, and clip on covers for the crystal, I recommend them highly. She gets many compliments.",5
0,Ive only had this versa 2 for 2 years and i cant get the battery to charge at all anymore. The display says the source doesnt have enough power to charge it ...even though ive triec it with multiple cords bricks and outlets all with the same result.Dont buy this unless you want to replace it soon.,1
0,I have received a defective item and now I am waiting almost 1 month to get my refund. This seller is shady. I will never recommend this seller to anybody.,1
1,I bought this mainly to control spotify while work. (Deliver packages) I have to sync with the app kinda often but that may be an issue with my phone. I tried about 5 different smart watches that were under $100. All of them were not good quality. This 1 was the best but had to spend the money for quality.,5
0,"Just after the warranty ended, it started malfunctioning. They won't replace it or fix it - but they offered me a discount off of another one. As if I would! Save yourself some time and money...don't buy fitbit products! They are TRrraaSsssh! TRASH! Amazon should stop selling their products!",1
1,So far so good. Works well at tracking steps and on my runs. I haven't used all the features yet but that will come in time. The one thing I'm disappointed about is the exercise app won't recognize yoga anymore. Kind of a bummer,5
1,Like the old versions can’t change the battery is still an issues. Lack of free clock face apps. But all and all is you know what your getting.,4
1,I like the Versa 2 a lot. I love the way it tracks my sleep and the smart features are amazing. I fell in love with Fitbit every since my son gave me the charge 3 for my birthday.,5
1,I love the fitbit watches. I only hope that the vibration can be fully turned off without having to turn off all the notifications. I would like to receive the notifications but apparently the only way to turn of vibration is to turn notification off. It would also help if if vibrating mode is cutomizable per app,5
1,Does everything it says I don't wear it to sleep cuz it's kind of bulky the strap is shorter than I would like but it has excellent features and I'm still learning it unclear on how to get the Alexa to work but the price was very good price point for Christmas,5
0,"I have had this watch for 11 months. It died for good this past weekend. I thought I would try it as I previously owned the Garmin Vivoactive 3 which also died after about a year. However, at least the Garmin provided more functions that worked. The Fitbit Versa did not accurately track strenuous activity, nor did the GPS or heart rate monitor ever work. I used primarily for steps but these others features would have been nice on occasion. I do not plan to replace with Fitbit product, just too unreliable.",2
0,"I love fitbit an I love everything alexa .but 2 days now I cannot get alexa to work ? I KNOW I am trying EVERYTHING! I will keep trying till it maybe comes around so will keep you informed ! backstory : bought a ONE , inspire,CHARGE, now a versa,,use the ONE the MOST so sad the stopped making them!!",2
0,"I lost track of the # of Fitbit products I've owned but all have very short life spans due to faulty bands, lack of resistance to water & lack of resistance to heat. I purchased a service agreement & they will only replace your device once despite repetitive manufacturer defects. They must use a low quality adhesive on the face of these devices and I have had at least 4 devices where the face detached. Buy any product BUT Fitbit!!!!! They say a picture is worth a thousand words!",1
1,"I have really enjoyed this watch, but have had a problem with Alexa staying connected, it goes off, and you can not use the speaker. I could not fix it till I called customer service!!",5
1,My husband got me one as a surprise and I surprised him with this one! It was 50 bucks off when we purchased so it was only 150.00. It looks like an Apple Watch. People can’t believe it’s a Fitbit. I love it!,5
1,I LOVE IT!!!💜💜💜 but When you are blind as a bat and can not findyour cheater readers The Instructions are microscopic it sucked. Then I finally got it charged and read was great,5
0,Nice watch but the battery only last 2 or 3 days. If I would of kept the box I would of returned it.,2
1,The treadmill steps are definitely off without calibration. Also the interchangeable bands are a LOT more difficult to deal with vs the older easier versions of Fitbit. Functionality wise it’s certainly a step up from older fit bits and good vs Apple Watch prices,5
0,"Fitbit user for years, despite drawbacks. Disappointed in this model. Prone to scratches, awful at Bluetooth synching. Have been trying to synch latest update for two days now, won't work even with resetting. Never had a product line worse with Bluetooth.",2
1,No problems with the app or syncing my iPhone. Works exactly how I expected it to. 5 day battery life before I need to charge again. The band in the picture is not the one that came with it. I am very happy with this Vera 2,4
1,Great fitness/smart watch with the emphasis on fitness .. great battery life and sleep tracking .. many faces available including a personal pic if you choose.. and it’s visually beautiful.. I love my Versa 2.,5
1,I have always loved my Fit Bit but LOVE the Versa2. The only thing I would say negatively about it is the step tracker. At times it does not seem as accurate as I feel it should be and counts steps when my hand shakes. Other than that I have zero problems. It was super easy to connect and I love the app and all that comes with the app!,4
1,"Purchased 7 months ago and now will not syn or reset. Don't recommend.After contact with support team, they were able to fix on line. For that reason changing to 5 stars as it works fine.",4
0,Don’t expect this watch to last more than a year. Absolute garbage and if it’s out of the limited warranty don’t expect FitBit to do anything for you to make it right. Spend a little bit more and buy a AppleWatch.,1
0,"I want to love this product, but it is hard to enjoy something when you spend money to get something new and receive something that isn't even refurbished quality, not even complete. I am beyond pissed that Amazon would send out an opened, scratched up watch without the charger and charge full price. We will see how the replacement is, but if it is anything like this I will be taking my business elsewhere.",1
1,It’s new my last one got wet - but it’s returned to working. I like the pale pink - last one was aqua - liked it too but it’s nice to change...,4
1,"I love you Fitbit but sometimes it doesn’t sync to my app on my iPhone. I have to uninstall and reinstall the app, that sucks.",4
0,My fitbit no longer charges or turns on. I bought it may 2020. Don't bother. My versa lasted me two years and only because I lost it. The versa two is straight poo. Not worth the money.,1
0,"I have use the fitbit for 2 months and from time to time the screen freezes. I have it on save mode, but when I wan to see the time or cal burned it shows a black square in the middle and cant see anything now. It has been like this for 3 days now. I can;t use it because I can;t see anything... Not very long durantion for the paid price.",2
1,This watch Is better than the previous version I had but still is not as advanced as I was hoping. Changing the band is a chore with the little pins and it’s not done with ease. It does work for tracking but it is not accurate all the time,4
1,"Enjoying Alexa and messages on wrist. Wish I could get Messenger as well as text messages. Occasional trouble syncing, but overall works very well. Nice bright display. Love that it is waterproof.",4
1,"Wasted hours and hours trying to sync and update my Versa 2 via desktop app, browser-based app, and android-phone-based app.No go.Finally tried via iPad. Instant success.",5
0,"I purchased this product about 30 days ago. I have a T-Mobile LG REVVL android . I did not immediately return the Fit Bit becuase I thought I was doing something wrong- I dutifully worked through all of the help pages, the customer services, the Q and A- I am 4 days late in getting my refund and I am eating $150.00. Apparently FitBit only works with 3 phones. They do not work with standard T Mobile Android LG phones. This is a disgrace and I am very upset. I feel this is criminal.",1
1,"Everything works perfectly (I checked the step counter against actual steps), except the sleep monitor. It logs sleep time when I am just laying in bed watching a movie.",5
1,"I don't have much to compare this too except one of those cheaper trackers you find sold on Amazon. But I'm still really impressed. I haven't experienced any glitching, it seems mostly accurate, at times it could be exaggerating calories and steps but nothing to really throw a person off. I like it. Its comfortable to wear. Its fun to use.",5
1,I love my fit bit! It’s so pretty and it’s a step up from my old one! It helps track everything I want to and I love there is a clock! It stays changed way longer the Apple Watch I had(hated it). I highly recommend it!,5
1,Loved it until it abruptly stopped keeping a charge about 20 months after I bought it. I'm not sure if this is normal or not.,3
1,"I love this watch. I had the lite but this allows talk text, so awesome! Works great with my Samsung S 20 and once the latest update completes on the watch even the SpO works. I love it",5
0,"It is a good product BUT they die too quickly. i initially bought 2 Versa 2 and within the first year, they died and had 2 replacements. Surprisingly one of the replacement died again. The 2 replacements eventually died 6 months after and here i am having spent around $350 and it lasted for 1.5 years only. I would not recommend fitbit due to its poor durability and customer service.",1
1,"Big improvement over my previous two Fitbits. Bright, logical display, easy-to-emgage charger. Battery life is excellent.",5
1,"This is a good Smart watch. Does everything I wanted in a watch. I wanted it for the fitness to help loose weight. I did not realize how many other apps that you can add to it, which is great. I also love the Alexa feature. The quick response to text messages is a really nice feature as well. I would definitely recommend this smart watch.",5
1,"Would highly recommend this product. Love everything about the Fitbit versa 2. Constant heart rate tracking, sleep tracking, step tracking and more. I’ve worn it every day and night since owning it. Only takes about two hours to charge around every 4-6 days.",5
1,I paid a LOT for my Fitbit but this one was a reasonable price and works just as good as mine. I would recommend this Fitbit.,5
1,Watch was bought for my daughter to follow her blood sugars on her watch. She is an active 9 years old and she loves it. Battery life is good and she is very pleased with it this far.,5
1,"Not gonna lie, I was expecting better. The Alexa rarly works, spotify is useless even in you have the premium. I've tried several time to fix it but it never seems to connect to my phone. Some apps just does not work. And over all the watch is pretty wonky. You would probably get a better deal from apple watch or Samsung. The only difference is the the battery and the sleep tracker. The app oh my lord is horrible!!!! I have my watch connected to my phone but the app takes probably a year before it sincs. Updates... Good luck, you may stay there for hours",3
1,I had tried a Fitbit in the past with subpar results But this tracker is EXCELLENT!,5
1,An upgrade from my last one. Not sure on all it can do as of yet. Quite a bit more to this one than my old one. Still learning about its capabilities.,5
1,"The Fitbit itself is wonderful. Unfortunately after wearing it for two weeks, I had a skin reaction to the silicone or rubber band that comes with it. My skin dried and started to look like a burn. So I ordered a leather band.",5
1,It tracked my sleep for about the first week and has never tracked it again. This was one of the main reasons I bought the watch. Also had to order a new strap. The rubber strap it came with caused my wrist to sweat and irritate my skin. I do appreciate the step and heart rate tracking. If I can't resolve the sleep tracking issue I will have to find a better quality.,3
0,DO NOT BUY! This was made by 3rd party developer according to Fitbit customer service so not all apps will be available. I am returning mine.photo on left is what I received. On the right is the Real Fitbit,1
1,Haven't set up yet.I assume will work well as has been the case with other FITBIT products.Having difficulty bringing up the clock face.Have tried different settings and all was well however today not happening.Bill,4
1,So far so good. My Fitbit is tracking my activity pretty accurately. I thought it also had the phone alert feature but for the price and the accuracy I am good.,5
0,I like my old blaze WAY better. This one CONSTANTLY has issues syncing with all my devices and I know it's not my devices because they connect NP with other bluetooth devices. Also has issues in the AP contesting to wifi. My husband's has the same issues.,2
1,"Love this watch so far. I've had it for about two weeks. I get reliable notifications for all of my apps, and can even use voice to text to respond to text messages. Battery life is amazing. For example, I charged it Sunday night this week. It is now Friday at 10am, and I still have over 40% battery left. I haven't been listening to music on it much, but I imagine that will drain the battery faster. 👍 There aren't a ton of apps, but it has all of the functionality that I need and more.",5
0,"The watch is fine but the app is full of bugs and glitches and ruins the whole experience. On the forums, many other people experience the same problems and most don't have fixes. This is my second Fitbit and after all the problems with the first one it's my blame for trying to give Fitbit another chance.",1
1,I'm not good with technology but this gadget was easy enough to use. It helps me keep track of workouts that I would guesstimate on.It somehow knows when I'm sleeping and tracks that pretty well and the sleep score is pretty accurate. I can't wait to use it to help me lose 30 more lbs.,5
0,"I just recently purchased my FitBit Versa and I absolutely loved all the features, however after wearing it daily and taking off as necessary I noticed my skin was discolored, peeling, and bruised where the face of the watch and the band rest. I am totally shocked by this and wonder why this is happening. I do not wear it to tight, however I do wear it to bed.",2
0,"I had this for less than a year when it just stopped. I contacted Fitbit, and they just gave me a “We don’t know what’s up” response. I’ll never buy another Fitbit because of this.",2
0,"The display just went dead. Charge is only down to 36%. Have placed a screen protector on it and have not been close to water. My return window closed just a week ago. Ordered on May 21, today is June 28. VERY DISCUSTED. $159.00 WASTED!!!!!!!",1
1,I like the heart rate and cardio fitness score tracker. I also like the accuracy of the steps taken as this accounts for the calories I can eat. One thing I don’t like is that when I work out the sweat under the Fitbit blocks the heart rate monitor from working. I wish they could fix this.I also don’t like that sometimes the app and the Fitbit won’t sync even when Bluetooth is on. I’ve had to delete the app before and also restart the Fitbit for it to work.I also wish the “always on” function hard a longer battery life. It’s currently about 2 days long.,4
1,"Haven’t had this a year, and the display isn’t working! It’s fully charged. It was fine, and then it wasn’t. Also didn’t register today’s steps",5
0,I bought this watch in Nov 2019. 15 months later the screen suddenly detached and only shows the time. I can’t sync with the app cause it can’t find the watch.The worst part is that I’ve tried to reach Fitbit’s customer service and nobody answers the phone and the email says that yo have to call them. I’ve tried to find out where I can repair it and nobody knows.Too expensive for 15 months!!!,1
1,"I have had a Blaze for years and purchased the versa 2 simply because of the price. My blaze still works fine, but I find that I am wearing this one more due to the upgraded features. I stick with fitbit because, if it ain't broke....don't fix it.",5
0,I’m a school bus driver and it counts thousands of steps while I’m driving my 60 minute bus route. I had a garmin previously with no issues. Other than the counting steps when I’m obviously not walking I like it. The large display is easy to see which is helpful to stay on time during my bus route but the inaccurate tracking while driving makes it worthless really. I will definitely be switching back to garmin.,2
1,"This is the third one I buy for my kids because they love it so much. The many functions even inspire my laid-back son to put down the video games and exercise to reach the ""goals""! He actually lost weight doing it! Double bonus!",5
1,The person who designed the way you attach the band aught to be shot. The little spring is easily lost and hard to attach. I have run out of springs so I have to carry my watch in my pocket.,4
1,I love this FitBit!!! I had a knock off version of this and it broke within a few weeks. When I got this Versa 2 I was so excited to see all of its features and I was amazed at how many things it could do! I adore this product!!!,5
1,"Love the fact I can have 5 different clock faces on it. I haven't used a lot of the other features. Alexa worked once or twice, and it doesn't alway update through the phone app when I try to sync it. Heart rate, calories and steps work well.",4
1,Heart rate is not as accurate as my charge 2. I am not happy because that was the maine reason to get this versa 2. it doesn't seem to catch on when I have tachycardia episode nearly all the time.,3
1,"Easy to work app , love checking my sleep track and challenging friends to steps . Watching my heart rate as a heart patient is totally cool . Don't really use my Alexa much on here but I did add it . There is so much to do and so much to learn .",5
0,"I’ve worn my Versa 2 for 54 days and nights, out of those nights it has tracked my sleep 34 times, a 65% success rate. However, over time it’s gotten worse, out of the last 24 nights the watch has tracked my sleep 13 times, a 52% success rate. I’ve tried everything that Fitbit recommended. I wore the watch tighter, I moved the watch higher on my wrist, I rebooted the watch and app, made sure the watch was charged, and the watch still records intermittently. I also downloaded the golf GPS Pro, another waste of money.",2
1,"I gave to my husband and he loves it for counting steps, weather, and many other little things that he hasn't investigated yet.",5
1,This watch keeps track of a lot of different exercises unlike the charge that I used to have. Great face and you can change it regularly.,5
0,Fitbit app works great - the watch itself DOES NOT!! Screen constantly froze and now mine will not even budge (can’t swipe or use any apps) and the notifications/messages/calls do not work at all if you have an iPhone. The watch also dies CONSTANTLY - save yourself the money and hassle.,1
1,"I love the sleep tracker.I think the steps are exaggerated, but if everyone I know is competing for steps with the same devise it all evens out, right?I am enjoying it immensely",5
1,This is the second FitBit I have purchased this year. It was a birthday gift for my boyfriend but we ended up breaking up the week after I gave it to him... I love mine so it gets a good review... I am just disappointed I wasted money on a good for nothing scrub.,5
1,Just what I wanted and didn’t have to pay the high price of aN Apple watch.,5
1,"I love my two Fitbit versas!They are waterproof, track your steps, heart rate, sleep and more. I swim everyday and it holds up underwater",5
0,i love having the fitbit versa to track my sleep but when my previous one broke after about 2 yrs I bought this one. now less than 3 months later it is not working the screen is completely black. it is still tracking stuff but i can not see the screen. i am disheartened and do not want to buy another one - it is a huge investment for it to break within 3 months.,1
1,Stylish and functional. This gives you more than tracking steps. This Fitbit allows you to dig into your health more and has functions that are useful outside of the health journey.,5
1,"I'm so glad I chose this over spending hundreds more dollars on an apple watch. The watches charges really fast and it has so many options. I have told a bunch of my friends about my watch, it works great and it's lightweight.",5
0,Very disappointed with this fitbit. It constantly looses connection and does not sync. I have to pair with my app over and over again. It restarts on it's own from time to time and even freezes up. It worked fine the first three weeks but then started having numerous issues. I do not recommend until they fix these issues. I don't even wear it anymore and spent over $200 on it.,1
1,I have had some problems with this watch. The folks at fitbit have been helpful but their directions are no always clear. After the first time I had to resynch the watch the notification(phone call and messanging) no longer worked. Everything else has been working well except for this. This is why i bought the watch and I am very disappointed that this issue has not been resolved.,4
1,"Perfect, just as if I bought it from the store! Came in a cute package, works well, and super easy to use. Tracks calories and steps!! Just make sure to download Fitbit app on phone",5
1,Very good product,5
0,"I bought this product b/c it apparently did not need charging all the time. My old Fitbit needed a charge every 3 days so I sprung for a new Fitbit Versa 2. So disappointed. I continually see that my device needs to be charged. I charged it Saturday, April 11, and again, after a 100% charge, I needed to charge it again yesterday.",1
0,"Upon opening the package, the watch appears to have been worn and damaged. The screen looks like it was submerged in water, and someone returned it. I have a replacement coming and will update my review as needed. Really disappointed so far.",1
1,"mobile app"", ""sleep tracking"" and ""smart features"" On the Versa 2 are great. I also really like the larger face on the watch. Didn’t need the GPS feature Versa 3 offers so this one has just enough bells and whistles for me.",5
1,"This Fitbit is amazing! I have had other Fitbit’s in the past and this one by far is the best!! I received it on Sep 4th and it had 70% power, it is almost midnight on the 10th and I am just now having to charge it. I haven’t taken it off either since the 4th.",5
1,"Overall this isn't all that much better than the original versa. Mostly I miss the 2 extra physical buttons. Also, while having an amoled is nice for contrast, the individual pixels seem more visible. I thought the Alexa integration would be nice but it's meh at best.",3
1,"I love my Fitbit Versa 2, it's working well tracks my steps, Heart rate and so much more that's why I am enjoying it. I would recommend such to everyone because it's a neat tool to be worn on your wrist. Love it",5
1,item was exactly as described except for the delivery; it said that package was handed to resident when in fact I found it laying on my driveway nowhere near a door or anything; looks like it was thrown out the window like the morning newspaper. very disappointing prime delivery,5
1,I've had this for about a month and I love it! After being diagnosed with afib keeping up with my heart rate is important. It has several great apps and the battery lasts a long time. Highly recommended for a smart watch.,5
0,Battery life is fast. It’s not 5 days.The strap is not comfortable and always flapping around.It’s not easy to navigate screen. I like my older fitbit way better. Hard for me to see the information. Perhaps not as intuitive. I’ll have to read more about to see if I can get this more to my liking. Right now it’s about a month and I’mNot impressed.,2
1,I like that it tracks all my steps including the stairs.I will be looking for another band soon.,5
0,I got this in December. It is now April. It was 100% charged last night and when I woke up this morning it was at 9% and within an hour it was dead. I have been at work all day without it and it is driving me crazy.,2
1,I love the fact its waterproof and the fact I only have to charge it once every 4-5 days. I absolutely upgraded from a fitbit Blazw to this lovely fit bit Versa 2.,5
1,Don’t waste your money for a special band trust me it’s NOT worth it. Watch is pretty good not as accurate as I thought it would be.,5
1,This is the 1st fitness tracker that has ever worked for me. I'm still learning how to fully use it. The on-line help is great.,5
1,"It lasted almost a year. Thank the Lord, another month and it would have been out of fit-bit warranty. Pretty cool watch, nice bio-metrics, steps all that...",5
1,"This is my 3rd Fitbit, started with the Flex, then Alta and now Versa. I love it. I have a medical condition, and this is a great product that really helps. This newer version with texts and seeing who is calling is a wonderful addition. I still need to go in and add some custom responses as I only have yes and no right now. The vibrating alarm reminder is stronger than previous models for taking my medicine. I highly recommend this product.",5
0,"I bought my Fitbit Versa 2 at the end of October last year. By March the watch just stopped working. I thought at first the battery had died, but come to find out, it wouldn't charge. I have other friends that have had the same problem, but they had their Fitbit for a couple of years. I only had mine 5 months! I'm very disappointed!!!! Otherwise, I would give the Fitbit four stars.",1
1,"battery life is several days, have had for over 1 year and no problems. love my versa 2.",5
0,Love this very much until the top just fell off. Now doesn't work any more. Makes me so mad.Just got a new one. Won't connect to wifi and won't connect to app. This sucks. Don't wast your time or money.,1
1,I live th is one! I had done so much research that it finally confused the F out of me! So I decided on this one only because I can control my music and I am a yoga teacher and wanted to track myself and control the music during class! I love that it tracks my sleeP to!,5
0,"Worked great for two weeks,then would not charge or display.Amazon,once we got back from vacation.showed pass return date.Total waste of money...",1
1,"I upgraded to the Versa 2 and it’s been great! The Alexa is fun and useful and I love the pin lock feature where it requires a PIN number after each time of taking it off and 24 hours with having personal information connecting to your phone. It tracks everything it says it does just fine and I love that it comes with two sets of bands, the ones shown and silicone ones as well. It fits nice and is an easy set up. If you’re looking for a nice upgrade then this is the one for you!",5
1,Overall no complaints other than it’s not worth the price for what you get. If I had to do again I’d just get a $30 one and be done with it or spend a little more and get the Apple Watch.,3
1,Accurate!! Use it everyday. Helps me to loose weight by tracking my calorie burn. Helps me to understand why I wasn’t sleeping so well. Tracked my sleep so I could track my behaviors.,5
1,"This is a nice upgrade from my Fitbit Blaze. Having Alexa on my wrist is a game changer! I use Fitbit mostly for sleep tracking, and this one seems just as efficient as the last. Good, long battery life. I also bought a screen protector cover to protect it. I definitely recommend one of those too.",5
0,this is not worth the money. It has to be charged every two days and the other functions on this watch does not work. I was happy when I got this because I got it for myself on my birthday and it has not work since January.,2
1,This is a great watch. Easy to set up.... even I could do it. So far So good.,5
1,"Because this watch has provided so much data to some physiology while I workout, I adjust my workout to perform better. My goals have increased. Because of my enthusiasm about my workouts, 2 family members bought the same watch. Now we encourage, share and support each other even though we are not in the same state.",5
0,Worked great. Wouldn’t update. FitBit won’t provide any assistance beyond a small discount on a replacement. NO THANKS,2
1,"I love the look and the sleep feature. I would like for this to track activities where you are not stepping. I am a pe teacher and we are currently doing a parachute unit. I am getting in a lot of activity but no steps. I would love to see my actual physical activity. Overall, I love this watch.",5
0,"La bateria dejo de funcionar de una dia para otro, no mantiene carga por mas de 6 horas. Lo compre hace tan solo 18 meses y por esa razon ya no apluca garantia. Revisen los foros de la comunidad fitbit y encontraran la cantidad de casos con la misma situacion. no se dejen enganar.After 18 moths the batterie doesn't work. warranty it not possible because is only for first year. Check cases in fitbit community about the same issue ii's terrible.",1
1,"This is a good watch. With vision issues, one can read the time and date on the face of the watch.",5
0,I purchased two of these October 2020. One for me and another as a gift.Now it is not functioning properly. It confidently started acting up after the return window in January 2021.A scam to purchase a new one?? I need to get a replacement or my money back.I cannot scroll. The screen is inactive to touch.,1
1,"Great for almost everything. Unreliable for notifications and syncing constantly.They will work sometimes and not others. Awesome for sleep, awesome for workouts and daily activity. GPS maps for my hikes and runs are accurate and fun to look at.",5
0,This is the second fit it versa 2 I have had that has stopped working. My original one is less than a year old and now the other one has stopped working as well and fitbit support is doing nothing about it. Just because your product is messing up should not mean I have to spend more money when it is still under warranty up to a year. Really disappointed jn fitbit customer support.,2
0,"Highly disappointed in this watch. I live in a house with 2 flights of stairs that i probably climb 20 times a day and by the time I go to bed, my stairs climbed says 1. I am also not confident that the steps are correct because I wake up with steps showing on my watch when I haven’t even been out of bed yet.",2
0,This is mot a good investment not easy to work and the screen is really hard to see. Just can’t understand why this has to be so confusing to operate.,2
1,Love my Fitbit the only thing I don’t like is you can’t do voice text with an apple phone which is what o have also I never use the built in Alexa and that’s why I bought this Fitbit was for Alexa all you can do is ask her questions and half the time she doesn’t work other wise if you are looking to actually track health and sleep this is a great product,4
1,I like it more than the far more expensive Apple watch it does most of the same things for me personally. I would purchase this item again,5
1,Good watch. Charger sensitive to charging source. Charges well plugged into computer. Not well plugged into multi plug usb charger source.,4
1,"Worked nicely until it just quit for no reason, no warning just dead.",5
0,"So even after reading the reviews I thought I'd give it a try because everyone didn't have a bad experience....got mine on Saturday, currently it's Monday morning and I still am unable to connect the fitbit to my phone. I've done everything! Paired/unpaired, deleted app/reinstalled, factory reset watch....literally everything! Idk if I should return it and hopefully get one that works when I order again. This is extremely frustrating!",1
1,"I bought this for my husband. Now he never misses my calls, can't exaggerate his daily steps, and at a better price than the other competitors, it gives us just what we needed to track his blood pressure and other health issues.",4
1,"I'm really liking my versa2. It's a very nice watch and tracker. I highly recommend a protective cover. I'm so glad I got one for mine. I smacked my watch against a door frame, and the only thing scratched was the cover.",5
1,Love my fitbit but the band that comes with it not so much! I had to take it off because it was leaving a mark that looked like a burn (wasnt a burn just looked like one)on my wrist from no air getting through. I ordered a new breathable band so hopefully that helps!,4
1,This is my fifth Fitbit and the best one so far. I like how it looks and all thefeatures it has that i don't use too much. I have a charge 2 but this is way better.,5
1,I had to return the first one because it wasn’t tracking but my new one works great!! I love my fitbit,5
1,My hands are now free to work and monitor phone activity hands free. Fitness information spot on and useful.,5
1,This fitbit is a replacement for the one I broke. This is a great fitness watch.,5
0,I was so excited to receive this product right before leaving for vacation but it arrived sealed and secure except it was missing the charger.,1
1,Bought as a gift. She didn't like the color of the watch or band. Returned and purchased a regular Fitbit Versa (silver). My bad for not considering she only wears silver - silver color accessories. :( P.S. She loves the silver Fitbit Versa. :),3
1,"Love trackimg steps, sleep, heart rate., etc. I can set goals and alerts to help me meet those goals.",5
1,"Daughter LOVES it. She wanted it for sleep tracking and seeing texts on her watch (when not near her phone). She also loves the premium fitbit App that can be purchased for $79/year (separately). Not sure we save any money over the Apple watch with the App (which is what she asked for), but she likes what she got.",5
0,"This is my second FitBit. I was hoping the first was a glitch in the system. I returned the first one due to inaccuracy in the GPS feature. Not only does it not track accurate pace while running, it also does not track accurate distance. Its too bad, because it is a pretty little watch. Back to Garmin for me.Build in music with Pandora or Spotify?? It requires premium accounts for both.",1
1,"Love the look and practically invisible feel of the band! Easily cleaned and fresh look that goes with any outfit. I love how easy it is to start a run and how it mostly begins the gps location to track my run. I’m a little disappointed at how fast the battery life runs out, but other than it this product is great!",4
0,"HEART RATE MONITOR SUCKS.I measured it. It reads 80 when I was going roughly at 120. Pretty disappointing, I love how it looks, but can't forgive this on a fitness tracker device.",1
1,This device is simply awesome! It is very accurate therefore your data is good data! I use my versa a long with MyFitnessPal to track my meals and exercise.,5
1,I love this watch! It's great that all the info I want to see is right on the home screen. I bought this Fitbit specifically because it's Alexa enabled & it stands true to its word! I can run all of my Alexa enabled devices right from my watch.,5
0,"2 months of use, and it stopped working.Customer Service for this product won’t do anything to help you!!Do not buy from Amazon !!!!!!!!Go directly to Fitbit, do not waste your money here. You will have a product that stopped woking within months and there is nothing you can do to get a replace or refund.Very disapointing",1
0,"Well, it was great while it lasted. Good battery life, easily visible screen and functions. BUT it just stopped working last night, 21 days after my return window closed!Update: YouTube to the rescue. I was able to restart it with a Help video"" I found. But I still want to sell it if anyone wants to make me an offer!",2
1,"After trying a different tracker, I purchased this one. This tracker has proven to be easy to use and adjustable to improve accuracy in some ways. Great tracker. This is my second Fitbit. Gave my old one to my son when I wanted to upgrade.",5
1,"I absolutely love this watch! Exactly what I was wanting! I used to have the Charge 2 so this was an awesome upgrade. At first I was skeptical because there were so many bad reviews about the setup process, but I had no trouble at all. If you want to use the Spotify option, you have to have a premium account, which I do and love this feature. It also has Pandora. So far I have no issues and are loving it!",5
0,"Bought this as a gift for my husband in less than. 6 months it broke twice , the first time it was replaced but took 10 business days & they said throw the face away the 2nd time they asked to send the watch in the mail & they will trouble shoot this could take 3 weeksVery disappointed in the service & this product will not buy anotherI purchased a Fitbit 3 a month ago but will not buy or Recommend this product",1
1,"I really like this Fitbit for all its features. However my charger quit working after only four months, so I had to buy a new charger.",5
1,"I’ve had a Fitbit since Fitbit came out and I can never resist getting the next latest Fitbit! The app is amazing and is honestly great with MyFitnessPal for an added bonus. I am probably one of fitbit biggest fans and promoters. I have tried Apple Watch 3 times and none have been anything like the Fitbit. Wel at least for fitness related stuff. I currently have the versa and love it. I love having my messages on mywatch, controlling music and the pay option is great. I also have ser real friends whom were strictly Apple Watch and I’ve switched them over to Fitbit to the most basic to the versa and they all love it as well",5
1,"What I like it interfaces with my IPhone seamlessly. I can see text messages and when my phone rings it will let me know who is calling me. What I do not like, I wish the battery life was more but for me personally I would like longer battery life for all my devices. The biometrics are excellent the heart rate and sleep score are especially useful.",5
1,"This replaces a Fitbit Blaze. Much better display, brighter, easier to read, comes on when I flick my wrist. Connects to my phone better. Smaller & sleeker than the Blaze. Water resistant. Battery lasts a week. The charger is still clunky, but I don't need to remove it from the band to put in the charger.",5
1,Great watch plus fitness tracker. Very customizable. Many band accessories available.,5
1,"Easy to set up. I love my fitbit. My only complaint is that u have to upgrade pandora in order to use it on the watch, which I did and it still didn't work. I bought headphones to listen to music and u have to have a computer in order to download music to the watch.",5
0,"I bought my Versa 2 in February, it finally got to me in March 2020. Barely 6-months in I am having to exchange the fitbit fortunately it's still covered by the warranty. However I have the added stress of mailing it to the USA and I live in Nigeria. I have used 4 fitbit devices in the past 5-years, and I am wondering if I am just unlucky. I will not be buying anymore devices from Fitbit. I will try a Samsung Watch or Apple watch going forward.",2
1,This is a great product! I would suggest this to anyone wanting to lose weight! It definitely motivates you! I love the sleep tracking. Accuracy on steps is like any other step counter (Are they really that accurate). But it makes me want to move more! I would recommend this for anyone!,5
1,"I love the Fitbit live of watches - especially the Versa 2. However, that is WHEN they work! I never know whether my Versa will be “found” or not...So sadly, I may have to try another brand for the sake of reliability.",3
1,"I was under the impression one could answer phone calls through this device. There is just an option to hang up, which is useful but not everything I expected. The voice to text only works half of the time, and the spotify app does not work or is hard to install. I can play music through it using the music note. This fitbit is pretty accurate when it comes to monitoring exercise and sleep, and is a great little gadget for monitoring apps. It's good, but not great or everything I hoped for.",4
1,"Got this for my mother in law and she loves it.. So if she is happy everyone is happy, need I say more.",5
1,"I love this watch, unfortunately, my first one lasted approximately 4 months replacement watch was only about 4 months and it stopped working! No clock display. It’s non-returnable now. I don’t shower or wash with it on.I’m so disappointed I had the Fitbit flex that lasted for years.It has a syncing problem but will sync eventually.Update: started working all on its own. another couple of months dead again......",3
1,"Counting staircases is a week point, seems to be somewhat ransom. Sometimes the device misses several flights of stairs, other times it records stairs when I was mostly walking on level ground. Generally though, it does seem to record my activity more correctly than my old HR2.",5
1,Got this for my husband around June 2020. Was working great and has had a fitbit before. Two days ago it stopped working and the screen went black. Tried resetting and it didn’t work. Very disappointed and do not know who to send to since I purchased off Amazon and the window to send back expired.,3
1,"Did I sleep before having a sleep tracker on my wrist every night? I don’t know, but my wrist was cold and unstylish.I love being able to monitor my sleep every day. I have heard the accuracy of these devices is questionable. I believe this is true as it also records lengthy periods of reclining.Nevertheless, it has given this light sleeper peace of mind.Bonus points for the limited edition styling.",5
0,I had to return it because it stopped connecting to my phone in less than a month. I also noticed that when I purchased brand new from another supplier outside of Amazon the set up was Slightly different many things from my Amazon purchase were already set up which led me to believe I may have received a refurbished watch. The box it came in was also different 🤷🏽‍♀️ the plus side was that I was able to return with no problem,2
0,They are working on fixing the connection issue with your phone and correct heart rate and steps but right now it seems the product was released too soon,1
0,Quit syncing to my smart phone. Customer service is no help.Tried everything to fix it.,1
1,"The features on this watch are very helpful from tracking what you eat, exercising, heartrate, sleep patterns and many more things I haven't used yet. It was a great buy !",5
1,Very satisfied with my purchase but i must say i dont need this watch for extreme things.,5
0,"The pandora never worked on my device. I tried getting support to help me but they weren’t very helpful. The gps tracker was off by a lot. I used it while simultaneously using the Nike app on my phone and they did not match. The steps were not always accurate either. I would be laying down and steps would be marked. If you need a smart watch, this is not worth the money. Better to spend the extra money and get an Apple Watch. I returned this product and got my money back.",1
1,"Very nice, its my first smart watch and I love it!! The set up took forever but didnt have any issues. I love that you can personalize everything from your info to the background, and that there are so many options for bands that you can buy separately!!",5
1,"My Versa 2 is incredible for 2 reasons: it keeps me moving all day - mostly about 15 k steps and the Fitbit app communicates to my Lose it App - giving me calorie credits. Secondly, when I have wandered away from my phone, the Versa will tell me who is calling and the opening line of a text. Great info!",5
0,I bought this for my wife for Christmas. What a mistake! Sleep tracking works one day out of five. Other functions are sporadic at best. Even updates are near impossible to complete. Don’t waste your money on Fitbit products. Buy an Apple Watch!,1
1,I purchased it to track physical activity and sleep activity. Does both very well. You are to double tap the face for the display to come on. I do have to tap it several times to get it to come up. I do with the battery would last a bit longer than just a few days.,4
0,"Loved it kept track of my steps, it's a great motivator.... Right up until it dies on you. 3 months!! That's it! 160.00 you'd think at least a year! One day it just wouldn't charge. No reboot nothing!",1
1,Great watch comfortable great at sleep tracking lasted 2 1/2 years,4
1,"Bought it back in 2020 for my dad. It help with his steps as he needed to stay healthy for his liver transplant. A year later the watch started to freeze and has a green screen. I’ve restarted it several times, changed the clock face and nothing. It was good for a year and I’m just upset that I paid this much for something that did not last more than a year.",4
1,"Upgraded from my Fitbit Versa, the Versa 2 is sleeker and looks better on the wrist.Alexa is easy to use and I LOVE the always on screen. Highly recommend for anyone looking to upgrade from a fitness tracker to a Smartwatch.",5
1,The step tracking has always been off a bit. But the stair tracking has completely stopped worked and the rest of the features are slowly stopping to work one at a time. Just disappointed all together in this product.,3
0,This Versa2 is the second device I bought from Fitbit. The first was an Ionic. Its battery died after a year and a half.The display on my Versa2 just died after only a year and 4 months. Both obviously were out of warranty. I like the functions and using the Fitbit but their durability is very questionable. I would not recommend any of their devices solely because they do not last.,2
0,Well. It arrived from Amazon with a broken seal. Motor was defective. Notifications did not work. Contacted FitBit who is sending me a replacement. SUPER disappointed in Amazon. I waited 3 weeks for this item and receive a previously opened or used device.,1
1,"I love this watch. Only problem is I tend to sleep with my arm under my head and it puts too much pressure on the watch wrist. So now I just rest without it. But it allows me to keep up with texts as a busy mom, while also allowing me to remain professional.",5
1,"This is a amazing watch. It has all the bells and whistles anyone would want. Definitely a must for someone wanting to track their fitness goals. Only down side, the band was difficult to change. Otherwise, completely happy with this product!",5
1,Gifted this. Price was lower than fitbit store's. It was shipped and delivered in a timely manner. Well liked by the recipient.,5
0,"Hr function does not work during weight lifting and high intensity workouts. Text messages do not come through. Battery does last me about 1 week, which is great. I bought one for my fiancee as well and her text messages come through, most of the time. Her hr monitor almost never works. Her sleep tracking does not work at all, and the battery life on hers is about half of mine. Consistency seems to be an issue with these Versa 2’s. I do not recommend purchasing one. We will be sending both back, unfortunately.",2
0,II have had multiple Fitbit devices; they tend to break and loose charge quickly. I switched to Garmin instinct.,2
0,The tracker doesn't accurately track mileage when logging an exercise like running or walking. It makes this tracker moot because that's it sole purpose. I'm very disappointed in the fact that it regularly losing connection and cannot receive texts or call alerts.,2
0,"I ordered the watch earlier this year (2021) and it has failed to come on at least twice, since I’ve had it. The first time, I charged, what should have been a watch at 60% to get it to turn on. This time, I’m unable to get it to come back on at all. This may not be the case with every watch of this model, but it has been and is my experience.",1
1,"I loved this watch when I first purchased it. After wearing it for appropriately 9 months, it suddenly won’t hold a charge. I’ll charge it to 100% and within a few hours, I get notified that the battery life is low. It now goes from 100% charged to completely dead in 4-5 hours😡",3
1,At this point in time the product does a good job with no issues. It was pretty easy to setup and get going.,4
1,"Bought this for my Girlfriend. This is an upgraded fit bit to what she had which she loves as well. This does more, it also has a larger face for easier reading. She loves it! Gave her other Fitbit to her daughter.",5
1,"The Versa2 provides many different clock faces to choose from so you can have a display that works best for you. I also bought a metal watch band which is stylish and easier to get on and off than the standard straps. The Versa2 has more features than I will likely use, so I can't comment on everything, but all the basic features seem to work the same as the Blaze. The Weather and Alexa features are probably the two new features that I will use.",5
0,"Almost NEVER EVER CONNECTS! Ughhhhh..... I am pretty advanced in smart watches, why I got this one is beyond me..... I think it was the price. If you don’t need to track on the app, it’s great, otherwise it’s just good for heart rate and 02 and that’s about it.",2
0,"Only lasted 13 months. Had a Fitbit One, Fitbit Charge2 and the Fitbit Versa 2. Two of the three only lasted a year. I’m done with paying so much $$$ for Fitbit.",2
0,Stopped being connected to my phone after 8 months. one month after the warranty ended. }:-(. Yesterday (Month 10) the screen turned white and the face came off. I really like the device too. Sad.,2
1,"Love the product and ease of use. Love Alexa compatibility and use with the smart light bulbs. So many positives.....but, one week later and the Fitbit is now 20 dollars cheaper and BJ's is offering it for 60 dollars cheaper. We all work hard for our money so it hurts that my only recourse would be to send it back and repurchase it, nope not an option.",5
1,"The Versa 2 has kept both my wife and I focused on going from 3 to 4 hours sleep to 6 to 7 hours sleep. We now get promps to hydrate, exercise, track our food intake.The phone now sends messages and calls to our watch. We can respond to the watch and verbally reply without typing. We love it. My pants size has gone from a 44 to 34.Thank you for changing our lives.",4
1,"The versa 2 replaces an earlier Fitbit tracker. Main objective was to have statistics on the ""home page"" as well as enhanced specific exercise tracking. Internet based features are redundant with other devices and not needed to basify my objectives",4
1,My husband didnt think he was getting a good nights sleep until we started tracking his sleep and he actually sleeps 8-9 hours a night. It was really disappointing when it quit tracking and it took me quite a bit of research and downloads to get it working again. Don't really know why it started working again but it i fine now. Lot's of great features,4
0,"Terrible product. I purchased this smart watch for its NFC and Bluetooth. However, Fitbit pay only supports a limited number of banks, so that was a bust. And the Bluetooth is not compatible with Alexa buds. I don't understand how a watch that can support bluetooth audio and a pair of bluetooth earbuds are incompatible. Especially, when they are both Alexa enabled. This isn't even to mention the sync issues with the app and update troubles. Do not buy this.",1
1,"I virtually never take it off. I love tracking my steps daily and my goal is 10,000 each day. I love when my watch vibrates and the colors light up to celebrate I’ve hit my goal!! Highly recommend and I bought the pink...",5
1,Love my Versa 2. It’s got all the features I want to stay on track. It’s comfortable. Love the sleep feature to remind me to start getting ready for bed. I plan on wearing this until it falls apart.,5
1,"It’s a great product, but a lot of time it’s just unnecessary. Do I really need it? I like the sleep study a good bit but I’m averse go items on my wrists and it’s not small, quite a bulky head, every time I wear it and use the computer there is quite the collision but I’ll continue on until I find something better",3
1,"I'm really loving the Fitbit Versa 2, but I'm having a skin reaction where it sits on my wrist. I have kept it dry, clean, and switched wrists, but the device is still leaving a ""burn"" on my wrist. I contacted Fitbit customer service; they sent me a prepaid shipping label to return the device and charging cable, and they will send me a new one under factory warranty. Hopefully the new one won't cause this reaction!Note: chatting with a Fitbit CSR was super easy; she was quick with her responses and seemed quite knowledgeable.",3
0,"Bought this watch on October 08th, 2020 and on January 23rd, 2021 it stopped working. January 23rd The watch stopped coming on only the logo will come up and then cut off, it was charged. After about two days it came back on ... two days later lines on the screen and no longer working.",1
0,"This is my 2nd Fitbit stopped working April 15 2020. The screen went black. I’ve reset it, changed chargers. Do not buy ! Fit it’s don’t last long.",1
1,"I love the Fitbit Versa 2! It does everything I wanted, so this one was bought for my daughter! She loves it! No negatives here!",5
1,"I love it! It inspires me to keep my exercise going... let’s me know when I’m in fat burning zone, cardio zone... let’s friends and I (with any version of Fitbit) do weekly or weekend or even daily completions to encourage each other.I love the sleep tracking... keeps me aware of more time needed and helps me to figure out, based on a good or not so good nights sleep, what I can do to improve my sleep by being aware of what I did to contribute to a good or not so good night.I’d buy it again in a smooth second. I sat my Apple Watch aside for this, quote honestly.",5
0,As soon as you get a new device. If you don't disconnect it you won't be able to connect a new device. Once I got a new phone I was unable to connect my new phone. I want my money back,1
0,I was very disappointed with this watch. Before buying it I suggest to look to see if your phone is compatible with the watch. I was unable to sync Bluetooth as my phone was not in the compatibility list. I have a Moto e5. Now I have to return it and look for a better smart watch...don’t waste your money if your phone is not compatible with this watch. 😒,1
1,"I am very pleased with my Fitbit Versa 2. I like being able to have a watch along with the fitness tracker as well. It makes it easy to keep track of what I am doing! By the way, I love the color too!",5
1,I had done a lot of research on what kind of smart watch/ fit bit to buy. This one was highly recommended. It was definitely worth the buy. I love my watch. Love how you can sync it with the app and keep track of steps and other health aspects.,5
1,"This product is ten times better than the older version. I love being able to rinse it off after usage, but of course all the wonderful usages of this watch. I love being able to change the face of the watch, the mass variety of workouts available, and all the other apps on this watch. Well worth it. 😊",5
0,"I have tried a variety of the FitBits. None have demonstrated durability. A couple of years ago, I used the Alta and had it replaced 3 times because it quit working. I gave up on them. Recently, I heard they had improved on the construction and they were much better. Just purchased a Versa 2 in July and have already had to send it back due to faulty construction. Waste of money....",1
1,Worked for 9 months. Sleep tracker was iffy and had a difficult time auto syncing. Then it just stopped. Tried to revive it using 2 different chargers. Really disappointed in this model.,3
1,"I have loved my fitbit since day one, but it somehow came undone and fell off of my wrist and now my screen is busted.... I can't even figure out how to go about replacing the screen and I'm pretty disappointed.",3
1,HORRIBLE!!!! Do NOT buy. I bought or in January of this year. Fitbit has had to send me a new one three times now. It keeps locking me out. These are the worst. It just stopped working after two months. So frustrating!,5
1,"It worked well for a few weeks and then it began acting up. Especially in the mornings, it would be unusable if I had it set so that it would wake when I moved my wrist to look at the time. It would randomly shut off or become unresponsive throughout the day. If you set it to only wake up when you press the side button it works fine, but that's annoying. It's a solid watch and I like it when it actually works.",3
1,"This was an upgrade for me from the Charge HR 2 that I had been using for years. Overall, its everything i wanted EXCEPT I chose music over GPS but the store music feature wont work.",4
1,"I like this watch, accessible to use, battery life works for four days, amazing!. And exercise program is easy to use, and the heart rate is excellent. I like to use the Snapchat avatar.",5
1,I like it. I dont like to wear things on my wrist so it has taken some getting used to. It is worth the investment. I use the app to track my food intake. Sometimes it's a bit off but I still love it.,5
1,Needs to be able to control Amazon Music... they already have a relationship (Alexa built in). Why doesn't it.While tracking workouts you can't do anything else on it (such as control music).Other than those items it's an awesome watch.,5
1,Love the watch but it DOES NOT have Gorilla Glass. Wearing for only a week and not banging it on anything it still has some slight scratches. Purchase a.screen protector.,5
0,I just got this watch a year ago and it already is broke. If you're going to get this watch make sure you get the warranty. I feel like I wasted $200.,1
1,"I love my watch so much, and didn’t realize how much I wanted this until my husband got it for me. This has so much motivation for me, I am obsessed with it and have not taken it off since. It tracks all of my steps, and if it over tracks, I recommend to put it on your left hand and put your settings to dominate. Or put it on the hand that you don’t use the most and then said it to dominant. It is truly one of the best gifts I’ve ever received!",5
0,I bought this for its sleep tracking feature. I wore it for 2 nights. I woke up after the second night and discovered that the screen was cracked and scratched. I was incredulous that a sportswatch was not more durable. I can't use it to track sleep because I'm afraid of further damage due to the fragility of the screen so it's useless to me. Would like to return it. No one told me that I would need to buy a protective cover for this watch to enable me to use all of its features without damaging it.,1
1,This was a gift for my husband and he absolutely loves it! It was a replacement for a Fitbit Charge 2 that he had worn for years. Can't say anything that he dislikes about this watch.,5
0,"I was hesitant to write a review simply because I don’t usually leave reviews, but here I am convinced that maybe I should because it might be helpful to anyone out there with sensitive skin. These pictures are the results of how the band affected my skin after exposing in water and wearing it. Terrible 😞 what is the silicone made out of. Highly disappointed",2
1,I wish it answered calls 📞 would be even better I guess I'll have to get the versa 3 for that,5
1,"I love this watch. Music, heart exercise and sleep monitors really helpful. Logging food with weight goal has kept me on track.",5
0,Battery will not keep charge for a day even when not in use,2
1,"I have tried a variety over pass 3 years. This one is the best so far. The sleep monitoring is my most valuable feature. The step count is accurate enough. The count puts your daily activities in perspective, allowing you to regulate healthy exercising.",5
0,"watch is great and enjoy it, issue is fibit app, i have another fitbit versa and the app, only allows 1 smart to track, so the new versa 2 steps etc are not counted or syn with my account..terrible tool and makes the versa 2 worthless as a tracker",2
1,"The Versa 2 works well, but it depends who’s your cellphone provider for the apps to work properly. Versa 2 was saying one thing about my steps and the cellphone had something totally different but all three of us disputed the stair climbing.",4
1,"No where in the advertisement did I see that I'd have to subscribe to ""premium"" to get the services I needed. This is a rip off.",3
1,"This is by far the best Fitbit that I have had. I am still learning how to use it bc none of my other fitbit had apps. I love being able to respond to texts, the wallet, listen to music via bluetooth and get the weather.",5
0,"Usual bad sync experiences like previous fitbit, but becomes really annoying.Alexa option never worked yet as you phone needs to be connected to it, app on the background, and probably venus Mars and mercury to be alligned!!No big apps on the store, no ability to reply to msgz, no apple music app ....",2
1,"Still trying to learn more about it. There must be a actory setting on that is only giving me (maybe) 2 days of battery life (besides always on display). Had a hard time getting it to take a charge initially too. I like keeping my purple band throughout my fitbit purchases, weird that it's a ""limited edition"".",3
0,I’ve worn a fit bit for years. Three different models. Bought this for my husband. He gets hundreds of steps sitting on the couch and the time is off. Reset the time after much research and now stuck in 24 hour mode. Too time consuming to set up and calibrate. It’s being returned.,1
0,I don’t recommend buying this. I had it for about a week and my frustration piqued when I realized that the only way to control your Spotify is to have a premium account. Interesting they don’t mention that in the description. Thumbs down!!!!,1
1,This is so much better than the first versa. Battery life is fantastic and the workout features are far better. Very happy with this purchase!,5
1,"There perfect for our work industry! Battery life is great, got screen protectors just in case, and overall an awesome watch.",5
1,"He only removes Fitbit Versa 2 when in the shower - and it is fully charged. He especially likes the health monitors. Setting everything was efficient. The weekly updates remind him of any accomplishments. As time goes by, he likes it more and more.",5
1,Just love it!! This is my 3rd Fitbit since 8 years ago and each time i upgrade I’m thrilled. Love this Fitbit and love that i can see my texts and calls on it as well.,5
1,I don’t find it easy to use. Battery life not great. It has taken me a while to figure it out. Not easy still can’t get music from SPOTIFY to download.,5
1,"It functions well, but battery life is much shorter than my previous model. I appreciate the stair tracker.",4
0,"Software breaks - Bluetooth connection working fine. Stopped working today and seems to happen to other people for, like a year, and Fitbit does not give a crap. They will tell you to restart/reinstall/redo everything..... Like that is workable on a daily basis. I have the old Fitbit never had a problem, I am so disappointed in this purchase.",1
1,"So easy to set up and figure out how to use. Literally one of the best purchases I’ve ever made! Just knowing my sleep patterns has been super helpful. But I absolutely LOVE this, and in one week I lost 5lbs. It’s VERY motivational!!!",5
0,"It only works if you don't sweat. I do crossfit and I have to constantly wipe my arm off and the sensors in the middle of a WOD, but it only fixes it for a minute. It's inconsistent with sleep tracking too. This is not for serious athletes.",2
0,"The time keeps going back to military time, I set it back and it then goes back to military time again. It also jumps from Easter time to central time on it's own. The Versa 2 worked well the 1st month but is now not even reliable for a watch.",2
1,Had a charge2 for 6 years. Cracked screen. Bought Versa2 as more affordable. Happy with it thus far.,5
1,I really like this watch BUT it is very inconsistent! Sometimes it will notify me of text messages from my phone or emails but not consistently. It might vibrate for a text one minute and then next minute it will completely miss another text or email. Quite annoying. I’ve tried the trouble shooting but it hasn’t foxed the problem. The step counter seems accurate and the sleep tracker as well. Disappointed with the lack of consistency though.,3
1,"This fit bit is awesome, just Love it! My first fitbit was hard for me to read in the dark, not this one and it even has Color!! Not to mention far more attractive!!! Love it, would highly recommend!!",5
1,I wish I can see the percentage charge left on the device. I need to go to the application to find out. My previous Fitbit had right at front.,5
1,"I like the watch however, when I turn my wrist to see the time it does not work. I have to push the button and if your hands are full you can't get at it. Also I purchased the copper color and you can't find bands that match the copper color only the rose color.The Fitbit app does not sync unless you go into the app and refresh it. I deleted the app and downloaded a new one but the same thing happens.",3
1,My daughter really enjoyed The Versa 2 but thought for the price battery would last longer than 20 months.She uses to track her swim distances and calorie burn.Thinking about an Apple product.,3
1,"I really like this product! very easy to maintain and it tracks so much! With this, I can know to track my steps, heart rate, and sleep! It is so useful for my everyday life as a college student! and it comes with two sizes to help you get the perfect fit!",5
1,The glass cracked after I'd had it a month. And then it died while I was swimming. A more crack resistent glass would be a help.,3
1,"Seriously look how snatched this looks. Super soft, great display and the approximate are great plus as well. Highly recommend this watch.",5
1,"This is my 3rd Fitbit, enjoy the ease of set up, love the customer service. My previous watches had to be charged every4 or 5 days. This one only lasts 3, wondering what the difference is!?",5
1,"Best present I got this Christmas. Asked my honey for one and I love it. I haven't used all of the features yet, but so far it suits my wants/needs just fine.",5
1,I've had no issues with it since I got it. Love all it us capable of doing.,5
1,Bought for husband. He is very pleased. Display is great. Gives home the information he wanted to control his health,5
0,Bought in March and it just stopped working can get hold of supplier! I am furious!!!!! DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SUPPLIER!!!!!!,1
1,John is obsessed with this thing. He was dieting but now he is committed. He was worried he would forever be a yo-yo dieter but now he thinks he can use it to diet in a more balanced way and then maintain a healthy lifestyle while using it.,5
1,"I like the watch, it is comfortable to wear the all day and even to sleep with it. However, since I bought I've faced already two issues. The first one was the band came with a cut, then I contacted the Fitbit and they sent a new one. And, now I have another issue the screen has not swiping, and this is happening for the second time in less than a week. I just contacted the Fitbit again, and I hope they fix that issue as well. I hope I won't have more problems. It is very frustrating. (Angelica)",3
0,"This is the 2nd Fitbit in less than a year, the first one just quit working after several months, will not turn on or charge. This on the heart monitor quit working in less than a week, also the sleep monitor doesn’t work well either.

Fitbit already has pebble company.I also used pebble time for 4 years. Pebble never lost notifications.Why fitbit try to solve their terrible mobile app?I can't recommend nobody until update their app perfectly.Good devices! super bad apps!",2
1,The Fitbit Versa 2 has every feature you need in a health/exercise tracking watch. You don't need to empty your wallet or bank account to buy this watch. My wife enjoys hers. She bought hers two years ago.,5
1,"Only had one year and heart tracker is broken. The sensor stopped working. Pretty important feature. I've tried factory reset, toggling settings etc. Pretty disappointed. Other than that, works fine.",3
1,"Overall love the product, this is the 2nd one I’ve owned (lost the first one at the beach.). This one does not stay charged, must be recharged every day. Very inconvenient.I would have rated it a 5 except for the battery, which is a big deal.",3
1,The Fitbit Versa 2 Special Addition is awesome it works great with your mobile app and it keeps accurate sleeping time. Love the smart features. Love the cell phone finder if you misplace your phone. This is a awesome Fit Bit!,5
1,"a good watch with good tracking of heartbeat and sleepingbut some function needs to pay, this is not very reasonable. on the other side, the battery is not that long as it said.",3
1,"I got this watch on 10/6/2029 , everything else works fine and I love it , but somehow my wrist skin gets some sort of peeling , has been like this for few days . I guess If you have sensitive skin you should purchase a separate breathable band along with this watch",4
1,"I really enjoy this. Features may seem simple and basic, but has all of the necessary ones. Big but not too big. Very nice bright screen, which can be seen even in direct sunlight.",5
1,Update on my review it is an excellent watch it was my bat didn't set it up correctly that's why i had only 1 star earlierEverything works great plenty of clock face.Highly recommended it to everyone.,5
1,Serves my purpose of keeping track of steps. Pretty and comfortable. I do find that locating cell phone does not always work. :(,5
1,"Love the color, love the tracking! I turned off all the notifications because I don’t need any more stress in my life, I was just looking to track my fitness and it is doing a great job!",5
1,I love the watch. Viewing messages and phone calls on my watch is a plus. Screen very easy to read. Only complaint is that recording my sleep is sporadic.,4
0,"I'm very disappointed in this product. For about a month (right after return period was over), it started not holding the charge for more than a couple of days. You have to try multiple times to swipe the screen. Something you have to turn it on and off before the swipe works. While the concept is good, i wouldn't buy this product again. For $150 plus tax, you should get something better than this for your money.",1
1,"The shipping took WAY longer than expected, but once I received it in the mail I fell in love with it. It does have certain things I wish were better, but nobody is perfect. It does track sleep incredibly and tells you exactly how long you were in light sleep, deep sleep, REM sleep, and how long and how often you woke up through the night!Over all I highly recommend this product, but maybe buy it in store if possible.",5
0,"Heart rate monitoring stopped about 2 months after purchase. Can't get the screen to always come on when pressing button, and have to deal with a black screen. Screen is prone to freezing and ignoring all touch inputs for periods of time. All of this is without having ever trying this device in water.I am so very disappointed with this purchase.",1
1,"Worked great for about 6 months and then it quit. Screen is just ""crazy lines"" now.",3
1,I like everything about the watch except the wrist band. My honest opinion is buy a more durable wrist band as soon as you can. The original breaks to easy.,5
1,This works great except for pairing with notifications. There is a glitch with the Apple phone and you don’t receive notifications of texts.,4
1,Very happy with my purchase. The larger face allows me to see the clock as well as the other screens clearly. I was not able to do so on my charge three.,5
1,Have been using it for over a month for an intense biking regimen. Does everything I need it to do. Had a previous version for three years. Still working just fine. Gave to a friend.,5
0,"Upgraded to newest version, but will not sync to my phone. Customer support is useless, was told to buy new phone since it does not work with Android OS 10 and that they could not assist.",1
0,"Versa 2 has all sorts of issues - it won't stay charged and the touch doesn't work. Support for the product is ""meh"". I chatted with Fitbit and was told to send them a video of ""swiping"" to demonstrate that touch wasn't working. Sent the video and have heard NOTHING.I would not recommend Versa 2 - it doesn't deliver on the features promised.",1
0,I really wanted to like this watch as I have been a huge fan of Fitbit in the past. This particular model just isn’t good enough. Bluetooth disconnects on its own. I wasn’t able to access Spotify or read my messages.,2
1,I love the fit bit activity tracker. Easy to set up and it performed exactly as described. However I recently developed open wounds underneath the face not the band and had to stop wearing it on my wrist.,3
1,"I like the fact that the Versa 2 can track my oxygen at night while I sleep. I can swim and shower with it. The Alexa is helpful and the ""find my phone"" part works better than standard Versa. Very happy with my purchase.",5
0,Stay far away! They designed this to only work with a few select phones. The list of fully compatible phones is short. It's sad that my old basic Inspire could get notifications but this brand new product of theirs cannot. Tech support no help either.,1
1,I love the watch. The face is bigger than most Fitbits. The only problem is that less than a year in and the watch is no longer holding a charge. Not sure if it's just this one or if there is some sort of defect.,5
1,"Not having had a smart watch before, I have nothing to compare it to be so far I like it.",5
0,"I love my Versa 2 .... till it stops!😡 It seems to quit working about every 5 months. It will charge to 100% and then dies 4 hours later. This has happened to me twice in the last 12 months. If it’s under the one year warranty they will will replace the watch( not the band). If it’s over the 12 month period, you are screwed.",2
0,Very comfortable to wear. My only issue is that it came with 1 dead pixel in the middle of the face. Very annoying when you spend money and that comes that way but it's annoying to go through the return process and wait for the replacement to arrive.,1
0,Quit working after 1 year! Both me and my husbands! Mine started working but now loses charge really fast! I wasted $300 on these!,1
0,"At first, I loved this watch. Has some bells and whistles - just perfect for the few things I wanted in a watch (viewing text messages, time, heart rate, stop watch). However, after just 6 months, the watch is beginning to die. The battery life lasts less than a day. The touch screen only works half the time. Disappointed in the life of the watch.",2
1,I thought of the Apple Watch but this does everything I need. For 1:2 price. And cute too,5
1,"My wife's been using this since it was release a week or so ago and loves it so far. Just wish the charger was a bit more convenient to use. The cable comes out of the center of the back so you really can't sit it someplace, it just kinda has to lay there.",5
1,Like the sleep tracker and the steps counter seems to be accurate!,5
1,I love the different watch faces I can use and the step tracking. By far my favorite Fitbit I’ve had.,5
0,Not thrilled. I replaced a Blaze with this Versa. Several connectivity issues. The Blaze was rock solid and this not so much. The Alexa feature is a joke. Update; have had this Fitbit for 2 months now. Connectivity issues ongoing. And today the face of the watch fell out of the socket. I feel beyond ripped off.,1
0,"The fitbit versa was amzing, my favorite. Unfortunately it died on me after 3 years. So i bought the fitbit versa 2..... horrible! Battery dies after 2 days, it litterally burned my skin, and it does not notify me when a text or call comes in. I have teied every setting in the book and had other people tey and help me...nothing. I DO NOT RECOMMEND PPL TO BUY THIS!",1
0,"Purchased for its advertised sleep tracking, specifically a display of percentage of time within each SLEEP STAGE. IT NEVER WORKED. Talked with several different customer support people, and implemented all their instructions, but NoJoy: The last one advised me to return it for a refund, before the return period ended. Conclusion: This device is pretty, with great advertising, and good tech. support, and impressive array of functions, BUT the sleep tracking/analysis/display function is NOT READY FOR PRIME TIME.",1
0,"The media could not be loaded.
 At the flip of the wrist the tome is supposed to be displayed see the video for exactly what happens. This jus happened after Jan 2022. I would like to receive a replacement.",1
0,Help please. Has anyone elae had this issue with the bamds? Im not allergic to anything and have never had this happen before. I tried to get in touch with the company but it is like jumping through hoops!,2
1,Wasn’t sure if I’d like this now I feel naked without it ..I love all the tracking and enhanced features and it’s surprising very comfortable....one charge and the battery lasts for days,4
1,got this for my wife for Christmas because she had a Fitbit zip we're having issues with the zip downloading so I bought her the Bursa to seems to work pretty well I haven't had any problems with her telling me this doesn't work or that doesn't work so yes it was a good purchase,5
0,First one did work. Called fitbit they replaced. Have had nothing but problems. Have spent all kinds of time with fit because the phone will not sync to the watch phone states it's pared. Won't update.,2
0,"This product won't sync. Researched the forums, tried options provided to fix the problem. None work. Don't waste your money on this Fitbit. It's prone to problems. Just Google Versa2 ""no device found"" and see for yourself.",1
1,Absolutely love this watch!!! I would highly recommend it to every one!!! Love the alexa I use her alot for grocery lists. (I'm good at writing them and leaving them on the counter) love keeping track of my hear rate and the friendly competitions with family members.,5
1,"Loved at first. Although maybe I got a defective one, the battery life only last on mine maybe 2 days and then needs to be charged. When advertised it says 6+ days.",3
0,"Apps are ok, not convinced the monitors are all that accurate. Most disappointing, not swim proof. Lasted just barely over a year.",1
1,"this watch does have syncing/Bluetooth connection issues regularly, which is unfortunate as it is the main reason I bought this watch. Its nice for the fitness side of things but to use it for text message response/ call response (it only works about half the time). At least once a week I have to restart the devise and my phone to reset everything and turn on/off Bluetooth to get it to re sync.",3
1,"Absolutely drop dead darling!!!I was afraid it would look to big , my wrist is really tiny, but it looks super cute! It’s very feminine and does all the cool things. Even if it did nothing but tell time it’s a keeper!!",5
1,"I just received the new Fitbit Versa 2 and just love it. I find myself wearing it all the time, even to work, workouts, leisure, & sleep. The app is really great - giving you a plethora of information and the ability to customize your Fitbit.",5
1,IMHO hard to set up. I like the size of the face though. Can't tell time which is kind of a deal breaker :)I would not recommend it.,3
1,Bought this for my mom as a gift for her birthday and she loved it a d works great,5
1,I thoroughly enjoy this! It's been helping motivate me and keep me on my feet! The different face you can choose are awesome! Im glad I bought this! It's everything I expected it to be and more!,5
0,"Worked fine (app is a pain but functional, limited features) until just after the one year warranty expired. Then they sent out an update that made the battery life hours instead of days and all measurements inaccurate. Their customer support answer was, you can have a small discount on a new one. So in other words, don't spend the money unless it's worth it to you too have a mediocre product for only the length of the warranty.",1
0,"Band broke, tried multiple bands but never got them to fit. Also, to pay $100+ for something that tells you that you are burning 10x the cal that you actually are helps no one. Save your money and buy any of the $30 knockoffs that will do the same as this.",1
0,"It's been 5 years since I last bought a Fitbit, and it hasn't gotten better. The sleep monitor doesn't accurately track my hours, and the step/stair counter is terrible. While driving my truck for an hour I've claimed 25 flights of stairs, and walked 2000 steps?",2
1,The shipping was great. Package came actually early so there is no complaints in that department. The item fits great and will order from them a lot more.,5
1,"I LOVED Fitbit and have worn them for many years. I recently got a tattoo on my wrist. Fitbit does not pick up on heart rate through tattoos. I should have done my research since this is a common issue. All I have is a fancy pedometer at this point :/ soo warning if you have tattoos where you will wear this, DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY. It doesn’t track my heart rate, sleep, workout, nothing :/",3
1,"I love my Versa 2. I upgraded to the 2, and I really like the Alexa option. I still wish I could text from it, but I have an iPhone.I know there’s so much more that I can do with it, still learning.I love the color of the band. Something other than the plain black that I had.",5
1,"Sleep doesn't show until after midnight. If I go to bed at 10, it doesn't count that first 1.5 hours.",4
0,"After the firmware update last week, the fitbit versa 2 isn't tracking hear rate accurately, or active zone minutes. Customer service was unhelpful, indicating that I'm just wearing it wrong. I've had it just over a year (out of warranty by one month) with no issues until the firmware update. Beyond frustrated as I really loved my fitbit up until now, and will never buy another due to the horrible customer service.",1
1,"Extremely pleased with my fitbit versa 2! Tracks my running, steps, sleep,and many more things. I also love that I recieve all of my texts, emails, and phone calls on it and can send some replies without having to stop what I am doing and get my phone.",5
0,"It will not sync correctly. I've went to the support groups, tried everything. It will not work correctly. I HATE IT. I LOVED my Charge 2. It worked GREAT for years, never a problem. But this Versa is TRASH. I'm so disappointed.",1
1,"I love this watch and would give it a much higher rating if one of the music apps was Amazon Music. The watch is Alexa enabled, but you can't use Amazon Music. You can use Spotify but not Amazon Music. While I am sure this is financially driven, it's maddening",3
1,"Mostly accurate: accurate for weights, but not so much for indoor cycling (Spinning). Other than that I LOVE IT!",4
1,"This is my fourth model of FitBit, most recently replacing a first generation Versa. I like the functionality, but wish they could figure out how to track steps while pushing a shopping cart. I'm very glad they made it compatible with bands for the old Versa, as I had to switch to my special edition woven band for my old Versa. The new band made the skin on my wrist peel.",4
0,"I'm returning this watch because either there's something wrong with the battery or it's not what they say. I don't use hardly anything on the watch and started with lasting 3 days, now it only lasts ONE day....it's ridiculous",1
0,"Don’t buy this product. I had problems with a previous version and wanted to give the company another chance but it’s not good. It won’t connect to my WiFi. Went through all the manual steps but it won’t connect. I’m not wasting time anymore. This is such a basic issue. If this isn’t right, I’m not going to wait for other issues. This is anti fitness.",1
1,It eas very easy to set up. I can swim and sleep while wearing,5
1,"I really like this product! I really enjoy the myriad of clock faces that I can choose from, and am pleasantly surprised with the data that it seems to gather. The battery isn't GREAT but works, and am impressed with the sleep data.The strap quality is terrible however. The strap that broke wasn't the one they expect you to swap for differing wrist sizes - it was the strap with the buckle. Now the watch is useless until I can figure out a way to attach it to my wrist securly. :(",3
0,Have to constantly reset it fir it to work now. Second Versa. I’m about over Fitbit.,2
1,like I said I buy it for my wife have a little trouble getting the app working properly on Android most of the time not working for the price is too much for having a clockand a Pacer,3
0,Can’t say anything nice at this time because it only works half the time. Could be me having trouble,1
0,"App hardly ever syncs with the phone. Alexa doesn't text or play music she pretty much only does reminders and basic things. In addition, when I started an exercise, it hangs because it again will not sync with the phone unless I open up the app and tell it to. Pretty much worthless",1
0,"The steps and calories are EXTREMELY inaccurate. It's over counting, even on my non-dominant arm, and saying I am an outrageous amount of calories under budget. I would gain so much weight back if I listened to that! I am returning it as it's not worth $200 when it's hardly even a smart watch. The Alexa takes a while to ""think"" and, almost every time, doesn't understand me.. no matter how well clearly I annunciate.",2
1,It says it's good for 50 meters but mine has water inside of it now after wearing in the pool and it does not work...I obviously like it enough that I'm buying it again. I just won't wear in the pool.,5
0,I love the features but I am constantly having to unpair and re-pair it. There are also times that I have to restart my phone to make it sync. Especially after it's charged.,2
1,"I’ve always loved Fitbit! I got the new Versa hoping that it worked with the new upgrade and I could finally get text notifications. Turns out it doesn’t, and I never should have bought a new one because the Alexa doesn’t seem to sync either. So the new features are basically pointless. Other than that, Fitbit is great and I love the app.",3
1,I use it to keep track of my sleep and breathing,5
0,Es un verdadero problema configurar los servicios de comunicación teléfono-reloj. Hasta ahora no puedo compartir música y contactos para llamadas.,1
1,Have the first APPLE WATCH did not want to spend another five hundred on a watch just to be able to swim in. Great alternative!,5
0,"Bought in November to replace the versa I got for mother's day in May that broke, now for the last month with this one it doesn't get notifications anymore. Getting pretty fed up. Thinking of changing to Samsung if I can get my money back.",2
0,I did not have this watch a year yet and the face of it came off-I really like the watch until then. Thank goodness I purchased insurance now I need to see if they will fix it.,2
0,Gave me an awful mark on my skin and I had to stop wearing it for a month for it to go away. It’s now been almost 4 months and I can see weird loss of pigment where it was. Now it won’t charge or turn back on. What a waste of money. Do not buy.,2
1,"Versa 2. Helps me stay on track with steps , sleep and etc. just wish I could answer texts with Alexa",5
1,"Since receiving my Versa 2, I am making sure I get all my steps in and then some. Have really enjoyed the sleep pattern monitor, as it shows how I need to improve my sleep habits.It has stood up to the test of working out in the garden, getting hot and sweaty, and never stopping.I like the reminders to get up and move to help me keep the steps going, during the day.Over all I am very, very pleased with the device.",5
1,"Only CON? Please for the love of all things holy-- get a new band. The silicon is so rough on the skin. It will look disgusting require constant cleaning and it will make your skin irritated, hair fall out, chafing, rashes etc",5
1,Can’t always see the time unless I tap the side.In my job it’s important to always see the time.. I don’t feel it’s accurate. I’m actually disappointed . I had a Garman before and loved it.. I have only used it for three months.. maybe the longer I have it I will like it better..,3
1,"Really love the product and the app but after a month or so it got a little glitchy. Customer support helped me reset it but the touchscreen still only works about half the time. Even with the touchscreen issue though, I still love it! It paired well with my phone (iOS). The sleep tracking is really good and the workouts that play from your watch screen are great.",4
1,On 2/21/21 while using my Sunny Cycle Bike I notice the face of my Versa2 Fitbit Watch just hanging open from the unit I was shock because I never expected this to happen. I need to know if I can get a replacement Versa? Please email me with an answer. Thank you.,5
0,This probably the worst thing I have ever purchased! Customer service is awful. Problems remain unresolved. Set up with customer service and still doesn't work. Love the style but no sense wearing it because it doesn't work!,1
0,The watch disconnects from my phone frequently. I have to restart the watch to pair it with my phone. At times I have to erase the versa from my phone and reconnect it all over. I own fossil smart watches and never have any connection issues. Would not recommend this watch..,1
1,"I love the Vera 2. I the love the tracking feature, the sleep and the activity feature. The charger seems to be faster on this model than the other Versa I had. I really like the calls and messages. It a great fitness tracker.",5
0,"The media could not be loaded.
 So I bought this Fitbit just over a year ago and I was walking around the house yesterday when I noticed the screen like this, which is really sad because I will not buy one every year and I am finding that a lot of people have had this problem!This is unfortunate because I love Fitbit but I cannot afford to buy one every year",1
1,"I bought this item hoping it would result in change in healthy habits, and it did. I developed a friendship with this in-animate object, it congratulates me when I meet my health objectives and reminds me when I am not. In a way it is ""big brother"" on my wrist!!",5
0,I bought it mainly to track my health but it has hands free payment methods which is another main reason for getting it. Well they don’t support my bank card. And if u thought it would be nice to to control your apps from your watch u better have the premium membership with the apps. Otherwise does a great job tracking my health data. But Will be returning for an Apple Watch. Trust me this is not worth the money!!!,2
1,The fit bit looks great and I really like it.... except it won't sync with my phone to show calls/texts. That is disappointing.,4
0,2nd watch band didn't fit....nor did 3 others we ordered separately.,1
1,I like the watch. It unfortunately does not count steps correctly. It consistently counts steps when I am sitting still. Also I have to sync my phone all the time manually.,4
0,"ALL OF MY OTHER FITBIT PRODUCTS LASTED YEARS, THIS ONE STOPPED WORKING AT EIGHT MONTHS. I THOUGHT IT WAS THE CHARGER AND PURCHASED A REPLACEMENT BUT IT STILL ISNT WORKING. SUPER DISAPPOINTING.",1
1,"I love the Fitbit Versa 2. This watch has managed to get me to keep up with my food. It has a fantastic barcode scanner that you can use to enter your food. I really, really love this watch.",5
1,"I initially was moving towards purchasing the iWatch. After comparing the two I began to lean towards the Fitbit Versa2. What finally got my attention was the attention to fitness, as well as the ALEXA connectivity. I am so please with my choice and look forward to becoming a healthier me - with the stats that are available at a glance.I am very happy with my purchase and the additional gems that this tracker provides.",5
0,"I really wanted to like this watch but unfortunately it kept getting disconnected from my phone. I tried resetting and updating multiple times and the watch just wouldn't stay connected. Watched a bunch of videos on how to troubleshoot but still nothing. In the end, i decided to return the watch.",1
0,"Will never buy another fitbit product. Have had 3 different fitbits in the past & never had a product with the battery. This new Versa 2 watch only lasts 3 days and 1 hour. Know the exact time because I had to do a battery check with fitbit. Was told if the battery lasted more than 3 days it was considered normal. That is not how they advertise this watch. They say can last 6 days between charging. Not even close. Asked fitbit if I could exchange it and they said no. Not good customer service, Very disappointed",1
0,I recently purchased a fitbit versa 2 and wore it for a few weeks. I have noticed that the sensors seem to be burning my skin and left scars on my wrist even after weeks of not wearing the watch. I would like a refund for this product as I will never wear it again and could potentially be dangerous as its left permanent marks on my skin. See pictures. Thank you,1
0,Watch loses the battery sometimes in less than a day. Other times the watch stops working and I have to reboot it. I haven't had time to call Fitbit to get help in trying to fix the issue. I probably have reset the watch 6 times since I bought it and it will work for a little while and then stop working. Luckily I bought a warranty with the purchase.,1
0,"I bought versa 2 on July 2020, but it completely stopped working after 10 months. The same thing happened with my Ionic a year ago. So I contacted Fitbit and they told me to ship my Fitbit back for replacement and I did. It has been 3 weeks but I got none, not even email notification. Based on my experience I concluded that buying Fitbit means renting watch for 10 months.",1
0,Not reliable. Green screen after a year and unable to fix.,1
1,I purchased for my husband and now I want to update mine.,5
0,"The watch is fine. I can get about 5 days without needing to charge which I think is somewhat reasonable.The bad sucks. I've worn watches with metal or rubber bands for most of my life and this is the only one that has caused my skin to break out multiple times. Thats completely unacceptable, especially at this price point.",2
1,"I use this mostly for steps and heart rate, although it can do so much more. It’s easy to read even in sunlight.",5
1,Battery life is extended at least one whole day,5
1,"There isn't one bad thing that I can say about this, I charge the battery maybe once every 5 days or so, text and phone calls cones through clearly, I'm still in the learning stages about the other apps that are one the phone, and I'll get the hang of it, but honestly this was an amazing purchase,",5
0,"Very slow recharging. I have to clean contact with alcohol, but still very slow. If I accidently charge it to 100%, it reverts to near zero and I have to start over",2
0,It was fine until it stopped working after 3 weeks.,1
1,"I have been using the Versa 2 for three weeks and was a great upgrade from my Charge 2. The Charge 2 was a really good fitness tracker, but I like the additional features on the Versa 2. I have only scratched the surface on all it's capabilities, but really love everything I have been trying.",5
1,Buen reloj ⌚cumple bien sus características único problema es la duración de la batería es muy corta solo dos días dura y luego hay que cargarlo ese su único problema,5
1,Wish it worked longer. Completely pooped after a year of use. Would not recommend for that price.,3
0,This watch is not user-friendly and is super complicated to use. The display cannot be accessed easily and between the login and google trying to overtake your life...I will not recommend it at all. All the apps they want you to use cost money and basically I do not need another job in my life trying to figure this out.,1
1,I like the way it keeps track of my heart rate as I sleep. Having had an A-Fib this is important to me. I also like that you can set it to remind you to keep moving. Being able to talk to Alexa is a plus,5
1,"Great quality and works well, no problems . .",5
0,Had difficulty trying to connect to my husband's Android. Thought it was due to his older version phone. He has a new phone and still not synching. The fitbit is stuck on the Logo screen and will not continue. This clearly arrived faulty - not even two months old. Never used and cannot return.,1
1,"I love this watch!!! I can get grouchy when I get a new phone or any new to me tech. Not so with this. Easy to set up, love poking around and I am so impressed with all it can do. My only regret is not getting it sooner!",5
1,"Easy to learn and use and the features are great sinking with my phone. This is my 2nd Fibit, I broke the first one which was a Fitbit versa 3. D not notice any difference in my needs with having the Versa 2, glad I got it and way cheaper.",5
1,Wife is happy with this one. Exactly what we were looking for.,5
1,"It would be perfect except for the vibration issue. It works 80% of the time, but 20% of the time no.",3
1,I love it! It was alittle hard to set up with my Samsung Galaxy s9 at first but after I figured it out I'd have to say it's one of the best fitbits I've ever owned! Very pleased with my order and highly recommend.,5
1,"I love it as a smart watch, and it’s got better battery life than I saw in my Apple Watch. Only problem I see is that I can’t use my iconic while this one is charging, so I can continue with my walking and sleep tracki",5
0,This watch does everything other than being able to track the most basic thing it is supposed to do. Lots of bells and whistles. I measured the HR against a few accurate devices and its way off. Don’t waste your money.,2
1,"Not many improvements from Fitbit Versa 1, the alexa feature is pretty useless and most of the apps needs to be Premium member to be able to use them plus the updated burlón system sucks....i loved fitbit but this new versa is really not impressive",3
1,I had the fitbit ionic for 4 yrs before this. It was a great change too as the layout and apps in it were exactly the same. Changing out the bands is easy. Changing the apps in it is easy. Getting to everything is easy. Love it.,5
1,Still learning the quirks of this new FITBIT.Wish battery life lasted longer.,5
0,I just received this Thursday and drove to my daughter's house 2 hrs away and it added 500 steps! Seems pointless if I can drive around all day and get steps counted.I also bought the 2 yr protection plan. Neither fitbit or square will help. One just tells me to contact the other. Rip-off scheme.,1
1,"Fiance loves all that it can track and do. My only problem with this is that Amazon has their own music app that this Amazon exclusive product does not support. Seems stupid, but they could potentially support it at one point.",4
1,Really like the watch. It does what I need and has not stoped working like some of the other cheap watches that I have purchased.,5
1,"Very helpful health tool. Helps track sleeping patterns and daily activities. If I receive a text or call, a quick glance at my watch tells me what I need to know.It’s a good size. Not too big or small.Still to new to know how accurate it is",5
1,"I really like this fitbit product, it keeps me active and there are so many cool features on the watch and in the app",5
1,Product might be good but it does not connect with my phone so I have to return it.......make sure you check phone compatibility before buying as most phones are not supported........Amazon was best to keep it's promise to deliver product next day.,3
1,"I've had this fitbit charge 2 for about 12 weeks. After 8 weeks the charger stopped working. It is my 3rd or 4th fitbit. Generally I like fitbits and their utility, but have found them not to be very reliable. I am currently wearing a backup fitbit that keeps time and tracks steps, it no longer notifies me of phone calls or text messages. Be careful this purchase. I bought a new charger and now the Fitbit is fine.",5
0,"It worked great when I first got it. The charger has never worked correctly and it's hard to charge. It was connected to my phone and it worked great for about 9 months. Now it won't connect to my phone. I got it new one not a refurbished, wish I would have stuck with my old knock off.",2
1,I have this fitbit and bought this item for a friend. I was disappointed to hear it does not have full functionality with her iPhone.Otherwise great!!! She still loves it.,5
0,I bought this watch to sync with my weight watchers app. I noticed it was not downloading the correct amount of steps onto the Fitbit app. Several times it was over 3000 steps less than what the watch had counted. I also found the watch uncomfortable to wear.,1
0,"I deeply regret buying this. It's difficult to get it to display the time (I had to tap it several times to get it to show me what time it was), the steps are not correct. I feel I totally wasted my money.",1
1,"I had the Fitbit Charge2 prior to this, so I would consider this an upgrade! I love it.. It tracks everything the previous Fitbit did and seems much more accurate. I didn't have all the troubles with adding it to my app like I have seen on several other reviews. The setup process was easy and I love the ability to add different clocks and the use of other apps on it. Very satisfied.",5
1,Not sure why but it doesn't want to sync properly. constantly having to turn it off and on again.,3
0,This is my 2nd fitbit..this is a horrible product they last more than a year. Don't waste your money..buy apple watch instead..,2
1,I like the fitbit all but the band it will not stay closed. then hang in or on everthing. If they correct this I would reall love it. I have a charget 2 and I like it better. Have no problem with the band,4
1,"Love these wash cloths, quick absorbing and dry quickly. Will order more.",5
1,"Still new enough still learning functions, but not disappointed yet.",5
1,"Battery seems to die a bit quicker than my Versa 1 did. Don’t get much use out of the Alexa feature as Siri on my iPhone seems to dominate that category. Wish this watch had the wallow talkie compatibility or speak to text feature. Text message notifications do not come up on my watch even though that setting is turned on and my phone is up to date. Experienced that same issue with my Versa 1. Overall I like the watch a lot, wear it everyday and think it looks great.",4
1,I use it everyday. Mainly wanted it as to calculate my steps and sleep. It does well. Charge stays longer then the inspire too. You can also link your messages to it.,5
0,This product started out good but we have had them a couple of months my wife’s stopped tracking heart beat very well and mine keeps alerting and vibration all night waking me up. I have tried to reset both nothing works right now. I would not recommend these watches spend the money for the apple watches.,1
1,"I have not updated to premium, so it is free to use. I use it mainly for steps, excercise and calorie burning tracking. Tells the time and date which I love. Perfect for me.",5
0,"The Fitbit Versa 2 does not properly sync to your phone and does not pick up an accurate step count. It does not link to other apps I have already paid for with exercise and food, so I’m basically tracking my fertility, calories, and exercise on other apps. Also any exercise you do you have to stop and go through the phone to tell it what you’re doing. It doesn’t pick up that your swimming or jogging or doing cardio. Besides that, I had to order it twice because the first time it was “delivered” there was nothing at my house and nobody on my camera delivering it.",2
0,I work the same job and do the same task every day. Except weekends. My zone minutes some days are 0. If and when this fit bit goes out. I will more than likely buy a Apple Watch.,1
1,The Versa 2 still has issues connecting to WiFi. Updates via Bluetooth are slow as expected. Functions as expected. Battery holds charge for 7 days. I have used previous models for four years.,5
0,"Not impressed at all, sleep tracking doesn't always do its job. No real benefit even when it does track. This is my personal opinion and experience. Maybe someone else would think completely different.",2
0,"I bought this in May 2020 to help keep track of my daily steps (thanks Corona) and barely a year later, the watch face no longer turns on - if it does it's stacticky blue with white bars going across it for a few seconds before turning off again. It'll still track steps - but you can only view them on your phone.",1
1,"I really love this device! It's my first Fitbit. The only other similar device I have had was some sort of knockoff, so I don't have much to a basis for comparison. I have tested the accuracy of steps, floors, and sleep, and they're all working as they should! I do recommend this product. *I do remove it when I'm going to have my wrists submerged in water and before I shower, so I can't speak for the water resistance.",5
1,The tracking information was really off I did comparisons of when I worked out and when I didnt work out and took a day to relax and results were fairly similar. But the battery life is good.,3
1,I liked the easy setup and being able to use it as soon as it arrived. I use it daily to keep track of my activities.,5
1,They just keep getting better. Watch works great and the battery life is pretty decent. Nice features and great for working out accuracy.,5
1,I really like this fitbit! It is classy looking and seems accurate. It is making me walk more! I do wish the battery would last longer between charges.,5
0,"Update... Upon contacting customer service I can only give this item 1 star. Customer service sucks. Luckily I bought this through amazon so I got it taken care of through Amazon.In theory, if this thing would work properly, it would be great. However, it does not connect to Bluetooth and the battery life is less than one day. Certainly not the 6+ days that fitbits website proclaims..... Maybe I got a knockoff???",1
1,"Love this watch!!!!! Way better than an Apple Watch. So worth it! It counts your steps, hooks up via Bluetooth to your phone so you can answer calls, and you can add apps to it like Starbucks.",5

 Love my Fitbit versa! I’ve had previous Fitbit versions and this one is my favorite by far. It’s not an Apple Watch by any means, but I can get text messages, see who’s calling me, calendar alerts and reminders. Sometimes I don’t think the heart rate is completely accurate during workouts but whenever I’ve checked on my own, it seems to be within 2-3bpm, so I must be the crazy one 😜",5
0,Delivered on 5/28. Return date closed 6/27. Fitbit battery stopped holding charge on 7/24. Apparently this is a problem with Versa 2.,2
0,The watch face fell out for no reason. I contacted Fitbit but they wouldn't address the issue until I gave a review. I can't give a review until I know what the outcome is. SKIP IT!,1
0,"if you don't have internet connection, the phone app does not work, even if you have Bluetooth connection, and the second problem is the GPS, it always lose the connection, or take to lone time to connect to you phone, if you check the map application, it work fine and have you position, but when you go to sport app (i use RUN), always appear ""connection"", and it will lose a lot of km.",2
0,Bought the watch to mainly monitor my heart rate and SPO2 during sleep. Received watch to only find out that I have to purchase additional apps to monitor heart rate and O2 during sleep. Versa one watch had all of these features and more without purchasing additional apps. I gave the watch away. Will never wear another Fitbit product.,1
1,"It won’t stay connected. So IM using it as a watch and pedometer but that it. I constantly would be going back in to connect all the apps. The weather, Spotify, prentice stay connected. Never tried more than that because I was so frustrated.",3
1,"This watch is pretty good. The heart rate tracker seems a little off, I would be laying on my bed for awhile and the bpm would track at 100 or over. I mainly use it for the time (obviously), tracking steps, and getting notifications.",3
1,Only had it for about a day but so far I really love it. Design is beautiful and fits more comfortably on my wrist than the ionic. I’ve been a long time Fitbit user so this was an easy transition. Really excited to try out the new features. So happy with my purchase.,5
0,did not last more than three months face came apart awful workmanship will never buy another,1
1,"Love tracking my steps, but this version is not as good as the previous one I had. The band sticks to my skin a lot more. Also, the vibration for the reminder is weaker and easier to miss. I don't use many of the advanced features since I don't have Alexa and I don't like sleeping with it on. I do like the way it looks more than the Fitbit 2 I previously had.",4
0,"Worst smart watch ever, apps do not work, will not stay connected to my Samsung phone, save your money and move on to another product, going to return this and buy a better watch",1
1,Have the Versa 2 since the day it came out and like it very much so far. I like it's fitness and sleep tracking and find it to be very accurate. The new screen is fantastic and the smartwatch functions are working perfectly for my liking.,5
1,Love the watch but not the band. Ordered another band.After 5 months my watch will only charge to 70% and i have to charge it everyday. It will not hold a charge,5
1,"Use this as a watch and since I have back issues, it shakes at me every hour during the day at work to get up and take 250 steps",5
1,MY HUSBAND LOVES HIS NEW VERSA 2. I WASN'T SURE IF IT WOULD BE A HIT BECAUSE HE ONLY WEARS INVICTA WATCHES. THIS FITBIT WAS A HIT! I guess INVICTA has a little competition. All of the trackers on the FITBIT are great.,5
0,"The watch died after 3 weeks, wouldn't recharge, wouldn't turn on when plugged in. Returned and got a Garmin.",1
0,"Well I did like it, but died today less than a year old 😩 $163 and should last longer than one year. My Blaze lasted a few years. Very disappointed.",2
1,"Sometimes difficult to connect to my app on my cellphone. It would be nice if it had the EKG feature like the apple watch. Otherwise, it is OK. I still have not figured out how to load music in the app.",5
1,I do not have the subscription so I really can't address the smart features as many do not work without the subscription. Otherwise I am very pleased.,5
1,I like I can keep track of all I need and want!,5
0,"I live in a high mountainous area where cell phones DO NOT work - smart or otherwise. The Fitbit and Amazon websites do not make it clear that the Versa 2 tracking app will only work with smart phones. My original One and my brother's Blaze have computer interface capabilities. But not the Versa 2. According to Fitbit support they are working on this but have no idea when a computer app will be available. In the meantime, I was sold something that doesn't work.",1
1,So far I’m really enjoying my Fitbit! I love that it syncs to my iPhone and I can receive text messages on it! The sleep tracking is a bit off but I’m not that concerned about that. Would definitely recommend!,5
1,I had an older one that was needing charged about every other day. This one is lighter and a smidge smaller. Plus is suppose to get ~6 days on a charge.,4
1,"I am allergic to the silicone band it seems, got a nasty rash. So I had to purchase fabric band replacements. Otherwise it's a great product!",3
1,I HATE the fact the fact the on off function button is not in the standard location of very watch in the world,4
1,I reason for this watch was to monitor my wife' rate . iIt has proven to do the jpb.,5
1,I just love this watch ! It replaces the last one I had - which broke sadly. But the last one didn’t have Alexa and didn’t have quite as many functionalities. I am not going to try using it to swim - that’s how I broke the last one - so I can’t vouch for it being waterproof I’m afraid. But in every other aspect the watch is fabulous and I love it !I bought some fun-coloured straps to go with it as the one I was given was a bit boring - off the internet.I am just delighted with my purchase thank you !🤗🤗🤗,5
1,"Bulky and not easy to if use, especially the app.",3
1,"3rd device....Blaze, Versa now Versa 2. Love them all. Apple customer, but for fitness tracking...Fitbit better bang for the buck.",5
1,The Fitbit Versa is a better than the Polor Heart Rate Monitor. Vety user friendly accurate measurements.,4
1,Bought for hubby to replace his old fitbit hr. So much easier to read and so many more functions. He is very happy with the versa,5
0,They don't make it easy to change bands from one size to another. They change this way of size changing not worth the time.,2
1,"I’ve really enjoyed this product up until about a week or two ago. The touch screen has started to not respond to my touch, so I can’t even check my stats. Not such a big deal, except I paid a good amount of money for this product to not function right after 4 months of use.",3
1,I love this watch so much. It does everything that the Apple Watch does and the price is phenomenal. I had the Blaze before and it was just too odd shaped for taste. I love this one.,5
1,Love the size of the screen! This product is easy to use and accurate. Love the Fitbit app.,5
1,"The features of the watch itself are great and do everything you could ever want or need. The reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because of how it's made. The pins that hold the bands in aren't actually metal at all, but instead some really weak plastic. Today was the first day wearing the watch and the very first time I bumped the watch on something the pin somehow bent and also punctured and ripped the band. After just 3 hours of use I can't wear it until I get a new pin and band.",3
0,"After a solid week of trying to get along with this watch I've decided to return it. I really need a watch that interacts easily with my note 9. This watch won't even find my note 9 from 3 inches away. It refuses to give me any notifications even though all permissions are authorized. Its just not what I need, it has pre installed useless apps. Im going back to my samsung watch. This one is not a good fit for what it cost.",1
1,I use this device for everything it says it does especially for my sleep tracking.,5
0,"I'm very disappointed in my Fitbit. After my updates, I can't get it to sync with my phone. If I could give a zero star, I would!",1
0,The chemicals on the band burned my wrist and when I tried contacting the company they ignored me.,1
1,"Bought this for my husband, Father’s Day gift. He loves it, keeps count of his steps. He’s lost 40 pounds",5
0,It is supposed to be waterproof and just going into the ocean for 2 mins - my fitbit stopped working!,1
0,"I bought the fit it thinking it would do what an iphone would do. However, I did not check the operating system required to sync the Fitbit with the phone. As a result, I cannot sync my phone to my watch. It does nothing but count steps, and that is not accurate unless you are swinging your arms.",2
1,Pensé q podría recibir mis llamada en mi versa 2 pero no es así solo la puedes aceptar pero tienes a hablar en tu cel,4
1,I love this Fitbit! It’s so much better and ‘smarter’ than my Fitbit Alta! And it literally makes me move! Love Love Love it!,5
1,"Love how long this FitBit holds a charge! Easy to use, seems accurate. Does everything I need it to.",5
1,"I purchased the Versa 2 after having the Charge 2 for 3 years. I love all the new features including Alexa. It’s east to set up and easy to use. I like the larger, colorful display and the longer battery life. I use it for my sleep tracking as much as steps. I recommend Fitbit to anyone wanting a fitness tracker watch.",5
1,Purchased the versa two to replace my blaze. I didn’t realize how many missed steps were happening. I’ve had my blaze for five years and it was definitely time for the upgrade. This is an amazing upgrade! I love being able to customize the clock face with pictures of my family,5
1,"Great smartwatch alternative! A reasonable cost gives good access to health metrics, Amazon Alexa, watch, great battery life, etc. Highly recommend it.",5
0,"The fitness and sleep tracker work great, that is if the watch is working. The original one that was purchased worked for 4 months and the replacement worked for two weeks. Two separate problems. The original watch developed n issue with the button which I found out is very common, the second watch just stopped turning on. Gonna go with a Garmin smart watch next time.",1
0,Loved this watch when it worked. Literally died after only four months. Return policy is only 30 days. This was a second purchase after my first fit bit stopped working after 1 year. Will not purchase again It’s not worth the money for such a limited lifetime of the product. Really sad…I like it a lot …..but who can afford to repurchase a watch at $150 every four months???,1
1,"The Versa 2 is very nice, but after about a month of use, it has stopped receiving text messages and fit bit has no answers. Very frustrating. They are aware and working on a fix, but can't tell you when it will be fixed. You pay for somehing and expect it to work as stated. Very frustrated.",3
1,"This product shipped quickly and the packaging had no damage! The watch works very well, and has pretty accurate tracking. I love the sleep feature as I get to see how often I wake up throughout the night! The Fitbit App was super finicky when I first purchased my watch, where it wouldn't properly sync with my watch, but after the latest update, it automatically syncs every 15-20 minutes which is great!",5
1,"The app works well, you can track almost everything from the watch. Easy to use and set up. Couldn’t ask for better.",5
1,I love my fitbit versa. It does everything it's supposed to. I also love that the face is customizable (in app purchase). The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the screen scratches VERY EASILY.,4
1,The item arrived in a few days it was already charged at 60% so it was ready to go out of the box. It only needed connecting,5
1,"I really love this new Fitbit, but I wish the bands were easier to change. My old fitbit was really easy to change them out",5
0,after less than two years and the battery is dead and the screen popped out. this thing is notorious for having bad batteries and not being nearly up to the advertised water resistance.If you're expecting this to last any length of time or... be a quality product by any metric maybe don't buy it.,1
1,"I’m very pleased with my purchase. It really tracks well especially my sleep. There are many clock faces to choose from. Even though I can’t answer incoming calls or texts, I can see who’s calling and texting without looking at my phone right away. For me, it’s a good value for the price. I recommend this Fitbit.",5
0,"I bought this in May and it lasted until August. I've tried everything I could think of to make it work. It didn't get wet, it wasn't dropped it just suddenly stopped working. The screen is just blank. Considering how much I paid for this, I'd expect at least a year out of it. Severely disappointed.",1
1,I use it for tracking my sleep and how far I walk it works great I even bought my fiancé one,5
1,Absolutely what I was looking for! Definitely recommended if you are looking for a good smartwatch without making a hole in your pocket!,5
1,"I use this product to keep track of my steps. It's not performing the way I expected it too. This evening it's not allowing me to swipe away my email notifications. The beginning of the week it didn't give me notification of reaching my 10,000 step goal. It's obvious to me as time goes it will get worse and then I'm out of luck",3
1,He loves it. It tells him who is calling his phone which his old Fitbit did not do.,5
1,"Having trouble getting alexa working on watch goes to echo , which is in another room.",4
1,My fitbit is absouelty amazing!! I love the look of it and I used to have an iwatch and I think it is much better,5
1,Thank you for creating this beautiful watch,5
1,"I think it does a pretty great job overall. But, there are some inaccuracies with sleeping and walking. I think this is a pretty typical situation based off complaints on the actual website. Still really enjoy the product and am using an it for baseline knowledge.",3
1,"LOVE this watch!!! You can pick any face you want, the battery lasts almost five days, you can get texts and respond to them and see who is calling your phone. Plus there are so many cool bands tovoair with it.",5
1,I like the watch overall but the microphone has stopped working correctly. Apparently this a know issue and I've seen it firsthand. I've tried all the trouble shooting steps that can be found online but nothing has made a difference. I'll be contacting FitBit to get a replacement. Just disappointing in how the mic stopped working.,3
1,"First time owning a fit bit and I'm loving it. Easy to track my sleep, and the goals are adjustable so I can achieve them! The app is great and easy to navigate.Update... Fit bit no longer charges or turns on. Not sure what the issue is. Wife's still works.",3
1,"The fitness part of the watch are ok, i was looking for futures of sinking my phone to as well ...i haven't figured it out yet if i can without paying extra ...Now im looking for another watch that will provide connection to my phone.",3
0,"I have consistent problems every few days with this watch. Though I like the design and all the info it gives. It stops syncing, only if I restart my phone will it sync. My clock face randomly changed, then the app got an error I couldn't get out of. This watch DOES NOT work how it's supposed to.",2
1,"Mom's previous Fitbit broke, so we replaced it. I think she likes it. It might take some getting used to because it's a different model, but I think she will continue to find new reasons to like it as time goes on.",5
0,"The only thing that is always correct is the time. The heart rate works half the time. The sleep tracking worked, maybe 3-4 days out of the 3 weeks I've had it. Syncing has stopped working after a couple weeks. Very disappointed & will return.",1
1,"very good item, but the application for Huawei mobile phones does not have all the functionalities and they are not very compatible.",4
1,My son loves his Fitbit watch. The only complaint that we have is that the glass easily scratches. I have had my I watch for 5 years and only has a couple of scratches. He received his Fitbit watch for Christmas 2019 and it has a whole lot of scratches.,4
1,Love my versa 2 does everthing i wanted plus so much more having a hard time connect ing my wireles head phones otherwise easy to set up and i am technology challenged,5
0,I only had it for a week. I turned it off and it wouldn't turn back on. Returned it.,1
1,"I love calculating my steps, sleep and heart rate. The only problem with the product lies with my skin sensitivity. I have been developing a rash from the band or metal so I switch wrists that I wear it on.",4
1,The battery life is not what was advertised. I still have to charge every other day and I do not have any added apps. Customer service is not as good as it was before Amazon bought it. This is my third and probably last Fitbit,5
1,"Needs frequent re-charging. It was difficult to set up since I did not understand this device needed its app using my I-phone. I had thought it was a stand alone device. Needs accessories to have music connection, etc.",3
0,"I got the versa 2 a year ago and I really enjoyed it. Sleep tracking, use of Alexa, answering phone calls with it and so on. However, as of late the screen has been unresponsive even after restarting the watch. I would like if my smart watch would last longer than a year before needing to be replaced.",2
1,"Did not work correctly. Said I hit 10,000 steps while I was sitting down. Changed to a Samsung Active. Love it.",3
1,Sleep details seem accurate however distance and steps do not seem to be as accurate. When walking with my wife our data does not agree. Syncing can also take numerous attempts and time before registering.,4
1,Comfortable and light weight. Beautiful display and it has many useful features.,5
1,"I had Versa but Sleep tracking didn't work. Bought the Versa 2, same thing. Now they tell me it is my 4G phone. Funny thing is, it did work when I first got it. Not worth the money. No support.",3
1,This Fitbit is great. I’ve had mine for almost a year and I love it. It keeps track of all my activities and my oxygen levels while I sleep. It actually does too much to mention here. I highly recommend it.,5
0,I've had this watch a little over a month and now the screen has randomly gone completely black and won't work. I've tried to do the reset and nothing. It's not reliable for the amount I paid.,1
1,Fits great and was exactly what I wanted to help track my steps and other exercise goals. The app is great as well.,5
0,Watch is nice but as far as adding friends is a joke. I allowed everything to be accessed and still no contact list shows up. Very disappointed. Apparently this is an old un fixed problem. Also have had it 2 months and the band already broke,1
1,This was easy to set up and to start tracking. I bought for my husband so that he can track his exercise and sleep. Just the first day he was able to see a lot about his sleeping patterns.,5
0,I ordered this in January and it has stopped taking a charge. This seller won’t replace it less than 5 months later,1
0,"This was my 4th and final Fitbit. I purchashed it in September 2020 and the screen separated from the watch last week. Up until that point, I truly enjoyed the watch. Especially the fitness and sleep tracking. I was hoping this watch wouldn't fall apart or malfunction like the last 3, but no such luck. Fitbits are way too expensive to lack durability. I think I'll finally give the Samsung watch a try.",2
1,I had a Garmin Forerunner before this but it got lost on a river trip. Decided to try the Fitbit out again because of price.While it is definitely not as exact on GPS or as strong on battery life as the Forerunner it is a comfortable and stylish looking watch for the price.,3
1,I love this fitbit. The the pink color is so beautiful and looks just like the picture. I've had mine for almost two months. It's been amazing. It has helped me track my exercises and track my sleep. It is definitely a must have.,5
1,Really like this watch. Looks good and works really well as far as I can tell. The Fitbit app has some issues but that could be a problem with my phone. Overall a good choice.,5
1,What an amazing watch ⌚!! What I liked about it is the ability to see all your vital signs right there on the face without having the pay extra like versa lite. A must have in the health care setting.,5
1,"I love this whole watch!!!Sleep tracker is a plus, it breaks down your different stages of sleep. It has a menstrual, fertility feature , it also has a find my phone button. I am not using half of this phones functions/ abilities yet but hope to soon.",5
0,It stopped syncing like most Fitbit devices i have purchased.,1
1,"Fits comfortably on most any wrist, is stylish and fun, but most importantly has incredible functionality. I love being able to track my heart rate during workouts and visualize my progress over time. The sleep insights are very cool and show you how well and how much you are sleeping. Tracking food is easy enough, and getting reminders and encouragement about movement is super motivating. I love this thing, and all of the things it can do. If you are like me, and need an extra bit of motivation to get started on a fat loss journey, a FitBit is a must-have.",5
1,It’s amazing. Does everything I need. Love it that it buzzes me when I have a phone call coming in. Gives the weather to. It notifies me when I am short my steps for each hour.,5
1,"Works pretty well, occasionally have trouble getting it to connect and I have to sync it multiple times - but that doesn't happen very often. Comfortable and has a large easy to read face.",5
1,"I loveee this fitbit! It has so many features. You're able to download different clock faces and use any of them that you download. Scenic cabin, beautiful sunsets and many more. It’s way more comfortable to wear than my other fitbit. I just ordered different colored bands and screen protectors too that are colored. You wont be disappointed with this fitbit 😊",5
1,"Nice watch, really like it. This is my 4th Fitbit. I bought the Ionic in July. Giving that one to my son. My only complaint is Amazon dropped the price on this one two-days later and would not honor the price drop.",5
1,"Loved first Fitbit and wore it out. Bought this Versa 2 and I love the added information at my wrist. It really helps to keep me on track with walking, cardio, etc.",5
1,I really wish that I had purchased this sooner. It’s great for staying on track. Have had zero issues. Very stylish as well,5
1,"I love this watch. Can see date, time, heart rate, calories burned at a glance. Easy to track your excerise, food intake & calories burned. One CON is battery life only last about 1 1/2 days. Otherwise, great choice.",5
0,Don't waste your money. It will not sync with my mom's iPad at all. Tried everything and customer service was not helpful at all.,1
1,I really Like it. It seems like everything it tracks is very accurate. The band is ok but if you wear it a lot it kind of gives you a rash. That’s an easy fix though with a new band so still worth the price.,5
1,I am very happy with my fitbit versa 2.,5
1,"It was not easy to set up...but directions, Youtube and a techie friend got me set up. Love my tracking and reminders to move hourly....well worth the effort...",5
0,The face of my watch fell off. I was just sitting at the dinner table eating and I look down and it was dangling. I haven't had it but maybe 9 months. Im pretty upset since it cost so much. Had anybody else experienced this?,2
0,I purchased a Fitbit for myself in March. My husband wanted one so he purchased one in April. He is not pleased with his and would like to return it for a refund. It does not work properly. Please forward a mailing label so that we can return it. Thank you!,1
1,This is a great alternative to an Apple watch! You can do so many things on it including Alexa capabilites and voice text to respond to messages. Love the color and all the app options on the watch face and I love that you can customize your watch face with different backgrounds and pictures!,5
1,Dislike that I have only owned this 1 year and 5 months and the screen/face no longer works. When I read how to try and fix it many of the reviews said it was a common thing. Don't buy unless you want to replace it yearly!,5
1,Not an Apple Watch but has a lot of nice features! The sleep tracker is amazing and being able to view texts is super nice when I’m at work and can’t have my phone on me in case someone is trying to reach me for an emergency,5
1,"So, the band thing is real. Never a rash or rub from something like this in my life, and my wrist has a raw spot. Otherwise I love this. It's my third smart/fitness watch and it's my favorite.",5
1,some features are easy to use. what isn't talked about upfront is that to get the most out of this device you need to sign up for multiple services paid for monthly in order to get the most out of the device.,3
1,"Love this!!! I was worried about it being uncomfortable, but it's actually very comfortable. I've had other fitbits, but this is by far the best. The rose gold and plum colored band are very classy looking.",5
1,"My only complaint is that it doesn’t show notifications for my texts but that could be user error.Sleep tracking works really well, it says calories burned, floors, distance walked and steps.",5
1,LOVE THE ITEM AND ALL THE FEATURES,5
1,I can’t sleep with this on its feels so uncomfortable. I often take it off in the middle of the night when I try to get sleep tracking done. The band is just uncomfortable.,4
1,"Love the battery life, and sleep analysis is good. But the available clock faces are rather juvenile and unattractive.",4
0,"Fitbit has revised their platform. meaning in order to track sleep or steps, yes I said that correctly, you have to subscribe to their monthly or yearly fees. whats is unethical is that even if you've had a Fitbit and were tracking steps, workouts, sleep, etc that data is now gone. It has been removed from your profile until you pay these fees.",1
0,Sleep- Not so Accurate.Step Count- Not so accurate. If i move or wave my hand it counts as a step. & Now less than a year later it won't even turn on!? $200 Buyer beware!!!!!,2
0,I has a bit of a problem with the first one sent. Had another unit fail miserably. Started locking up and rebooting itself many times a day. Had enough of these and will find another brand of tracking device.,1
1,The Versa 2 adds 1000s of. steps when you are driving.,3
1,The Alexa functionality is what sold us on this watch however it could use more Alexa functionality. It only supports basic commands and often has a hard time hearing the Speech to Text.,5
1,I switched from the Ionic to the Versa2 and I couldn’t be happier with it!,5
1,I bought it for a gift and they really like it does everything they wanted sleep tracker heart rate Its a nice watch.,5
1,I think the app is easy to use and has an adequate amount of features. I have a Google Pixel 3 XL and the notifications are not great on the watch. Notifications come when they want and are NOT consistent.,4
0,Lo devolví x que salió defectuoso.,1
1,I wear this everyday all day and I love it!! If you aren't looking for a lot of apps and you want something that works then buy it!!,5
1,"Less than a year, the adhesive holding the screen to the body of the watch failed. Have been struggling with FitBit customer service to get repaired or replaced.",4
1,"Wow this was an amazing buy and i love the features that this watch has, so enjoying the sleep tracks and fitness levels.",5
0,This watch is terrible. Charge it before work in the morning and it’s dead before dinner time. Definitely unhappy with this purchase.,1
0,Purchased this watch on 12/13/19 Within weeks the voice recognition stopped working.. I've been swimming in neck deep water a dozen times and frequently wear it in the shower. Today it started acting funny and reboot looping until it just died... Won't respond. $130 FOR 289 DAYS of light use is quite ridiculous and I WILL NOT BE BUYING ANOTHER FITBIT PRODUCT.,2
1,Bought this as a gift. They wear it everyday,5
0,Only lasted 12 1/2 months. It won't charge. The battery is probably dead. Sad sad. As soon as the 1 year warranty expired 2 weeks later it quit . Wow good timing Fitbit. I will not recommend. Poor product.,1
0,"Product is clearly defective. I didnt wear for an entire day, yet it logged 3,000 steps. I will be returning this.",1
0,"bought this watch back in January worked fine for me except for basic music controls,But now watch restarts randomly and when it does work after a trillion looped restartsthe touch screen is unresponsive after recent update, pretty much bricked because of software issues.",1
1,"Sleep tracking is great, and it seems srep tracking is accurate. My biggest complaint is that the ""250/hr"" is not accurate. It has not given me ""credit"" for at 250/hr on a fairly regular basis. I do love the availability of so many watch faces to choose from.",4
0,"Just received for Xmas gift. Love the look compared to my old galaxy smart watch. Tracker is more accurate than galaxy tracker, but trouble receiving any text messages. Tried everything, chatted with rep still can’t get it to work when just on Bluetooth, very frustrating!",1
1,"Very disappointed, HR is extremely inaccurate, confused on why you can answer my phone but can't talk from the watch, not worth the price. Not as high tech as it should and could be. Very disappointed",3
1,"I’m in love! The app is amazing! The interface is user friendly, the watch face is customizable. for the $200 price point though I was expecting more a less plastic feel. It is very sturdy though.",4
1,Large face takes some getting used to wearing. Can change bands easily. Easy to operate,5
1,"I have difficulty figuring out the many uses. I love tracking my steps, heart rate, calories burned.I have trouble with other features.",5
1,Been using Fitbit for years and like their products. I like this one because it is easy to read and works great. Battery life is 4-5 days,5
1,Coming from a blaze this was a huge improvement. I loved my blaze but I needed something that was able to be submerged. I wish the app had more capabilities as far as tracking but it does track quite a bit as it is.,5
1,I don't need\want all the features of the apple watch or the Samsung variant. This fits the bill perfectly. I love the stand alone music and alarms within with watch. If your in the fitbit ecosystem this is the a great upgrade.,5
1,Exactly like Versa 1. Does as it says. Too bad you have to purchase premium package to get ALL the options.,4
1,"Awesome device. Really helping me to rebuild fitness habits. I really like the sleep measuring capabilities. Also, the device works great with my samsung galaxy note 10+. I had to take some extra steps to go into some of the apps(like messenger, etc.) that i wanted notifications on. But once i updated the notifications in the fitbit app as well as those others on my phone, it all works like a charm.",5
1,"I loooooove my Fitbit, I have used it everyday since I got it !!!!It's accurate and rewarding as it tracks your progress in real-time.",5
1,"Working well so far. Seems a little off for sleep tracking but overall gives a good summary, I did change the band for a more comfortable lightweight Velcro one.",5
0,My watch takes a long time to synchronize with the app on my phone. The battery doesn’t last more than 2 days. The only positive is that it tracks my steps and sleep but again you actually have to open the app on your phone in order for the watch to register any data. Frustrating.,1
0,"Device was fine, worked fine, no problems. One day it had 85 percent battery. Went to sleep and in the morning it showed red alert, no battery power. Very unusual as it always lasts a few days without charging. Charged for days, tried resetting, every trick in the book, cleaning contacts....nothing. Completely died after just one year with zero warning. 179 for a device that lasted a year is ridiculous.",1
1,"The Versa 2 counts steps well. It's hard to update; app is often ""unable to find device."" Alexa feature is not worth the extra cost. It can answer only the most basic questions, like the current weather.",3
1,I am enjoying the calories in/out feature and knowing the distance during my walk but the heartbeat tracker is ridiculously wrong!! Seriously if I were a worrier these numbers would have me checking in the hospital.,3
0,I bought this for my husband in January because he really liked mine and his just quit working screen went black and won't turn back on we tried charging it and still nothing. I didn't get a warranty because mine has lasted so long with no issues so now we are screwed 🙃,1
0,"Syncing stopped working after only 2 weeks. Looks like a common problem with this device, especially with Android phones.",2
0,I don't recommend this product what so ever. I have gone through 2 in a year. They work for about 4-5 months(give or take) and then stop working. I'm getting ready to be on my 2nd replacement in a year(3rd one overall). It sucks!,1
1,"I really love this product. It was securely packaged and received it within a week. It takes my heart beat, counts my steps, vibrates when I get a call or text. It’s user friendly, very easy to set up and sync up to my cell and my computer. I am very happy",5
1,Love the ease of use with the touch screenCan also download different watch faces. The addition of the Alexa app is a great feature,5
0,"I'm so mad I bought this. I messaged their support team because this is a lot of money to me, I asked have they heard anything about a third one coming out and they said no, so I bought this. Now the 3 just came out and my return window has closed.",1
1,"Had a Moto360 for years, picked up a cheap Amazfit Bip. Researched Wear OS watches and several fitness watches. Loving this. Excelling water resistance, great display, good features and all my notifications work. On Android.",5
1,"It was quite difficult to get the Fitbit connect app to sync on my Mac for music transfer but once it finally worked, I’ve had no complaints. I really like it so far. The water log is very helpful too.",5
0,I got this fit bit for Christmas and by January it just would work right. The screen freezes and I’m unable to swipe for options. It doesn’t stay synced with my app on my IPhone 8 and when I try to sync it i have to try several times before it actually works. I had a Fitbit before this and it work well for years without issue but this model sucks. And I can’t send it back through Amazon because it started having issues outside of the refund date. And nothing on fitbits website has helped.,2
1,"I love my versa 2. It keeps me on track with my exercise goals with the reminders. And the hr tracker I find helpful. It's excellent with texts, emails and many other applications, too.",5
1,"Really nice fitbit, I like the large digital display. I find it a motivation to excersise more. I do have a problem with wearing the device for more than a day or two as the wide plastic band causes skin irritation.",4
0,"The first week the Versa held a charge for three days. After that, I was lucky to get twelve hours from it. Today, after charging for three days, it’s totally blank. Nothing will turn on even though it says it’s 100% on my phone. Don’t buy!!!",1
0,I found it to be a waste. Didn’t really do much. Nothing important to me. Difficult to set up abs operate.,2
0,I liked it until it died after 10 months use. Second time this happened to me.,1
1,Had mine for about 6 weeks and love it!,5
1,"Disappointed with the Fitbit versa 2. While I expected the steps taken to be inaccurate I was counting on the sleep tracker to be accurate and it is not. For ex: one morning I woke up at 7:30, took my dog outside and came back in at 7:40. When I synced my phone to the app to update, it said I was asleep until 7:39. Unfortunately nothing about this app is accurate.",3
1,"Amazing wearable, but the screen popped off the body and the display is pure white.",3
1,I use it daily. Stays charged. Easy to use,5
0,There was nothing to like about this watch.,1
1,I took a chance and purchase an Amazon refurbished Versa2 for Android phone pairing. I LOVE IT ! works as expected.,5
1,Bought this almost two years ago and it's still working very well,5
1,I bought this watch to give to my daughter for her birthday. She absolutely loves the watch and finds it many functions to be very useful. She loves monitoring her sleep and activities in her yoga class.,5
1,I love my fitbit and have been super happy with it. I have had since November 2020 and now all of the sudden screen went black I can't see anything. It shows battery is fully charge but the screen is gone!,3
0,"I really liked it, but it is not a year old yet and I can’t get it to charge. Bought a new charger and it still won’t charge. Disappointed!",2
1,Switched from the versa to the versa 2. Love both. Alexa isnt fabulous but can handle simple things. So if you're looking at versas this is a good one! Battery life is longer than the original and that's a big plus!!,5
1,Love my versa 2. Wishing the Snapchat notification and Spotify music worked a little better but overall it’s great for tracking sleep and oxygen flow when I sleep.,5
1,My fiance has been wanting one of these for so long. She absolutely loves it! She wears is almost all the time and basically lives and breathes on the fitness tracking aspect. The only thing she complained about was the band that comes with it. She ended up buying less bulky bands because the one that came with it kept giving her a rash on her wrist and also making her workouts uncomfortable.,5
1,"I had this product for a week, and then tried to charge it. The charger would not charge the battery. I did all the things that they recommended in the ""FitBit Community"" and still no help. Finally, contacted customer support and they are sending a new FitBit.I like all the features of the FitBit Versa 2. I assume the new one that I will receive will have a battery that is chargeable.",3
1,It does not track sleep well. Some mornings no report at all. Very difficult to download music onto it.,3
0,"If the touch screen still worked, I would love the versa 2. I loved it until about a week or so ago when the touch screen just stopped working and nothing I've done has fixed it.",2
1,I love this watch!!The battery last about 7 days for me.I am able to get messages on my watch even when my phone is on a different floor,5
1,I gave it to my girl friend and she loves it,5
1,I absolutely love this watch. I have had the alta then switched to a fossil smartwatch. from that to a galaxy gear fit. Now I have this one and it is by far my favorite. the battery last about 5 days before needing to be charged.,5
1,"Great watch, has assortment of smart tech build into beyond stimple step counts.",5
1,My first FitBit purchase. Someone at the gym recommended this one. So much great information. And a motivator as well. Have to go online for in depth instructions. Larger band included. Purchase a clear protector for the face too.,5
1,I just upgraded from the Versa. This watch works great. I wish they were not hiding increased functionality behind a paywall with their premium service but understand that it now the world we live in.,5
0,"I bought the Versa 2 in Sept. 2020 after my first Versa crapped out. The Versa 2 stopped working this past weekend (mid Feb. 2021) after less than 6 months of less than hard use. I took very good care of it, kept it charged and it just stopped working. I like the features but can't afford to buy a new Fitbit every 6 months, which has been my experience. This was my 5th and probably last Fitbit.",1
0,I bought the watch for my daughter as a graduation gift. Unfortunately it wouldn't connect to her phone despite trying everything said on the community help site. I couldn't return it because returned date is overdue. what a bummer!!!!,1
1,"So with in the first week I had a pretty bad scratch across the screen. Pretty sure I didn't hit anything, not sure where the scratch came from. I used the Versa for over a year with out a screen protector and had a few small scratches on the glass. This one is significantly bigger. Do yourself a favor and get a screen protector.",3
1,"This fitbit is the bomb, I actually get up and move and I drink more water simply because it reminds me. I swim and I don't have to take it off",5
1,Works ok for price. But just sitting in chair & moving arm for anything triggers footstep counts. Very short charge life. Have to recharge every 3 days.,4
1,"My Fitbit only lasted 6 months before it started having problems. First lines on the bottom of the screen, then the touch screen wouldn't work, now,half the time the screen is black and won't show the time. It hardly syncs up to my Bluetooth. My first one lasted a year before it died. Amazon won't take it back even though it has a 1 year warranty and I bought the extended warranty, which was supposed to be sent to me. Very dissatisfied.",5
1,"So far it has a lot of features that I really like. The tracking and program are really good. Price beats the Apple Watch, but not having owned an Apple watch I don't know if features are equal.",5
1,"This is my 3rd Fitbit and my favorite thus far. Display is easy to read, has good app selection, can buy my Starbucks from my wrist. Awesome. Lol. Would recommend this!",5
1,Has a lot to offer. It does everything I am looking for. I would like to be able to twist my wrist and see the clock like I did with the charge 2. Tapping it is hard to do when working construction jobs.,5
0,"1. I dislike there was no power charger, cord only2. 7 months later, watch gets extremely hot when charging3. watch does not hold charge or work anymore4. Replace power block, still does not hold charge or come on.5. Anytime plug in and place watch on charger, gets hot.",2
1,This was a great gift I bought for my husband and my 10 year old son. The other reason I gave it 4 stars is because I have not figured out and cannot seem to figure out yet how to set up the Alexa on it.,4
1,"I was due for a new Fitbit. I had the charge 2 before and wanted an upgrade. I love the versa 2, it's great and I love that it comes with 2 band sizes. The pink is so pretty.",5
1,"I enjoy the reminders to more, how many steps I've taken, how many to meet goal, sleep habits, just starting to use all features.",5
1,"Disappointed in this. Was expecting the features to be a lot better for the price, my garmin with no subscription tells me more information than this. The features I wanted this for show no detail or don’t work. I probably will go back to my garmin and see if they have one that has more robust features.",3
1,Each Fitbit gets better and better. I love being able to set a background and treat it like a smart watch but being better able to monitor my health. Never had an issue with any of the watches ever.,5
1,Love this watch! Less money than an Apple watch but still works great with my iPhone!,5
1,I love this watch! I've used the Fitbit Blaze for the past 5 years and recently upgraded to this one. It has so many features I never knew I wanted! Very pleased with this purchase!,5
1,"I got my Versa 2 today, the set up was easy. Fits well with the adjustable strap. This is an upgrade from the previous Fitbits i have owned. I like it!",5
0,Didn’t work. Had to go through FitBit to get a new one.,1
1,"I really loved this at first but for some reason I cannot get my notifications on it anymore. Because of my job, that was one of the major selling points for me. I chatted with someone twice but to no avail. Once that gets fixed, I will give 5 stars.",4
0,The watch is ok but does not track rowing which is crazy to me and will not pair with apple airpods. Those are deal breakers for me. Wish I did more research before my purchase. I will be returning these asap.,2
1,The Fitbit is great at what it does but the band is giving me horrific painful rash that doesn’t go away no matter what I put on it. I did order a more breathable band that’s cloth and it’s a lot better.,3
1,"I've had it for about a month. I like it. I don't use it to track my sleep, as I like to have a watch-free wrist when I go to bed. But it works great for recording a jog and the fitbit pay feature is very handy when checking out at a store with touch capabilities (and starbucks, as they have a similar feature with the starbucks card)",5
1,"Tells me everything On my sleep, heart rate. I had a Versa for 3 years but then when my charger broke I just want a new 1 person to is great",4
1,I love this Versa 2 it's helping me keep track of my daily steps. It's a very pretty color.,5
0,For about 8 weeks after Christmas I really liked it. Then 2 weeks after return window closed all touch screen ability died and all voice control failed. I can read but can do absolutely nothing else. I would not recommend product at all.,1
1,Better than I thought it'd be! Fast charg 8 day life of charge . Very happy with this tracker.,4
0,Designed to run warranty period. Known issue and has not been resolved over the years. I wish I had known before the purchase. Never used it underwater or in extreme conditions. Heart rate tracking was all over the place in the recent months,1
1,"This was an upgrade, in my eyes, from my old fitbit. I had a 1st gen Ionic, and feel this watch is even better. It has all the ionic functions plus more. I do no find it 'glitchy' as I did my Ionic. The price was even better. Thank u to Fitbit, This is my 3rd one.",5
1,I really like the features and design. I am devoted to Fitbit as long as they keep making better and better products. My only complaint is the difficulty to swap out different bands. Its a pain!,5
1,LOVE IT!!! I upgraded from a Fitbit HR that I had for over 6 years & I am so happy with my new Versa 2!! I love everything about it!,5
1,Love this watch. It tracks everything you need. Great buy.,5
1,I love the Fitbit Versa 2. It's a great tracking device and keeps me informed of daily activities that I otherwise wouldn't have an inkling whether or not I'm getting enough exercise and sleep.,5
1,Works awesome and price was standard,5
1,It is much lighter than I thought it would be. I had a charge 2 and the Versa 2 doesn't seem any heavier. I like that you can change the clock face and that you can add music or use Pandora if you have bluetooth wireless earbuds.,5
1,I love this watch and all its apps. The only thing is it doesn't hold a long charge after charging. Seem to go down fast? Of course I could send it back but right now that is the only complaint.,4
1,"I really enjoy this watch! I definitely prefer it over the Apple Watch. Love the sleep tracking feature, although I don’t find it to be super accurate. It definitely serves its purpose though.",4
1,Most new features are useless. Many features a joke. I sold this on EBay instead of returning it as I tried to like it a month. Not worth extra hundred. Could not return because it works but not as it should have.,3
1,Loved the watch and features but broke when I took it swimming after a 6 months. Fitbit replaced it after numerous chats but took 2 months to get a replacement. Can't say I would suggest purchasing this model.,4
0,"Purchased this in April 2020 and 5 months later it stopped recording sleep accurately and now it is completely dead after installing their latest update. Disappointing. I have owned two other fitbits over the years. The Charge did the same thing but it took a few years to stop working, not 5 months.",1
1,I had a fitbit blaze for years. Did everything I needed. Thought somehow this new fitbit was going to be more exciting and have more feature.. it really doesnt. Just a very expensive updated look. Definite let down.,3
0,"I don't think this product was new as seller advertised. The watch has completely stopped working. It won't come on at all, despite my efforts to reset.",1
1,"I love my watch! The only downside is when advertised your not told you need to pay for the premium pandora in order to manage your music from the watch. All music apps need to be paid for. But honestly, it's not a big deal to me. Love the customization of the face watch, the reminders pretty much everything. I had a Fosil smart watch and I highly recommend the change to the Vitbit Versa 2.",5
0,My Fitbit VERSA face stopped working after 6 months. I used the label provided by Fitbit and sent it back via Fedex on May 7. It is still in transit on June 2 and Fitbit customer support has not been any help. They consistently tell me they will not do anything until FedEx delivers the package and it will take five additional days to process it. Recommend you buy a Garmin instead.,1
1,Love my new Versa 2 Fitbit. Good looks and all function accuracy has improved especially sleep monitoring.Bright color display and battery life is better too. Very happy with it.,5
1,"I was unsure if this would work for me. I have a tiny, bony wrist and was worried the face would be too big for me. But this worked so well! Perfect fit and works even better than I thought!",5
0,I can see calls coming in but not text,2
1,I like this with the exception of two things... it doesn’t hold a charge very long and sometimes when I’m walking it records a high number of stairs when I haven’t walked up any stairs.,4
1,My only real complaint is the straps. It’s almost like the design team sat in an office and smugly said “hmmm how can me make the straps so dysfunctional that our customers will re think their decision to try to customize this bad boy?”,4
1,"Love this. My daughter has epilepsy, so this helps me track her sleep patterns and heart rate perfectly.",5
1,Still dont hav it all figured out.I would like written Instructions in a booklet. Usage to me is not clear...Alexa...can 't get it to work at all. Very hi tech to me,5
1,"Just started using and primarily am interested in the sleep app along with the heart rate info. For steps...this is very inaccurate. It had me at 4.5 miles on Christmas Day, when I was on the couch most of the day and at 5 miles the day after.Any help on this would be appreciated...it seems it may be picking up some of the car movement??? Not sure",3
1,"Just love this fitbit versa 2 watch. Tracks my steps, shows the weather, calories burned, etc.",5
1,"Love my Versa 2. Not crazy about the code lock. I have to enter it all the time. But you can remove it so, it's all good!",5
1,Love my watch! I am dieting and this is a huge help with tracking exercise and counting calories. I enjoy picking watch faces that fit my mood or just make me smile 😃. Great investment.,5
1,I like everything about it but what is best is the battery power. I believe the sleep tracker is good but sometimes it seems track your sleep later than expected. The activities trackers are great and the GPS is very accurate.,5
0,"It works, when you're not active. Kind of defeats the purpose. When I'm working out, it stops tracking. Records my heart rate as more than 50-60 bpm less. Most frustrating thing ever. Too late at this point to return it. Haven't had a problem with it synching or with notifications. But wish it tracked my workouts and heart rate better. Don't waste your money.",2
0,"I received this product and I was never able to turn it on, the watch has been on charge for over 24 hours. Very unhappy with Amazon .Will return the fitbit Versa 2 Special Addition for a full refund",1
1,I like the features. Keeps me on track. Very user-friendly. Easy to pair with my Pixel. Getting one for my mother for Xmas,5
1,Love it. I got in on the snore beta which ended up being useless to me and drained my battery uber quick. I love the pay feature and the ability to reply to text messages from my wrist. Nice upgrades.,5
0,"I was so excited to treat myself to a smartwatch and after 3 days I was absolutely disappointed. It wasn't tracking my sleep, I couldn't view text messages (which was 90% of the reason I went with this model), and the step tracker was way off! I spent over 2 hours on the phone with technical support after the online chat support couldn't help me and the issues couldn't be resolved. I'll never waste money on a Fitbit product again!",1
1,Gave it as a gift to my dau6! She loves it!,5
1,I love this thing so far everything works good keeps pretty accurate on sleeping too.Good price also.,5
1,Love my Fitbit but not as water resistant as advertised. I stopped wearing it in the water and just guessed on exercise and added it manually.,4
1,App is OK. Would be MUCH better if fitbit would work with CPAPs for sleep data.,5
1,"I liked the ease of setup. The ease of charging with clip in. The battery doesn't seem to hold as long as stated. In a little over 30 days of use, I'm having only 2 days max use after a full charge.",5
1,"I am enjoying this fitbit! I bought a cheap one initially and it just couldn't track my health needs. This is informative and easy to use, seems pretty accurate as well.",5
1,"Love my fitbit!! Have had no issues, easy to set up with the app on my android phone. Keeps track of everything I need. Highly recommend and love the burgundy color!!",5
1,Can receive calls but cannot figure out if I can use text. I would prefer that to respond on my Fitbit if possible. Otherwise it’s pretty good. The wallet part didn’t work properly but could be the machine I was trying to use it on.,4
0,"I bought June 2020 and it stopped working a week ago...May 8, 2021. I would think it should last longer than that. Otherwise I enjoyed using it while it worked.",1
0,"I've had this for not even 2 years and I went to look at my watch and the face of my watch was hanging off. Not impressed. I was sitting in Hot Tub as usual. This is supposed to be ""Water Resistant up to 50 meters"". Definitely going to Apple. I paid $200 for something that has cheap glue. Not Cool.",1
0,"I love it,weather stepper,hr...but it hurts my wrist and arm no matter how I ware it...need neck holder,carrier??",2
1,"I have been using this Fitbit for about 5 weeks and this is my first one. I love it, it has really helped me stay on track and force me to get up and move. I will say battery life was great until I changed the clock face, now it seems to drain faster... Not a huge deal just a tad disappointing and today it didn't accurately track my fat burn. I highly recommend this Fitbit though, those issues haven't stopped me from living it",5
1,Timely arrival. Works as expected. Great quality,5
1,This tracks my steps very accurately. The heart monitor also sends to be very accurate. The bluetooth connection to my android is always present. The alerts to my watch are wonderful.,5
1,Please help. The entire face is hanging off . I need to know how to fix.,5
0,Still in box don’t understand how to get it to work. Book was so small couldn’t read it with out blowing it up on my cell. Too much info should be easier like 1/5 steps,1
1,Directions for installation would be helpful. Looks like everything is in Chinese. Slow to charge.,3
0,"I like this Fitbit that help me see how much I sleep, walk, and workout. I was looking forward to use Alexa music so I don't have to carry my phone in my short pockets anymore but it turn out it won't work. What a wasted and very limited on Alexa Fitbit. Just get Fitbit without Alexa. Also, be careful using wristband when you get sweat or it got wet. It gave be a bad rash. That never happened to me before. I decided to stop using Fitbit.",2
1,"Love this! Nice that you can change the face, pair with Pandora, get texts... It looks like an Apple Watch.Cons are that you have to charge frequently and unpairs from app often so if using as a timer or weather... have to re-pair with your device",4
1,I bought two echos and paid an extra 20.00! They were 49.99 each and I got 20.00 off which is still 80.00! They are now 29.99 each one! I expect to get an additional 20.00 off! I just bought it and now that price so soon? I would accept an Amazon gift card! I am a larger buyer at Amazon and expect a refund! Thanks for all you do at Amazon! It is appreciated very much !,5
1,Great watch/tracker. Not too bulky. I really like the band that came with it. I don’t feel like I need to change it. I recommend this product,5
1,"I received my Fitbit Versa 2 on May 2, 2020 and it was easy to setup. So far, I love it. Love the color. I did have to change the band to the larger size and it was easy to do. Although, it took me a couple minutes to get it attach but I got it. I have not had it long enough to see how it will hold up, but I'm very pleased with my purchase. Glad I finally got my Fitbit.",5
1,It's really nice that it comes with a longer band. It works great. I'm just not sure how accurate it is. So I'm a bit skeptical on the steps and the sleep tracker. I do have 2 complaints. The band is a giant pain to change and the band it comes with doesnt allow your skin to breath. So under the band it's always sweaty and I got contact psoriasis which clears up after a few days. So now I dont wear it as much as I did until I get a different band.,4
1,I love the color (rose gold). It is just a bit bulkier than the first versa. I love that I can still easily change out the bands. It does have a all day sync glitch that hopefully has been resolved with the recent update.,4
1,Got it for my wife (who didn’t want it). She now tracks both activity and sleep which is important to her. She loves it and it is part of her routine to have it on and track her activities.,5
1,I had a Fitbit that was 3 years old and finally quit working. I decided to go with Fitbit Versa 2 again and regret it. I constantly have trouble syncing with my I phone. I have to charge it about every 36 hours. I received a lemon!!! After 6 months of struggling to get this fit bit to work. It is stuck on the open screen. I have googled for possible help and tried everything suggested and still can not get past the home screen. Save you money and purchase an Apple Watch.,3
1,I like the clock face and the ease of access on the watch. The only dislike is it has an issue with disconnecting with my phone and I have to restart my phone.,5
1,This fit bit is awesome. It does so many cool things and is quite accurate. I have really enjoyed using it.,5
1,"Great watch. Runs for days. This is my second Fitbit. If you want to track your health, food consumption, water intake, heart rate workouts, and sleep this is the watch for you. It also integrates nicely with any smart phone",5
1,I like the sleep app. Quite accurate.,5
1,You cant make calls from this device but overall its ok. Tracks my health pretty well.,4
0,"Not sure why I got the V2 when my V1 went horrendously downhill so fast. The V2 at least has a longer battery life, for now. It still doesn’t sync with my phone correctly, nor does it display my text messages, etc. Basically the convenience features that separate this from a watch. Anyway, don’t buy one of these Fitbits.",1
1,I like that is is more customizable. It seems to track better than the last fitbit I had. I'm able to store pandora stations to it which will enable to to listen to music when at work more freely.,5
0,This is the second Fitbit I have owned and my wife has had two also. All 4 watches have died in less than 18 months. Fitbit does not stand by their product,1
0,Dead already after the only 7 months! I bought this to replace my versa lite that died after only a year. I will not be buying Fitbit again.,1
0,Doesn't work. Won't turn on even though the battery is fully charged.,1
1,My wife and I got each other one for Christmas. We both enjoy the sleep tracking and the exercise tracking. No problems so far. The sleep app doesn’t always give a score. I don’t know why.,5
1,I like this Fitbit very much. It’s easy to read out in the sunshine. It’s very nice for the price.,4
0,"I wanted one that connected to my phone.. this one does not let me see calls or texts. It does not hold a charge for long too and the screen does not stay on without draining the battery. Do not buy. I did consider returning it, but kept hoping I would like it..",2
1,I like its battery life has a very nice screen and Alexa support .also has an option to always stay on. but will cut ur battery life in half if you choose the always on option,5
0,"This is the worst present I’ve ever received. It will not synch properly, it loses connection to WiFi and Bluetooth and will not update version. I received this as a Christmas present in December. I’m over 65, but have never had so many issues. I tried three times during last 6 months to get it to work, and it will not. Every day, it has to be manually linked to WiFi and Bluetooth in my house!",1
1,It’s okay can’t tell if it’s accurate.,4
1,Got this for my husband. He checks this a few times an hour to make sure he is getting his steps in. It’s gotten him more active and out of the lounge chair. Yeah!,5
1,Love the battery life! Had a galaxy and had to charge everyday. This does just as good and lasts 4 days!,5
1,Love love love this Fitbit. My daughter bought it for my birthday and I’m really enjoying it. Love the feature that reminds you how many steps you have left each hour. The goal is to walk 250 steps so it’s a motivator for me to get up and get moving more.,5
1,I upgraded from Charge 2. The sleep tracker on my Fitbit Versa 2 doesn't seem to be as good as my Charge 2. Also the app keeps disconnecting. Wish I would have waited for something better to come out.,3
1,this is my third fit bit...each one has given me more challenges...,5
1,I used to wear a smart watch and a Fitbit tracker. The Versa 2 is the first one that actually feels like a legit smart watch. And it does the fitness tracking as well.,5
1,So much great info to track and helps me be more mindful of my activity throughout the day. I strongly encourage fitbit to add a screen protector that's included in the cost versus having to buy one separately.,5
1,"Love this so much. Had an older garmin before, this is much easier and has sleep tracking as well as many other smart features which let it stand apart.",5
1,I have had it for a year now and its been great. I recently have been doing lap swimming and it wont come back on now. Currently have it in rice. Haven't swaim very much with it so idk what happened. Disappointing.,4
0,"Watch didn’t even last a year. It’s usually in a protective cover, I’m not rough with it, I have a desk job so it didn’t get a ton of use. I was just walking in the office and it popped apart and does not work anymore. Second watch in a row that this has happened to.",2
0,"Well, it tacka my sleep pretty accurate which is what i bought it for but my brace band broke very easily. sucks! Have to figure out what to do now.",2
1,The battery lasts 3 or 4 days and everything works well. I forget all the features it has. But the spotify control is really useful,5
1,Got it for a gift for the wife. Had to set it up for her it was easy,5
1,I like knowing my sleep tracker matches how I feel.,5
1,"This is my first fitbit, and it did not disappoint. I set my goals and try my best to reach them every day. I am more active than I used to be and I feel more accomplished at the end of the day.",5
1,"I like the watch, but very disappointed with the sleep tracking. I can sleep all night and it will only track a portion of it. It has tracked the whole night twice out of abt two weeks. It just doesn’t work.",3
1,"I love the smartwatch, I just don't like how the band is not secured for the one I have. The latch cook comes off all the time. I can't tell how many times I have almost lost this Fitbit.",4
1,The product is just as advertised and it was received quickly.,5
1,"With all this down time I needed motivation to get more steps in per day. The Fitbit Versa 2 is a great motivator. And, as a result, I'm sleeping better. So its a win win.",5
1,The Fitbit Versa 2 seems to be very inaccurate compared to the Versa when it comes to heart rate. Not only is it often off but I’ve had times mid workout when I self measure my heart rate at 160 and the Fitbit says my heart rate is 42 (lower than it ever gets when I’m awake). The design also seems to catch my arm hair a lot. Other than that it’s great. Love the battery life!!!,3
1,I love my Fitbit versa2 . It’s a awesome product made very nicely and it helps me with in coming calls when my phone is not near me Pluse everything else heart rate ect great product thanks Amazon and Fitbit,5
0,"The tracking of steps is just Inaccurate! I can’t find a way to reset it either. Sleep and heart is off too. The reason I bought it was to calculate 10,000 steps a day or more and it’s not accurate.",2
1,Nice watch. Nice features. I did not realize when I bought it that you have to run the Fitbit app on your phone if you want to have gps while running or to use Alexa.,4
1,More accurate than the charge 3 I had. Unfortunately the band is silicone which I found I'm allergic to so I had to replace it which wasn't a problem.,5
0,"I liked this tracker originally but I am disappointed with its reliability. I received this item on Dec. 30, 2019. On May 9, 2020, it stopped working correctly. It will no longer sync and the main screen does not light up. I can't use it. It is not even 5 months old. Not a very good return for the money.",1
1,"The Lg black rubber band you sent with the Fitbit is cheap, too big and does not go in the slot to connect it. My husband dam near tore his nail off trying to put in place. I have taken a picture of it because it shouldn't make no sense from us getting it today, open the box and the thing falling apart smdh! I want a new black Lg band",3
1,Battery life not so great tho.,5
0,Don't Buy! This product doesn't stay connected with any of the apps or devices.Constantly having to do a device setup and now won't do anything. I will be returning this product and everything I bought to go with it.,1
0,Have not even had it 2 months and it quit working! 🤬 I am so pissed right now $200 gone for a piece of junk,1
1,I especially love the sleep tracking.,5
1,"Health, blood pressure, steps,etc",5
0,Often unable to synch. I had Fitbit One for years and it never had syncing problem. I am disappointed to know that new fitbit is worse than it’s predecessor.,2
1,I am very happy with my watch. I recently had bariatric surgery and as I'm getting to know my watch's features I find it super helpful.,5
1,The only thing I don't really love is the band. Doesn't feel all that secure to me. I love the watch though.,5
1,"Wife swears by them, she s happy, I m happy!",5
0,"Do not buy! Had for 3 months and will not charge. It worked great for those 3 months, but highly disappointed that it wont work at all due to not charging. Not worth buying for a 3month watch",1
0,I don't think fitbit has upgraded anything in 10 years.im so dissappointed in my versa 2.expwbsive and acting up not syncing.ive tried all fixes listed ...very sad.,1
1,"I love this Fitbit. Nice color, syncs w/ my Samsung galaxy s9 perfectly. Talk to texting works well. I'm very happy with it.",5
1,This is the best electronic watch I have had. It has many great features and easily goes four days on a charge. I also like the simplicity of receiving and sending messages through the watch.,5
1,It is a really good watch. I don't use all the features. But I love how it tracks my steps and makes it easy to remind me to get up and move. This is my second Fitbit and I like it way better than my last one.,5
1,"Was 100% happy with Versa2 for first 2 months. Then while doing yardwork I noticed face was hanging off. (Coworker shared same issue with his.) I superglued the face back on, but figured I couldn't trust it was waterproof anymore. Then just last week screen started flashing solid bright square Instead of display. I'm about to try one more time because of accessories, one being a cover that should prevent face from getting knocked off and starting my problems.",3
1,"Have never been able to get my texts to display on my iPhone. I’m pretty tech savvy and have tried everything. Watch stopped displaying fb msgs too but I was able to get that functionality back.Extremely disappointed.If you are not looking to use all the features of the smart watch and are simply looking for an activity tracker, you would be satisfied.",3
1,Bright display. Does everything I need,5
1,This is my 4th Fitbit watch. 2nd versus. It was well worth the upgrade.I LOVE how long the battery lasts and how very quickly it recharges!!,5
0,The unit ships with a small wristband that will fit a woman or child. The larger band ships loose. Trying to get the pins in the watch is almost impossible and I cut my thumb trying to install it.The engineers who designed this attachment should be fired ! (*&^% idiots,2
1,"Very usefull, now I can track my daily rutines, and other details",5
0,"Awful! I got it for my father! and it even is not working!!! :(I DO NOT RECOMMEND BUYING IT AT ALL!!! NEVER EVER!!!Update: I called Fitbit and no good response!DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!SEE similar videos on youtube, many people reported the same problem!!!!!",1
0,"I had to return the device because the step count was crazy. A lot of times when I woke up it says more than 350 steps. Opened a case with support for more than 2 weeks and no solutions beside factory reset. I'm waiting for a replacement.I don't know if it was only my device or if it's affecting the whole versa 2 family, I don't think so.",1
1,Love the size and how easy it is to read.,5
1,"I got my fiance a fitbit bc I wanted to know how many steps he took in a day. & it was waaayyy more than I thought it would be! Over 25, 000 steps! I'm very pleased to say he loves his new watch.",5
1,"The best feature is the battery life! Yes!! I get at least 5 days use. I use the watch for fitness purposes mainly. Added benefits is being able to check texts, emails, etc. The look is ver attractive as well!",4
0,"Data error was main screen when turning on for the first time. Decided to call Fitbit and they acted like its a common problem. 30+ min on the phone and they said its all fixed. Nope, wont connect via bluetooth (even though it shows connected), keeps getting a Data type error. Extremely disappointing. The fact the tech guy stated its not an unusual problem was rather alerting.",1
1,"My Versa 2 gives me all of the information I need to stay on track. It's comfortable to wear, even to sleep in. I also like the way it looks. The display is easy to read as well.",5
0,"The heart sensor failed after a year. I’ve reset it and tried all the troubleshooting to no prevail. I ordered 2 of these, 1 for me and 1 for my wife. My wife’s is still going strong. I would look into a different brand had I know.",1
1,"Anybody looking to lose weight, this inexpensive watch works well, also if you work in the heat, watch your heart rate to se when to take a break.",5
1,I ended up returning it because I couldn't connect AirPods to it. Other than that all the features worked great. Went with an Apple watch instead,4
0,"I spent months going back and forth between Fitbit versa 2 or Apple Watch. I finally decided that I really wanted the sleep tracking that Fitbit offers. Welp... apparently I can rack up 500+ steps just from driving my car or just sitting in a meeting... also, I used an app “sleep cycle” along with the Fitbit sleep tracker, and was really disappointed overall. Not accurate on step counting and definitely not accurate at sleep tracking. I don’t recommend if accuracy is your goal.",2
1,Syncs great with the iPhone 11. I had a Samsung galaxy 7 and it did not function any messages or calls like it claimed. But the iPhone all features worked flawlessly.,5
0,For the price it should last for more than a year and a half.,2
1,I have owned the charge HR before and I loved it. My only complaint was the band irritated my wrist. So I stopped using it. When I saw the versa two hit the market with interchangeable bands and a wide selection of them. I had to jump on it. I was searching for a fitness tracker for a while. So glad I decided to get one. I also got one for my husband,5
1,"Love the fact takes only minutes to fully charge. I was down to 20% charge, put on the charger then took a shower and got ready for work (about 45 min) and watch was fully charged",5
1,This was a perfect Father’s Day gift for my husband. He loves being able to track his steps and his sleep time and he’s learning all new things in his app! Great gift!,5
0,I bought this Fitbit in January 20/20. I have called for support I get walked through the same thing all the time and they're not replacing it. I am paying extra for the sleep notifications. My Fitbit Versa stopped showing my text messages and I've gone through the reset with them so many times I want to bang my head against the wall.,1
1,I love this Fitbit,5
0,"This is my last Fitbit ever (and I’ve had 5). the heart rate sensor works on and off, and the app bugs you for location permission every time you open it. I’ve ha it with Fitbit - stop shipping crap and taking peoples money.",1
0,"We liked the face size and the number size. The actions were fine. The bands are as weak as wet tissue and on top of that, the company does not stand behind the guarantee of the replacement of the bands. The wide band torn like wet paper while my wife was moving a box.",1
1,Love this watch. Love how the GPS is so accurate. Would rate higher if the Bluetooth connection worked better for text messages and calls,4
0,"Right off the bat i noticed the supposed “upgraded” display is horrible. Much more pixelated than my original Versa. The colors are muted and dull. The screen looks proportionally smaller for some reason. Not happy so far, was hoping for better.",2
1,"Band is better than the charge, but Still uncomfortable if you are a side sleeper or stomach sleeper. Comfortable for day wear. App works well as long as you aren't running multiple apps at the same time.",5
1,"Tells time, heart rate, steps, calorie burn AND so much more. (I don’t have to open my phone to check the weather). So many cool features I have yet to try. Very happy with it so far!",5
1,Great fitbit! This is legit and mine has worked great for years.,5
0,It stopped working after 4 months. I thought it was the charger... I got another one. It charged for one week and now its dead again. i am sorry I purchased it from Amazon.com,1
1,Love my Fitbit!!It helps me gauge how much quality sleep I’m getting... I keep track of the calories I eat in the app and I watch how many calories I’ve burned while exercising.So far I’ve lost almost 20 lbs in 6 weeks using my Fitbit Versa 2!! Love it!,5
1,I was just getting used to it and the recall came out on this watch,4
1,"The Versa 2 is a good activity tracker. I wasn’t too fond of the implementation of the always-on display. Custom watch faces could not take advantage of this and it brings the battery life down to about 2.5 days. Hopefully they will open this up to developers in a future SDK release. There is potential here but I ended up returning it and getting a Garmin Vivoactive 4, which is a better fitness watch and looks much better on my wrist.",3
1,Everything works very well besides the sleep tracking for me. Not sure if I am wearing it wrong but it cannot tell when I’m sleeping. Other than that I love it and would recommend it!,5
1,I love this,5
1,I love the style it works really great for my sleeping to keep track my steps the floors that I climb the only thing I dislike is that the battery life I have to charge it up every three days,5
1,My new Versa 2 is wonderful. I have a huge wrist and the large band fits well. The diaplay is clear and crisp with many downloadable faces. Steps and activities works well and displays nicely.,5
1,This is my 2nd versa and I love it. More exercises to measure and Bluetooth for phone and messages,5
1,I love this watch. The only downside is it doesn't do blood pressure (as I have high blood pressure) even though my unbranded one had that ability and was pretty much spot on with what the nurses at the hospital do.,5

1,"Love my Fit Bit watch!! It tracks your heart rate, steps walked, sleep and much more. It is easy to use and with the app gives your your progress on several different things at a glance!!",5
1,Works good. Like the design. Seems to accurate. Good info for tracking and reaching goals.,5
0,This Versa 2 has never worked correctly and I would never recommend it for anyone. Will think about getting the Apple product.,1
1,For the price this is a great watch. Got this for myself as replacement for blaze that died. Was reluctant to go back to Fitbit but the price got me. So far so good. Battery life is awesome.,5
1,I love the style and the long battery life. I have many options to personalize my watch. Sometimes it doesn’t automatically sink with my phone but when I manually sink it works just fine.,5
1,Versa 2 is slightly bigger than the 1. I like it. Seems basically the same as the 1 as well and I was very pleased with it for many years.,5
1,"This watch and app has several things on it, I keep track of my food and water intake, it lets me know how many calories I have left for the day, how many steps I have taken, and lets me know how I have slept.",5
1,"The first one I ordered for my husband only worked for about 2 weeks, the replacement has worked properly since. Replacement was very easy.",5
0,It worked for a few months then stopped receiving text messages. It’s been three months of frustration tried everything under the sun Fitbit offers no solutions try a different brand,1
1,Love my Fitbit Versa!! Reminds me to move and keeps track of all kinds of things!! I still have lots to look up and do. Keeps me working on my health!! Plus LOVE the color!!!,5
0,"The watch performed exactly as advertised until its 14th month of ownership. Now most everything still works, can still charge battery and synch with the app BUT the screen on the watch is blank so the watch is now useless. Online trouble shooting has not helped but has confirmed that this is a known problem with the Versa 2.",1
1,"To sum it up DISAPPOINTMENT!!!the Face popped off!!!! Less than a year...Return window closed, so if you purchase get the insurance just saying...Good luck.",3
1,"I had a versa Fitbit, it finally died. I was not sure if this one would be to big. Not, fits perfect.",5
1,Fits well and feels good on my arm.,5
0,i WAS NOT ABLE TO GET IT TO WORK .........,1
1,Very happy,5
0,I thought about purchasing this watch for months because it’s pricey for what I typically spend on a watch- I bit the bullet and bought it. I loved it for a year then my watch completely died. It won’t turn on and it’s charged. I’ve tried everything including re starting it so many times I lost count. I’m so disappointed :(,1
1,"It is a great motivator when you are trying to be more active. Love the ability to set different clock faces, easy to use apps, and looks great on the wrist. Seller has been very accommodating and quick to respond to an issue I was having.",5
1,"Tracker has a nice display, and the Versa 2 has a very nice appearance. The newer software has changed and no longer allows a person to have more than one tracker on the Fitbit account at a time. I had purchased two Different Fitbits, but sent one back due this Fitbit software account issue",5
1,I really enjoy my Fitbit versa to watch however the band caused a terrible irritation on my wrist and it is now discolored.,3
1,"I wonder why the technical / design geniuses' at Fitbit decided to revert to pins for band removal-change. The Iconic band change clip on/off was great. Now us old techies with arthritis have to struggle 20 minutes to accomplish this once easy task. This is a big design flaw. Otherwise, the Versa 2 is a reasonably good upgrade for functionality.",4
0,"This was a Christmas gift so only used for 3 months. The battery lasts anywhere from 1-4 days, no reason why it changes. The time only showed with a wrist-turn for 30 days. Sometimes it doesn't show despite pressing the control button repeatedly",1
1,Got it for my husband for a gift I have the fit bit Vera light now I’m upgrading love it,5
1,The only charger that works with the latest model is the one that comes with it. Any charger from original Versa will not work.,4
0,"I'm a big fan of Fitbit versa v1. More than 2 years without any issue. The version 2 is metal but scratches so easy. Less than one month, many scratches.Don't buy it!",1
0,Worthless piece of crap. This is 2nd versa 2 since August2020. First one quit one week before year was FITBIT provided zero help. Said there no repair facilities. Junk,1
0,Does not work on Samsung Note4 Android phones. Need Android 7.0 or better to work.,2
1,"I love this watch. I use the alarm daily, and the timer frequently. It keeps track of my fitness, it's attractive, and it's comfortable. I do feel as though it overcounts my steps.",5
1,"Comfortable and does a good job, though one model before the faceplate did come off, killing the unit. I would recommend better checks of the faceplate and body due to that.",5
1,"I don’t like that I can’t reply to texts, but I have an iPhone and knew this when I bought it. I love the watch. No issues at all. I love the lock feature. You only have to put in the pin code once a day and when you take the watch off. So it’s easy but super secure. Well worth the cost and a great alternative to the more expensive ones.",5
0,"After less than 2 months, the side button no longer works and the touch function also stopped working. It continues to monitor my steps and sleep patterns, but I cannot see the time when I want and cannot change the functions on the watch.",1
0,I loved my Fitbit when it worked for the first 2 months. All of a sudden after some software updates the battery won't last longer than 7-8 hours when it could last 3-4 days just before that. Fitbit has no repair center because they make their watches to be thrown away. I found a company that repairs these watches and they want almost the cost of a new watch to replace the battery. So disappointing after I had fallen in love with this device.,1
1,Works great. Steps counting much higher than actual.,5
0,breaks within 0.5-1.5 years.Love the app interface.All models fail within this period.Been fitbit user since dec 2014,1
1,Wife absolutely loves it! It helps her keep track of her activities as well as her digital information!,5
1,"The problem is a waterproofing, it stopped working after 2 weeks regular swimming in a pool. Seller exchanged it for a new one, but I take it off before going in the pool. Another thing, they changed the app interface and it's realy ugly. Previous one was nice.",4
1,Love this watch. It is my second one. My first one was the original Fitbit versa. I broke it in a cruise. Total my fault. So as soon as I got home I order versa 2. So worth the money.,5
1,"It had more features than I expected. It generally very utilitarian, and the statistics are personalized and fun to look at. Also, if you are worried about damaging the screen, it's actually pretty resilient. I've been meaning to get a screen protector, but I've been accidentally bumping it against all sorts of stuff and doing construction work with it. Not a scratch or dent this far.",5
1,"I use mine at work, to communicate with coworkers, I love how simple it is to use my Alexa with it. I wish it recorded stairs better, that is my only complaint?",4
0,I have one which has worked perfectly for well over a year. I bought this one for my wife and it has stopped working after 7 months of use.,1
1,This Fitbit Versa superseded my expectations of the quality. It has been very reliable and functional in my active lifestyle. I would encourage you to try it for yourself and write your review.,5
0,"Overpriced for what it does and doesn’t do. Should have got an Apple Watch. It never sends my texts, no calls for my iPhone, navigation it klunky...maybe I’ll give it to my husband he isn’t very tech savvy and may like it",2
1,"So much better than the Alta. I'm all about this device. It's nothing fancy, but I love that I can download music onto it and go for a run without my cellphone. Durable and holds a long charge. A great tracker.",5

0,I bought the versa one then the versa two. Both stopped working correctly after a few months.,1
1,"I love my versa 2. It has a screen that’s colorful and easy to read. Fits comfortably and tracks my activities and gives me easy to read Stats each day from the previous day. It is Alexa accessible and I like that. The soft vibrations throughout the day help me see my progress, or lack of in some circumstances, and keeps me constantly realizing that I need to get up and move. I’m very happy with this watch. I recommend it highly.",5

1,Love it,5
1,Battery last quite long. Loving the alway on feature so I can check the time. I don’t really have any complaints. I don’t take in water to be carefulUpdate : freezes during an update,5
1,I bought this for my daughter at Christmastime with the warranty and so far so good! She's 16 and revolves her life around the watch now. I'm keeping my fingers crossed because it got a lot of very bad reviews!,4
1,Love all the functions of this watch. Like having my messages and phone calls routed through the watch to notify me of them when my phone is not close. Like all the additional apps that are available for it too.,5
1,Love my Fitbit versa 2 watch. It really keeps me accountable for everything I do as far as keeping in good shape.I wish I could listen to music on it without having to pay for a membership.,4
1,"3rd one, don't use in Hot water. Killed one doing dishes and one in a heated pool. So, only water resistant in cool water. Also gives false steps if you move your hand a lot, like raking or digging. Otherwise, easy to use app and syncs really well.",4
1,"So excited about my new Fitbit. Only had it for a couple days. So far, so good. I can't wait to play and learn more about it. Plus the extra bands are great.",5
0,Stopped working correctly 6 months after purchase. This is the second one I've had problems with,1
1,"I was hesitating to spend that much on a tracker watch, but I love this fitbit verus. Especially for exercising and walking, it does a lot of things that I haven't even tried yet. very easy to charge unlike the old version of the fibit hr, would definitely recommend .",5
1,"I wear all the time. I want to walk at least 10,000 steps a day and this helps. There is so much more it could do I need to learn but technically challenged",5
1,Ease of display and tracking features,5
1,"It takes a while for the sleep information to update and for the information you enter on the watch to pick up in the app. Id say the max time it has taken is 45 minutes. Other than that, I absolutely love this watch.",4
0,"Stopped working after 4 days - terrible replacement process through Fitbit directly... I ended up returning it through Amazon and getting an Apple Watch. I liked it before it stopped working. My Apple stuff has always worked, so I went back!",2
1,I loooove my Fitbit!! It is very accurate on steps and heart rate! The mobile app allows you to track trends and is very helpful when exercising!,5
1,"The heartbeat and steps feature were most important to me. The calories burned and Alexa were extra nice features on the device. Question whether the steps are 100 percent accurate but on a daily basis provide a comparison. Overall, good performance and the weekly overview is a nice feature.",4
1,I like the look. I enjoy tracking my exercise daily because it gives me incentive. Easy and fun. I’m happy I bought it.,4
1,"Love it, easy to use and tracks everything perfectly",5

 I bought it on December 23rd and it's been a month since these lines came out. The video clearly shows that the watch is well-groomed, not even once dropped. Such a branded and expensive watch should not have such flaws!Hopefully Amazon will respond accordingly and help me solve this problem.",1
1,"I like the awareness this device brings to my daily routine. I have gone from being a very active 8th grade teacher, constantly walking, to sitting at the kitchen table, teaching in front of a computer. The Fitbit reminds me about moving every hour and I have chosen to track my eating habits because it is so easy with this watch. I have an issue with the band causing a slight rash, I may order a different one",4
1,"I have gone through 2 watches due to the face coming off for no reason after less than a year. It was replaced immediately 1st time. I decided to upgrade to Versa2 & hope this lasts more than a year. Both were awesome, accurate, easy to sync w/my iphone. Battery life is great & that’s why I stay w/Fitbit. Hopefully this has a longer life.",5
0,It does not work. Stays on down load the app. It will not do anything,1
0,"I loved this watch that was delivered 8-29-20. The BATTERY DIED on 11-1-20. I took it locally to have the battery replaced and they said ""We don't touch those type watches."" YOU DON'T GET THIS INFORMATION BEFORE BUYING.",1
1,"Love the sleep tracking but doesn't always work. I really dont thinknits accurate when it comes to the steps either, I've looked at the watch while walking and the steps weren't recorded. They strap made my skin itch and peel so I had to buy new ones. Beside that, it's ok.",4
0,"Could not get help from Fitbit, usless, the watch is not even display the functions and everything I see is a different language.",1
1,I didn't realize that it would not be compatible with my Samsung J 7 sky pro phone.......so now I either return the fitbit or buy a new phone......still thinking of which route I am going to take.,5
1,It's beautiful. I wish it would sync better with my phone. The least thing will separate them.,5
0,"Not what I expected like the Charge better if what this offers could go into a charge I would buy. Notification or calls never come thru, can't sync apps easily have to load everything on phone and hope it carries over to Versa",2
1,"Love this Fitbit! Using it to monitor weight and activity in coordination with Nutrisystems. Easy to figure out, easy to use. Pretty too—I got pink to match my phone. 😊",5
1,"I love this Fitbit. I’ve never owned a real one, only ever cheaper ones. This is way more helpful and tracks so much more. I love that it tracks calories burned throughout the day (even at rest). I know it’s not 100% accurate but it’s a wonderful tool to keep you active and hitting the goals you set.",5
0,Battery became non-functional after a few months (cannot charge),2
1,"I can't be 100% sure of it's accuracy when it comes to calories burned and steps in my world cinerio. Bumpy roads make my floors and steps count incorrect, but I'm now turning my watch off to compensate for it. I love my watch and all I get from it. Glad you guys popped it out. Thx",5
0,Purchased Set 2020. The watch already does not work! Will not hold a charge and does not operate the functions for which it was purchased and as advertised! Very disappointed and am pursuing the warranty! An expensive mistake!!,1

1,i am so pleased with my fit bit. its helped me loose 14 lbs. so far.,5
1,"Excellent, well made, fine product. Replaced wife's earlier model. well worth the upgrade.",5
1,Battery life is short I've only had mine 3 weeks and I barely get 2 full days out of it. Fully charged in the morning by 7pm I've dropped almost 40%.,4
1,Love this watch soooo much! Improved from my versa and I'm obsessed with the band and they give you extras. Very pleased,5
0,"We liked the watch, It was unsafe. It made burn marks on my adult disabled son.I tried to enter the picture but was not able to.",1
0,Product battery died within a month of purchase. Seems to be a themes for Fit it devices. This was third time replacing one. Newer model batteries don't seem to last and cannot be replaced.,2
0,Would not sync with Samsung Galaxy S10+. Had to return it. When trouble shooting with Samsung I was told to wait for an update! Not for that kind of money,1
1,I bought this for my daughter. She loved it so much she even kissed me. Now she knows how much calorie she burns going up and down the stairs. One day she was pulling the weeds and was amazed how many calories she burned. I am going to order me one also.,5
1,"I’ll cut to it, looks nice out of the box but the glass scratches very easily my wife and I both have these and the faces are both scratched up pretty bad. I’d definitely suggest buying a scratch guard for this. Also get some cloth bands because if you wear the silicone one to long, even with proper washing, you’ll start to get a rash. The charge is good and so is the tracking. Hope I helped.",3
0,Pretty but could not get it to work returned item,2
1,Fitbit support has a lot to be desired. I walked away from this product because of poor support.,3
0,This item is nine months old and has already malfunctioned. It will not sync to the phone any more. It goes thru the discovery and connection process randomly and says it's connected but not. Upon reading numerous blogs and forums many people have experienced issues with this product concluding that this is a defective product and I am wondering if the manufacturer is offering a resolution for this defective device.,1
0,I've had my Fitbit Versa 2 for about 6 mos and the battery doesn't stay charged for more than 8 hours. I've followed all suggestions from support and nothing has resolved the issue. Reaching out to seller to see if I can get an exchange.,2

1,Muy buen producto,5
1,I love my watch it’s not the first one I have my only problem I can’t get Alexa to work properly,5
1,Bought this for my wife for Christmas -at her request. She loves it. Does so much more than her original fit bit. Easy to set up and use - saying a lot as we are very much seniors.,5
0,This will stop working in a year for sure. Had to buy because my daughter insisted. $25 would more justice than this watch,1
1,"I love the features of the watch and they have just added the spo2 monitor. It's comfortable, responsive and attractive.",5
1,I've had it for a week and so far I love everything about it. I upgraded from the HR Charge. Im enjoying learning all the gadgets.,5
0,All of a sudden the battery started lasting less and less until it didn’t last more than 1 hour. I don’t know if it came with a defect but I want my money back or the warranty since it was within the year. Also you cannot claim the warranty through amazon. Im so mad.,1
1,"Really like all its capabilities and apps. It's been very useful from making shopping lists, to tracking my movements to even controlling the lights in my home. As far as tracking steps is as good as any other wrist tracker. Don't like that it counts me brushing my hair as steps tho.",5
0,"I loved my Fitbit and used it religiously. But the screen popped off NINE DAYS after the warranty expired. They’re cheaply made so if you do get it, get the extended warranty. Really disappointed.",1
1,"I am pretty much satisfied with the purchase,but on different apps the weather doesn't synchronize. I don't know if it's versa or the app.",4
1,"This is a great watch and fitness tracker. I love the options available to change the watch face and truly personalize it. The battery has a realty long lifetime and it only needs charging once a week, if that.",5
1,"My favorite Fitbit yet, and I've had several over the years. It tracks very well and just keeps getting better. The sleep tracking is really helping me get better sleep.",5
1,It's amazing. Simply put. I have a samsung Note20 I couldn't voice to reply on texts but after downloading google messages I can even talk text now. I'm obsessed and so is my fiance with hers.,5
1,"No complaints, love it! I’ve had the Charge as well and of course this is even better. Love everything Fitbit. Wish I could sync my iPhone to it to text back but that’s an Apple refusal rather than Fitbit.",5
1,Very nice product and pleased with service from fitbit with setting up. I would recommend it to others. This was early Christmas gifts to myself. Very pleased.,5
1,"I kove it!! Big screen, bright colors, connects easily to phone, battery life last long.",5
0,"The watch worked great for about two hours. Then it malfunctioned and stopped working. I sent it back immediately, and it’s taking forever to get a replacement. I’m very unhappy, and I should’ve just bought this item in stores.",2
1,Perfect. My favorite fitbit and watch. Battery lasts a long time. Apps are easy to use.,5
1,"The fitbit itself works great but anything to do with the apps and linking your phone together is complete garbage. Constantly losing ""sync"" connection between the two. Spotify app rarely works and Alexa doesn't work at all now. Not sure if it's the app, watch, or just an issue in general but of course nothings is done to fix it.",3
0,"The install halted half way through and I can't get the damn thing to restart. Lots of folks on the internet had same problem, noone had a solution.Bought my wife a $30 smart watch that she loves.Hey fitbit, ship your product with an active OS and improve your installation process. Waste of $$ and time",1
0,"Totally disappointed with this watch!!! Stopped working after 6mths. Performed the factor resetting steps, didn’t clear out my data which was a good thing, but didn’t fix the problem. Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn’t, most times doesn’t work. Also have to keep re-syncing watch with the app. Thinking of going Garmin this time, but not sure which watch would be best/closest comparison.",2
0,"Was surprised that the watch did not have Alexa outside of USA and UK, I think!Also sometimes i would feel it vibrate which means there are notifications but nothing shows on the watch.",2
1,"Works as described. I work at a physically active job and was curious as to how many steps I took in a day. Of all the black friday products I bought this year, this watch was the most fun.",5
1,This is a great option for smart watch….battery last for a long time!,5
0,"Latest update bricked my Versa2. I'm assuming it bricked everyone else's, since the support backlog is a mile long. Returning this POS and going to try a Garmin.",1
1,I have had great experience with this device. The more time I play with the options the more I learn that I have access to information that I want and need.,5
1,Pairing it for my music was a hassle. Also the band has to be tight on your wrist in order for it to count the steps correctly when I wear my watch loosely it doesn't count the steps at all.,3
1,Like it,5
1,I love my new fitbit versa 2. I have only had it for 3 days so I'm not sure on the battery life yet. But I love all the features. I just used the treadmill setting and it worked great! Love how it tracks my sleep too.,5
1,I really like this watch. Battery life is great. App has everything i need in it. I wish there were more basic displays. There is a lot of displays with way too much going on on them. Need more basic clean looking ones...,5
0,Too many issues with this watch. Both my husband and I have it with different cell phone models and the watch has constant problems with syncing. I still can't get my email on the watch and Fitbit pay won't work. I have spent too much time using Fitbit support to try and resolve our issues. This watch is not worth the aggravation.,1
1,"I've had my versa 2 for about a month now and have been loving it! It's super easy to use, comfortable to wear and helps me to stay focused on my fitness journey and goals. Though the smartwatch features aren't that important to me, I do enjoy them.Highly recommended it!",5
1,"I wish the main button on the face was on the other side. Other than that, it's a great fitness watch and tracks a lot of information. Didn't think I'd like to wear it when I slept, but it's light enough it doesn't bother me. Love seeing my texts and emails on the watch too.",5
1,"I had a Fitbit Surge previously and recently upgraded to a Fitbit Versa 2. Very pleased with the features, the app, and watch like style! Very happy with my purchase.",5
1,Only complaint is I cannot get it to sync with my weight watcher app. Very frustrating. Been in contact with Fitbit and WW but no luck.,3
1,"I got this to replace my Charge HR that had a broken charging port. I'm really liking it, even though I don't use alot of the functions. But I know they are there if I want to activate them.",5
1,I am so in love with my Fitbit! The app helps me stay accountable and on track. Beautiful design and easy to use.,5
1,"I wasn’t sure if I would like the Fitbit, but I love it. I like tracking my sleep patterns and knowing how many steps I have taken. Great watch for the $$.",5
1,"I got this for my boyfriend, absolutely loves it and uses it all the time. This is his first fitbit so he was excited. We used the expanded band which was great.",5
1,Works well. Sleep tracker is a little odd....breaks up from day to day at midnight.,5
1,I am happy to have another Fitbit since my last one pooped out on me and the warranty purchased with it is a great deal!!!,5
1,I love my new Fitbit! I love the way that I can choose different clock faces to make it work better for me. It works great for checking my activity and keep me moving through the day. Except it won't track if you're using a stationary bike.,5
1,I have versa one and I bought my best friend a versa 2 loves it so much I bought one for me,5
1,Use it to track exercise and sleep a. So far I find it to be of good quality and works well. The only problem I have had is changing between 12 hour time and 24 hour time cycle.,5
1,I love my FitBit. I’ve had FitBits for over 6 years. Originally purchased it to track my sleeping and saw all the other great things it can do. I highly recommend purchasing one!,5
0,It was great while it worked! This is the second time I have had the same problem with Fitbit. My first one was a Versa lite and this one is a Versa 2. They both stopped working/syncing with Bluetooth about 3 or 4 months after buying them.,2
0,"Ive used fitbit for years now. It is a watch, a health tracker- but twice I've had them simply break. For an item that can cost as much as $400 that's BS. Just know that the quality is not always matching the price.",1
1,purchased as gift.. my sister loves the watch...,5
1,I really like the versa! The tracker motivates me to get moving and walking every day!,5
0,I don't get the idea. Only thing it does over the $40 watches is talk to alexa...if you're phone is in your pocket not in the next room. They were good about refunding though.,1
1,"NO ADVIERTE QUE NO TRABAJA CON ALGUNOS DISPOSITIVOS CELULARES, NI SUGIERE REVISAR COMPATIBLIDAD",5
1,The only issue is there are sometimes connection issues with the bluetooth to the phone and I dont always get my notification to my watch. The firmware updates have made this significantly better. Otherwise it is a perfect active smartwatch geared towards fitness goals.,5
1,"Es bueno en la monitorización del sueño, pasos y ejercicios, pero muchas de las aplicaciones por no decir todas son de paga al igual que las esferas o caratulas de reloj.No se conecta con el smartphone y cuando lo hace no es por mucho tiempo, lo que impide que le lleguen las notificaciones.Cuesta que se conecte con la PC (Windows), es decir que es casi imposible que lo haga para la trasferencia de música",3
1,The battery does NOT last 4 days .. I have to charge it every two days ..,4
0,I disliked the support I received when I had an issue after a year and a half. Watch states I have to add Spotify Premium. Everything works but main screen with time and daily data. Cost is $9.99 a month. Why now ? Never got a answer.,2
1,"I love it. Cute, sturdy and I love the reminders to get my steps in. I love that it also connects to my phone and I can receive calls and text",5
1,I was looking for something that would track blood pressure and steps and so far this has worked very well,4
0,"Works okay. The battery life is good. But to be truly honest, it's not worth the money. It doesn't perform much better than the $30 no name I started out with.",2
1,I gave wanted an Apple watch for a while but could not justify the cost. I found this watch to have a large enough face and the functions I was most interested in. I love it!,5
1,This product does so much more then I thought. It's great.,5
1,"I had a Charge 3, it never worked properly. I love the Versa. Frequently, the sleep tracker doesn’t track immediately.",5
1,Love this thing. Has all pertinent info available at a glance and large enough for an old guy to see. Easy to understand also.,5
1,My daughter loved this!,5
0,This product was sent back. Track phone refuses to update the system from operating system six to seven. We talked to Samsung j3 Luna pro and tracfone. Neither would talk to each other.,1
0,"This is the 2nd watch and it is not working right, either. The swipe for text or apps rarely work s now. I missed my window for return by a day.",1
1,Love my fitbit watch.,5
1,I’m so bummed… I loved it! And overnight it stopped. Quit working.,5
1,Wear it all the time. I like the step tracker and sleep tracking.,5
1,Wear this watch daily. Great for monitoring steps and workouts. Really wish it had more features similar to an Apple Watch.,5
0,"Lo compre como regalo a mi esposo llego usado sin los sellos de seguridad, la bateria le dura a duras penas 1 dia, no logre devolverlo porque lo compre enviado a un p.o. box y me sale mas caro devolverlo al suplidor que quedarme con el, compre un versa 2 edicion especial de amazon para mi y lo recibi en perfecto estado su bateria dura hasta 3 dias, eso si los dos marcan los pasos manteniendote el dia completo estacionario🤦‍♀️.",1
0,I tried the Fitbit Versa-2 several times over 2 days. It read about 20 BPM higher 90% of the time. I tested at idle and while on the thread mill. I compared to my Oxygen Monitor which gives readings same as my Cardiologist .,2
1,"Love my Fitbit my problem is it fell of my wrist while walking, the little band that holds the wrist band was Missingit must have broken off and I was not aware of it.please let me know how I can get another replacement, Thanks you.My e- mail is myrnaallston@ Hotmail. Com",5
1,Comfortable to wear easy to operate and fun to use. I would Recommend this product!,5
0,"Had the watch for 18 months. Taken pretty good care of it, but today it stopped working in the swimming pool. Got it home and water began coming out the back any time I applied light pressure. Definitely NOT waterproof!",1
1,"I was led to believe I could get emails, texts and phone calls because the watch could employ proximity blue tooth connections I have been disappointed to find out this is not true.",4
1,Teen really likes it.,5
1,OMG I really like my FITBIT. Helps to keep me on track. Thought it might be a little big for my small wrist but it fits and looks very nice.,5
1,This is a big improvement from my charge 2. I like all the new features and apps.,5
1,Bought it for my 14yo daughter for her birthday. She really likes it. It seems to be as close to an Apple Watch with similar functionality for and Android phone but the price is much better.,5
1,"I like the way it fits, it’s not heavy, doesn’t sit super high off my wrist like my first generation Apple Watch. Alls worked well with it except for the sleep tracker. Definitely not worth the price but it’s nice.",4
1,"love my fitbit versa 2, the screen is perfect size and i love the new colors and features you can do with it.",5
1,"Very preliminary review after 1 week of use - great product from functionality stand point. Already see some light scratches / scuffs on the glass after light use, so wonder how it is going to hold up over time.",4
1,Keeps all the necessary data at finger tips and makes it easy to keep healthier lifestyle in current covid environment.,5
1,"Love it! Would definitely buy again. I bought one for my daughter and grand daughter and they love it too! Works great and compared to the Apple Watch, I would have to say this one is better!!!",5
0,"My nephew, a software engineer, and I, a professor at a college of technology, tried to get this to work using one phone and 2 computers. Could not get the tracker to do anything beyond the original screen telling us to download an app. Waste of valuable time and money to realize this product was a dud...Only bought it as it was on sale during Amazon Prime days...junk...",1
1,"I have had an Apple Watch, and prefer my Fitbit Versa 2. It’s a better value for what you get, and at the price point I’m not scared to wear it daily to work, and workout.",5

0,Stopped working after swimming.,2
1,"I wear one all the time. Great feedback for exercise and, particularly like the sleep function. Keeps me on schedule for great sleep.",5
0,"I’ve had this watch for a year and four months and it dies quickly, doesn’t charge well and randomly shuts off. I’ve read similar complaints online after updating the system, which leads me to believe it’s intentional by Fitbit. AKA buy a new one .It was good while it lasted.",2
0,"Will not stay connected to my Samsung galaxy s7. Called customer support and they pretty much said that there is an issue connecting with Android and since they were aware of the issue, they can't do anything about it. Returned it for another, same issue. Will never buy any fitbit product again. Hopefully with Google buying them out they get a reliable product and decent customer service.",1
0,My versa 2 worked for 2 months without problem. I have rebooted it twice due to trouble syncing and the time was never correct. NOW..... I cannot sync or bring up the versa 2 at all. What costly a disappointment. I wish I would have read reviews earlier.,1
1,"Sleep tracking and accuracy ,it is accurate you see how your heart works all at your wrist",5
1,Gift for non-technology wife. Easy use for her. Lots of functionality. She loves it and seems engaged in using many applications. Helping her live a more healthy life style.,5
1,Great for tracking sleep and steps. Does not always connect to Alexa. I need more experience using it. I had a Versa for 2 years which I was happy with..decided to expand..,4
1,"I absolutely love this smart watch. Its brightx beautiful, and works like a charm. The setup was extremely simple and integrated with the iPhone 11 flawlessly. I really enjoy the sleep feedback, and its provided me enough feedback to question why I'm sleeping so poorly.",5
1,"Nice for this price, excellent pairing with android phones, recommended",5
0,"I'm hoping there is a warranty with this watch, because my husband wore it for two weeks, and it just stopped working. We tried plugging it in to several different outlets, but nope...nothing. I think we received a dud.",1
1,"It's been about a month, and I really like my versa 2",5
1,"I like this Fit bit,it allows several watch faces including pictures. I bought a metal band to go with it in rose gold,goes perfect.I've had it two months...so far so good",5
1,Very impressive watch. Love the sleek look blue is my favorite color. Looking forward to seeing how it holds up with my daily routine.,5
0,I was loving my fit bit versa until I got burnt on the wrist from the fit bit. I replaced my fit-bit charge with the fit-bit versa and had no problems with the charge 2. I will not be purchasing a fit bit versa again.,1
1,I absolutely love my fitbit! Ive had it for 6 months now and it is very accurate and looks really nice. I love the watch faces you can download.,5
1,I purchased this mainly to track sleep. Battery life is fantastic. I’ve recommended it to several people and have loved the benefits of having it.,5
1,"I’ve had a Fitbit for years and they are great. I don’t need it to have all the bells and whistles like the Apple Watch, I just need fitness tracking and this is the king. Long battery life, water resistance, and enough functionality to help with productivity.",5

1,I got this for my wife's birthday. I don't think she has removed it since. Ha!,5
0,"The touch screen stopped working, all I have is a fancy watch face. What an expensive POS. There is no fix for this. And since it doesn't work, I can shut the effing alarm off. Trash.",1
1,"Although some features feel like they are still in ""Beta"" mode, such as inputting food or sometimes, even the sleep feature seems off-there are times when I am not sleeping, but at rest and it's counted as sleep. This is confusing with meditation as well. Overall, very happy with the product.",5
0,I bought my fitbit less than a year ago. It won't keep a charge. I have to charge it every day and by the end of the day it is dead. Called fitbit and they said I have to send it in and if they find a problem then they will replace it. I paid extra for the 3 year extended warranty. I think a fitbit that doesn't hold a charge is a problem.,1
1,"I can’t imagine life without this watch! It has helped me meet so many goals. Works great, syncs well, and app is easy to use.",5
1,I love this watch so much so sleek and very nice looking. My husband liked my so much I boght him one. Thank you,5

1,"Device worked great with my S8. Now that I upgraded to the S10, I can no longer receive text messages. I can get phone calls, emails, calendar reminders, and FB messenger messages. But not texts. Very disappointing. Other than that, it does everything else it should and I'm happy.",4
0,"Sorry but my first impression is very disappointing. I put it on my wrist, because it's a watch, tap the screen or push the button or swipe up or swipe down and all I see is a beautiful black screen. Nothing else. Glad I didn't buy one for my wife for Mothers Day.",1
0,"Screen is unresponsive after two and a half months. Performed multiple factory resets. No dice. I did like this watch when it worked, but to break so quickly is disappointing.",2
1,"I like the whole thing. It does way more then a cheapie, and the software is great.",5
1,The kids both loved their new fit bits. It does so much more than their older ones.,5
1,Gave this to my son in law as a birthday gift and he loves it.,5
1,"Love the cor, very rugged and easy use to connect to all devices.",5
1,"Great product! I have had 3 Fitbit wearables over the past several years and this is hands down the best. The heart rate tracker during workouts is comparable to my chest strap monitor. I deducted one star because it has a tendency to slip in and out when tracking my heart rate during weight lifting type exercises, which affects the total calories burned during that workout. Pretty irritating, but overall a great product!",4
1,"Nice watch and features. One issue, when I charge the watch, sometimes I lose the prior step count.",4
1,The 2 day charge is a pain.i wear it all day and night and I have too charge it every 2 days!!!!,5
1,Great product for just fitness..not very interactive with other apps. Doesn't connect with text or calls. Kinda boring. But it does track your steps pretty accurate,4
1,"Great functionality but I bought it as an added to my Ionic. They won't work together on the Fitbit app. Also I always have problems with it's accuracy on stride & sleep when they are new. Otherwise it's light weight, cleaner look, and longer battery life.",4
1,This is so great,5
1,Love it! Works great. Keeps a charge for a long time. Haven’t charged in 4 days and still at 40%. Band is really nice. Also like the gold vs all black watch. The sleep tracking is my favorite thing.,5
1,Battery is draining quick. Has same problems versa 1 did. With quick view off it always turns on out of no where. Step count is still off big time. Barley counts steps on an elliptical. But if you roll over in your sleep it will count as a step,3
1,This does everything I wanted it to. I run it through my Android and the text response and everyone is top notch.,5
0,"It came today and I find out the watch the strap was ripped, Also I had another strap, but it's a large size so I can't use it. :((((((( soo sad!!!",1
1,Love my Fitbit Versa 2. Upgraded from a regular Alta with no HR. I have noticed a decrease in battery life but i think that may be due to the HR that I have with the Versa.,5
1,"Very comfortable with lots of features. So many different watch faces , I just love this smart watch!",5
1,❤️❤️❤️❤️,5
1,"I do like the device, but don't like that several features are dependent on a Premium subscription. Fun clock faces, but most are now have to be paid for as well.",5
1,"Heart rate tracker is a bit off, and the step tracker could be better. No matter what I do, it resufses to cobnect to the internet so oh well to the Spotify feature.",3
0,I thought this was suppose to have a battery life of about 7 days. Mine is only lasting 2-3 days ☹️I was upgrading from a Charge 2 since it was a Prime Deal but considering sending it back!,2
1,I've had this for about 5 months. I had some trouble getting it linked to my phone but now I couldn't live without it. I find the notifications to be super helpful so I don't need to grab my phone every tme it dings. I like tracking distance when we take the bikes out.,5
1,"As a technology-challenged woman, this works great. Alexa, music, etc. is optional, I choose not to use it and I'm extremely pleased with this product.",5
1,"I received this less than 24 hours after ordering. This is my first smart watch and it took a bit of getting use to, but it works perfectly at keeping up with my health and important messages.",5
1,I never understood the hype with fitness watches until I got the Versa 2. It is a great health tracker and a reminder to get up and move each hour. Its become a game for me to meet my daily goals. Great fun.,5
1,It does exactly what it says it will. Love it,5
1,This is my favourite of all the titbits I have owned. I really like the Alex's part because I can verbally reaping to text messages and set up reminders and timers.,5
1,"I liked this watch and overall it was pretty accurate, but it was pretty bulky on the wrist. It also takes a little bit of practice to be able to put the watch on by yourself.",4
1,I like the look of the watch and the touchscreen. The text and call notifications glitched out after a few weeks now wont work at all. The heartrate is not that accurate on my bike rides.,5
1,"I have one, love it and bought this one for a birthday gift",5
1,"My girlfriend loved her gift, nice upgrade from previous versions",5
0,I got a replacement Versa 2 to replace my versa under warranty and right after the year was up the screen went blank and Fitbit doesn't want to cover it under warranty. They won't stand behind there product,1
1,I cannot program this to accept my text messages; every member of my famliy has tried to no avail. Seems like I am charging it quite often.,4
1,The watch is well worth the price difference between itself and the various knock offs on here,5
1,Purchased for my wife for Mother’s Day and she loves it.,5
1,"The steps counter, the days I don't do a lot of steps, I can sit in a chair and tap my feet 👣 on the floor and this count as a step",5
1,The talk to text feature is just amazing. I'm discovering all the lovely upgrades from my original Versa. so far I love it!!!,5
1,Love that the watch shows the time all day. Just wish the charge lasted longerVersa 2,4
1,"I love this little thing, makes losing weight somewhat fun. Kind of like a game. The only thing I did not like about this is that I paid to much. My fault for not shopping around, but make sure you check Walmart because it's cheaper there. See it for around 150$",4
1,So I had gotten this for myself but my husband convinced me he needed it for his birthday. he hasnt taken it off since lol very accurate and he loves it.,5
0,Between the swipe feature going out on a regular basis and the whole thing malfunctioning every six months. It's NOT worth the $!,1
1,"My Versa just stopped working after almost 2 years, so I had to have another, but an upgrade. The Versa 2 is amazing, I am still learning the different features, but I love it so far",4
1,So far everything has been great. I have no complaints. If I had to say anything about possible improvements it would be that I could send a text or FB message without it being a reply.,4
1,"I've only had it a week and everything seems to be working fine. No issues I saw an article about needing to reset if not working up to par, Fitbit is aware of the watch's shortcomings. So I'm cool last this time.",5
0,not great beyond tracking steps. apps created by third parties are just for looks (i.e. strava app doesn't let you record activity in the watch).,2
1,"Bought this FitBit in December 2019. By February 2020, I’m done with it! At first, it worked great. Now, it won’t receive notifications, sync works sporadically, and now it won’t even respond to touch on the screen. I’ve tried everything from restarting it, to forgot the device and re-syncing, to even a factory reset. It’ll work fine for a little while and then stop working again. I’m done with FitBit.",3
1,"I’m 53 and need reading glasses to see. The screen is so big I can see it without glasses! Def plus!!! I was concerned when I was jogging my heart rate would be higher than it should be. So, I put on my old Fitbit, charge 2, to compare and the versa was way off compared to the charge 2 but only while jogging.. every other activity the heart rate was the same..🤔",5
0,I must say. I really wanted a Fitbit and I am very disappointed. It continuously knocks me from the Bluebooth. It always doesn't sync. I cannot have more than one device paired.,2
0,"Purchased Versa 2/Fitbit to upgrade from smaller style. Versa 2 worked great for at least 3 weeks. Then it stopped keeping time of day accurately. Then everything seemed to implode. Love it for 3 weeks. Changed out wrist band to leopard print, put a bling edged encircled cover on it loved it. Now hate it.",2
1,"Only thing I don't like about this watch is that it is too big and bulky"" and I thought from the picture when I ordered it that it wasn't this big in size because I have a small wrist, I was going to return this but I think the time has expired!",4
0,"I bought this versa 2 for a Christmas present and about five months in it wouldn't keep time so I wrote and asked for advice each time got a tech with advice that did not work the last one said to clean it with alcohol with a brush, I finished and the face has fallen off. I would like a replacement or for it to be fixed.",1
1,Sleep sometimes not accurate and Alexa does not stay connected. Would get without Alexa next time. I do love having a fit bit otherwise i need the reminders.,3
0,"I cannot believe 2 out of my 3 fitbit have damage the same way, the screen just falls apart! I thought it was my fault with the versa so I ordered the versa 2 which is waterproof, to be safe i even took it off to shower and never really used it in water, never the less the screen falls off! I've had this watch for 6mths and that's it! Basically trash!",1
1,"great item, battery last a good time",5
0,"3 miles on my elliptical NordicTrack said my heart rate was 145-151, Versa 2 said it was 97-104.",1
0,The charge doesn’t hold for more than a few days. The battery runs down faster than the Fitbit Versa 2 sport,1
0,"I got it on Jan 18 and within 11 days it wont even turn on. Put it on the charger before I got in the shower, still had 50% battery life, and poof. Broken, that wasnt worth the money one bit. I'll be getting a full refund.",1
1,I thought it would connect to my phone it will answer it but you can't talk. Bummer especially for what I paid for it.,4
1,"I have had my eye on this for a long while and finally broke down and bought it. I absolutely love it. I can track my sleep, my calories, and my water intake. This smart watch is so versatile. Charging is a breeze. I just put it on the charger while I am in the shower and it can easily jump 20% in a 10 minute period.",5
0,"Siempre voy a dormir a la misma hora, y cuando cambiaba el.modo Sleep este en algunos dias no tuvo registro de horas dormidas, tambien las notificaciones cuando queria las daba o ya despues aparecian cuando aun no las leia.En todo lo demas super bien, alarmas workout tracker",1
0,This only lasted 7 months and it went haywire. I think you should make this good. There is no way this should of broken this soon. I took very good care of it and its screen just went lime green. Can you tell me why? I will not recommend this to anyone if you cant replace it free of charge!,1
0,"I've had the Versa 2 for 2 months and up until recently had no issues. A few days ago, the screen randomly stopped working. Pressing the button on the side wouldn't ""wake"" it and the only time anything on the screen would show up is if I slid it the left (so still not showing the clock feature but I could get the shortcuts to appear). However, trying to click on any of the shortcuts would result in it blacking out. Returning for a replacement and am hoping this next will last longer.",2
1,I'm loving this watch. I don't understand it all yet but I love that it helps me track steps etc. I love the sleep app. Very interesting.,5
0,"The media could not be loaded.
 I have not had my Fitbit for a year yet and this has happened. Very disappointed!",1
1,outstanding.,5
1,Bought this because was having so much trouble with ionic but this one lighter and even has alexia if you use that but I love all the band options for this Fitbit,5
1,Hoping they improve the Alexa app portion. Takes a lung time to get a response... says thinking a long time. Half the time Congress back with no response. Otherwise a great watch.,5
1,When I contact Alexa sometimes it doesn’t connect. Needs work but it’s still good.,4
0,I bought this because my blaze quit getting text messages. This one will not receive messages either. Does NOT work with newer iphone. Customer support sucks,1
1,good display.,5
1,She likes it and that was all that matter.,5
1,Given as a gift for Christmas. Person enjoyed watch,5
1,I was already a fan of fitbit. This was an upgrade for me. I love that it looks more like a watch but stills does everything I want in a fitness tracker.,5
0,I was very dissatisfied with my Fitbit versa 2. I had to subscribe to a premium service to get all the services. My 3 year old phone had more options and cost less with no monthly dues. And it does not have a find phone key.,2
0,"Bought for my wife’s birthday, very excited about the product. Spent 2 hours trying to connect it to the Spotify app, didn’t work. Spent time on the phone with tech support from Fitbit and it still wouldn’t work. Delivered today, repackaged today for tomorrow’s return. Very disappointed with the product. Will not buy again. I recommend you don’t buy this product.",1
1,"This is a welcome upgrade for me, i had the charge hr 2. I love this watch and all its features.",5
1,"I absolutely love this fit bit, had to replace my inspire so I thought I'd try a newer version, the band is kind of thick, so I bought newer ones and they're on their way.",5
0,"purchased to replace older fitbit, set up was fast and easy, my versa 2 froze on 1 screen, went thru trouble shooting and called support, very helpful, went thru reset process and watch never did reset, fitbit said return to amazon the item was defecftive. will purchase another and try agian. in mass production defects happen, not angry just a little disappointed. only lasted 3 weeks.",1
0,So dissatisfied I sent it back.I didn't know you had to purchase apps to use it.,1
1,Screen scratches too easily. Scratched within the first week or two of where. Battery drains pretty quickly.,4
0,"Ordered this in December 2019 and had no problems with it until the screen adhesive went bad and the screen was dangling by two cables back in September 2020. Fortunately, it was under warranty and I got a replacement. Months later, the screen has come off once again and this time, the warranty has expired.",1
0,"I was really liking the versa 2. And was planning to buy the latest coming out and give the versa 2, which I got July 11th to my sister. But August 29th. Without warning. Wemt totally black and will not turn on. Nothijg is working.Will call them and see if they can suggest what happened are a way to fix it. But really little over a month old.",1
1,"Like it a lot, grate Christmas gift. I thought it was not going to make but it did just in time for my flight, I was going on vacation. I call Amazon they got it done!",5
0,I loved all of the features but it stopped working in April and I bought it in December. I called the fibit customer service and they were super nice the quickly replaced my Fitbit. Sadly by October it is wasn't working again. I didn't even try again.,1
1,I love my Versa 2. I've had it 3 months now and no complaints at all.,5
1,"Watch, heart rate monitor, spo2, auto-tracking of exercise, women's health trackers and more.",4
1,"Customer service with Fitbit is replacing the item which is appreciated, but, this was a birthday gift and I feel horrible that it didn't work. Luck of the draw I guess.Now, bought a second one for myself. Very happy with the service on the first and love mine.",4
1,"I love this device! It's easy to use, it's accurate and it monitors everything that is important to me. Plus the Bitmoji clock face is fun!",5
1,What I like the must is battery life! Don’t have to charge daily as Apple Watch.All features are practical design to provide accurate fitness information.,5
1,"This watch, while stylish and seemingly well-built, suffers from frequent and annoying connection issues. I will update my review if they're fixed, but I'm not holding my breath.",3
0,"It’s a horrible product. I bought it recently and in less than 2 months, i cannot charge it. Please don’t buy it.",1
0,It was working well at first but I’ve had to replace 4 fitbits now. In the end they don’t connect on Bluetooth and malfunction shutting off and on randomly. This was the worst investment for the past 2 years. DO NOT get fitbits.,1
1,Like it and needed to measure my daily activity. Easy to use and is basic enough for me. But it does have options I don’t use right now. I turned off my email syncing to it because I’m using it to help de-stress.,5
1,"I thought this was a good fitness tracker, however I returned it to get the updated versa 3. The main difference between the two is the built in GPS in versa 3, as well as improved charging port in the 3.",4
0,"I have only had this watch for 2 months and already have to call the customer service 3 or 4 times due to the notifications not working. I have tried trouble shooting, etc. and it has not worked. After calling FITBIT, they said they do not know when it will be fixed and they do not give refunds based off notification issues. I explained that the whole point of this watch is the notifications and if I wanted a regular watch, I would have.",2
0,Changing bands is impossible and can’t put original band back on. Needs charging more often than my Fitbit charge 3,2
1,I like everything about this band. For the price it's a really good deal. The only issue I've found so far is that the bands are a little difficult for me to change.,4
0,Fitbit won’t hold a charge. : (Trying to get Fitbit to exchange.,1
1,Item was of the most rad quality. Matchless packaging. Very peerless delivery. A+,5
1,"Product was delivered on time with no issues, the watch was in perfect condition and ready to go. Synced up to everything with no issues, easy peasy!!",5
0,Does not sync with iPhone 12 mini after exhausting many attempts. Will return.,1
1,This is an excellent Fitbit! It does everything I need and extra things. My only problem is it keeps losing the wifi signal and then I have to keep setting it up again and again.,5
0,I like everything about it.,1
1,Very great product very accurate readings highly recommends purchases,5
1,"This product seemed harder than the last model to get set up. once it was setup worked as previous model. Previous model had given up for me, but had served a long life. Great deal of the day purchase price.",5
1,What I'm happy about most I got such a deal on this watch and I wear these type of watches everyday.,5
1,"24/7 heart rate monitoring, accurate calorie burn, battery life and sleep tracking.. had an Apple Watch and it lacked all the above.",5
1,Upgraded to this Fitbit after my Alta stopped holding it's charge and wouldn't sync or send notifications. Super happy with this watch!,5
1,Bought Mother's Day. Had to reset 2x to factory settings due to failure to sync w/app (phone). Has this issue w/FBit2. Will not get another Fibit. Too much of hassle.,3
0,"I had this product 6 weeks past one year. I was in bed and the face came off. I’ve used Fitbit for a very long time. All of my other watches lasted much longer than this one. If I have to purchase one every year, I may as well buy APPLE! Very disappointed.",1
1,"I love this Fitbit as an upgrade to my Charge. The only issue I’ve had is with the arm band falling apart. Apparently, if you carry a lot of things around (including kids) and it gets caught a few too many times it will easily damage the arm band.",4
0,Button stopped working,1
1,"I had an iwatch for 5 years, it recently shattered after a fall. I needed that tracking so I decided to downgrade to a fit bit. Definitely was NOT a down grade. Love the product for the price!!",5
1,"This works well for tracking sleep steps and exercise, but I would like to know my heart rate when i am not at rest or exercising. Just during normal daily routines",4
1,This has helped me to stay on top of sleep and certain other health issues.,5
1,Love it. Only problem is the charger only worked once.,5
1,This watch is amazing. I Love all the features. Keeps me active.,5
1,"Love most features. Fitness tracker is awesome! But, at times difficult too use. Can't remove apps I do not use. Instructions on how to use not clear for those not IT savvy or young. All in all good product though.",4
1,"Absolutely love my versa 2! I finally upgraded after almost 7 years with the original fitbit lol. It tracks my sleep l, to what I feel is pretty accurate & my workouts. Great to monitor heart rate also.",5
0,DO NOT BUY !! Bought Fitbit surge watch 7 months ago went dead ! Then after taking 3 weeks to get back to me. They want to give me another without a warranty ! So now when this one goes dead in less then a year No wrranty so I have No watch ! Save your money buy a Apple watch. I was hoping Amazon would take this back But No help,1
1,Wish the sleep tracking would pull up the full night oxygen level numbers. But like the this and glad I got this one with the large face.,5
1,"Love this tracker/watch. Purchased a band that better fits my personality but also compatible with the versa 2. made this a perfect fit. I have compared with other devices as I walk with friends and found to be very accurate. My only want, the oxygen reading that I read was limited release. I would purchase again.",5
1,My band was broken upon arrival. Getting a new one through Fitbit is harder than returning to amazon for a new device.,4
0,"Besides all the stuff they say it does but doesn't, it's useless if you have to bend over backwards to sync it everyday.",1
0,No entiendo por que hay que comprar otra cosa si ya compraste tu reloj y tienes que comprar suscripción para las apps?Noooop mejor me quedo con el Samsung Active 2,1
0,"After 14 months the watch doesn't display anything but time though it is tracking steps which I can see on my phone. The reset button on the side doesn't work. I bought insurance, now if I can find it. Next time, an apple watch.",2
1,"This Fitbit has many great features, the Alexa app is amazing. I had the Fitbit Versa and loved it, didn't think they could add more features but the Versa 2 has much more. It came with a special addition woven band and an additional band, best of all my bands from my Versa can also be used on my Versa 2!",5
1,Best smart watch ever. My wife loves it. Works amazing. Beautiful color too.,5
1,Love how easy this is to use. And gives so much info. An unexpected perk is the notifications on my phone...an extra bonus!,5
1,Bought in November 2020 and face has come apart,3
1,Wish you could reply to a text with an iphone with this device. For the price a basic fitbit is better value since this doesn't do much more than the original one did at a much smaller price and I got this at Black Friday price.,3
1,"Good watch, works well, battery can last almost a week.",5
1,"The watch is comfortable has has a beautiful, readable screen. Alarms work well, as do notifications. Battery life is advertised, uses about 10% per day. The tracking measurements are as good as any device, mostly accurate, but not quite as gym equipment. Very happy with this watch.",5
0,"This was a nice watch, and the features were fun. However, the GPS tracker, and exercise monitor were very inaccurate. Running a route one way was 3 miles, but backwards was less than half that.",2
1,Nice tracker and is exactly what I expected. Get cover so you don’t scratch. Easy set up battery time is very good. Usually I charge every couple days.,5
1,"Delivered almost a week early! Only had 2 hours so cant comment on mych, but set up was a breeze",5

1,Very durable and well made! Love the rose gold with purple band.,5
1,"I bought this watch for my daughter for Christmas, 2020. She just called me and told me it came apart while she was walking today. She said the pin fell out and the strap came apart. I'd like to have it replaced. After all it is less than a year old.",4
1,Wife loves it!! Setup and instructions could be better.,5
1,I guess I thought my text notifications would show up... they don’t. Also no blood pressure check.Super disappointed,3
1,Love the Fitbit Versa 2. Glad they finally made it to be compatible with more phones. I bought it because it did with the phone I use.,5
1,Sleep tracker is highly inaccurate! So much so its useless. It says I'm asleep when I'm not.,3
1,After trouble shooting for several days this device will not display text or calls. I am returning it. Other wise a nice watch.,3
0,Lens falls out easily and finally shattered.,2
1,I do not know how to set it up. It tracks my steps & gives the time. I really like those two things. Wish I could figure out how to use all of the features.,5

0,Had the watch four months and stop working no refund or anything buyer beware it’s more trouble than it’s worth,1

0,"The versa 2 is nothing special. I've had problems updating right out of the box, cant connect to my spotify account, and cant get messages on my phone right now. I wouldn't recommend this watch to be honest. I''ve had this watch for about 6 hours and its still trying to update, Its bringing me nothing but frustrations.",2
1,Bought for my son and he loves it. I already had one and absolutely love these trackers.,5
1,"We upgraded from a previous fix bit (flex) to the Versa 2. Not a huge learning curb, works, and looks great. Now we both have one. :)",4
1,"Should've bought sooner. Works great, batter life is amazing, app is easy to use. Easy to set up.",5
1,"I have used a fitbit in past but never a versa , I do love these products although I think that any bump does calculate as a step other than that I have no complaints.",5

1,"Overall i like the purchase the app doesn't work properly, it takes a lomg time to sync. Sometimes i have to refresh it several times and also it blacks out from time to time even though it is fully charged. I wont be able to get the screen to come on until i place it back on the charger. I dont think i will be purchasing any more fitbit products. My sister has a different one and i purchased mine on her review. She loves it and has had it fir years with no concerns.",3
0,This Fitbit came out the box in another language. I have been unable to sync to a new phone. Right now the device is not in English. This was supposed to be gift for my elderly father. To help him monitor his heart rate and steps. It’s been nothing but problems.,1
1,"Love this watch! Very accurate, durable and comfortable!",5
0,"Had to charge daily or every other day. I had to pull out my Charge 3 (which I can wear up to 2 wks before charging). I'm not sure if I received an old exchange, but returned",2
1,"I m 91 use it for miles bpm sleep, etc",5
0,After 5 months my watch has somehow lost a minute in time. The band doesn’t hold up well either. I’m not impressed with this product and do not recommend it.,2
1,So far so good. Still trying to figure out everything it does. Scary how well it tracks my sleep. Steps will always show more than actual number but close.,4

1,I love my Fitbit. Have been using a tracker for years and this is my most functional.,5
1,I do a lot of walking. My Versa keeps me motivated to walk at least 3 miles a day. I lost 30 pounds last year and my Fitbit Versa was my reward.,5
1,It keeps me eating right by tracking what I eat. Easy Peezy.,5
0,"This watch just looks pretty. As far as functioning goes it takes long time to set up, it would not connect to my wifi. I had a hard time syncronizing to other apps like spotify or even alexa. For a 200$ watch you are pretty much buying a watch with a nice design. Thats about it.",1
0,this fit-bit versus lite 2 has not worked properly since i go bit out of the box...I bought it for my husband for Christmas and was the worst mistake. I have not had anyone to help me and i am a long time fit bit user... please help,1
1,"Love it. Bought two. One for me and one my husband. All data easy to read. Updates, charging, using very easy and has mostly anything you need or want on a watch or tracker.",5
1,My wife wanted notifications from her iPhone and health & wellness apps. Also the long battery life. Beats the i watch for her needs. She loves the black band. I gave it to her as a gift. She’s very happy with it.,5
1,Difficult to use with SpotifyAmazon didn’t have the best price,3
0,"The fitbit has stopped working. I purchased it the beginning of January and it will not display the time and steps any longer. Waste of money. Because this was ordered on Amazon, I don't have an order number from fitbit to be able to use the warranty that is good for a year. What a totally joke.",1
0,"This fitbit is not ready for prime time! So many bugs I cant count, loses bluetooth constantly, now not recording sleep or exercise unless manually entered. Have tried every reccomendation from fitbit tech. Nothing works only new problems. Had the fitbit charge for 2 yrs, never a problem. Watch looks nice and band is a definite upgrade, but having to reset Bluetooth 5 to 10 times a day is horrible",1
1,"Love this watch, very accurate and comfortable. Love that I can change straps quickly and easily when I want.",5
1,Working great. Couldn't be more happy with the purchase.,5

1,I really would like Device that give BP and blood sugar.,4
0,"This had been great, but only a few months after, it has been vibrating for no reason. I have been reading in how to fix it, I've force restart, I've tried to check all notifications. It's so frustrating. It even goes off for no reason in the middle of the night and wakes me up! Ugh. I had really liked it but now it's losing value.....",2
0,It is so hard to link it with anything. And then you cant get rid of messages on the clock face. I would like to tell time.,2
1,"The actual watch itself is fine, does everything great and more, BUT I feel that I have to constantly sync my watch with my phone just to go into any app. It will say “please sync your watch with the Fitbit mobile app” and this can happen multiple times a day.",3
0,I gave Versa 2 to my Son in Law for Christmas. the screen froze up in April and he has not been able to get any help from Fitbit.,1
1,"Puede ser que sea por mi celular (Nova 3) pero las aplicaciones como Spotify anda mal, se desconecta siempre y cuando la quiero reconectar casi nunca me es posible. Antes usaba una una pulsera (miband 4) y nunca tuve este problema de la música.",3
1,Had the Fitbit Blaze before I bought this Versa and I love it. Better display and more interactive. SUrprised at the battery life lasting 4 days on average. Great unit.,5

1,Love this fitness watch. the sleep tracker gives good data. like the step counter and reminders to get moving. also like the feedback when you reach goals. very adaptable with color bands,5

1,I bought this for my husband's Birthday. He totally loves it! I have the same one with a pink band that He bought me for Christmas. Excellent product.,5
1,Lots of options to use! I recommend it??,4
1,I love the fact that it's easy to see in the sunlight and the screen is large. Not really sure about the sleep tracking that doesn't seem real accurate,5
1,It fits great. The cloth like band is super comfy and does not chafe like other bands do. It had so many cool features that will make your life easier. Battery life is fantastic 👏 👌 🙌,5
1,"I love my versa2, I had the 1st versa and had several issues, however with 2, I've had no issues and I love the additional features, I didn't realize how much I relied on it for my steps and heart rate until I didn't have it.",5
1,"Text messages are not currently compatible with iOS. I believe this is Apple’s fault but still, this is the primary reason I got this for my husband, so it’s a disappointment. It’s pretty big to be comfortable for sleep tracking. But it’s a great watch and has amazing battery life.",4
1,she likes it,5
0,"I was disappointed with the performance of the Fitbit Versa 2. First week, all was good but then I deveoped issues with notifications and then my iphone was not syncing with my car. Once I disconnected the Versa from my iphone begain to function properly. Thankfully, I was able to return my purchase for a full refund.",1

0,"My product arrived on August 5 and on September 4, after two days of charging my fitbit to 100%, the watch battery was down to 0. I charged the battery to 100% that evening, September 4, and on September 5 the battery was down to 20%. Of course, I have insurance, but what a hassle to go through the process. I am not impressed. What a disappointment.",2
0,"Battery doesnt last as long as it claimed, the unit didnt sink with the app, the unit only lasted a few months and its not worth the money. Not sure if I was just sent a defective unit or what; but very unhappy with the purchase.",1
1,i like how the numbers are accurate but i dislike that the band gave me an allergic reaction,5
1,I love this!! I upgraded from my Charge Fitbit. I love the Versa 2. Has so many features and is helping me keep track of everything.,5
0,Stopped keeping correct time after 10 months then froze up with a blank blue-green screen after only 14 months.,1
1,"I Love this!!!! I’ve never been so motivated to work out, and I like being able to track my hydration.",5
1,"I really like this watch. I do wish it had a few more features where text and phone are concerned. Overall, it seems to be pretty accurate.",4
1,"I have tested the watch for about 2 months. I’ve dropped it, showered with it, swam with it and it’s still working great! I really do love it.",5
1,"Good display, fitness tracking is helpful, sleep analysis is also good.My phone gives this message 75% of the times I try to sync - device not found.",3
0,This is my SECOND Versa 2 within a year. I had to have the first one replaced because it would no longer charge. I received the replacement the summer of 2020 and now the screen won't turn on. I checked the app and it's 78% charged but it just will not turn on!,1
1,Wrist band was super small not comfortable to wear,4
1,"Este item lo recomiendo ampliamente para que dure mucho tiempo y siempre se vea actualizado, lo recomiendo",5
0,"Bought it September11, 2019. The screen just went black and shows the logo. It appears to be dead.",1
1,This does so much more than I realized it would. I went from a Fitbit Flex 2 to this one and am so glad I did.,5
1,"Me encanto mi fitbit me encanta las aplicaciones de ejercicio que tiene, pero después de 2 meses de uso comenzó a desapareces el ritmo cardiaco, es decir al momento de estar haciendo mi ejercicio comenzo a marcar y desmarcar mi ritmo cardiaco no se que a pasado pensaba que era por actualización pero se actualizó y sigue con esa falla.",4
1,I really liked the watch/Versa 2 until 9 months when it completely failed. The face of the watch was only a bunch of lines and gray. Will see if the company comes through with a fix or replace. I'm waiting for an email as to the next step.,3
1,I bought this for my boyfriend and he said he loved it .He has never had a smart watch and he is amazed at all the features it has. He recommends this product,5
1,I love my Versa 2! I was able to set it up easy and I am not a tech person. It's very fashionable and accurate. I love how it reminds me how many steps I have left before the hour is up. I have not set up the sleep tracker yet so I can't give a review on that but I love everything else.,5
1,I bought this for my daughter for Mothers Day and she loves everything about it. She says she now wears her phone on her wrist.,5
1,App is limited for adding 2nd watch and migrating history from prior watch and then adding same to second family member.Sleep app not always reliable.,4
0,"I love this smart watch. The apps r amazing, the heart rate and community. Everything. But in really bummed. The step out is way off, like but 100's. I walk around 10,000-13,000 and this watch says 20,000-25,000. I move my arm and it racks up steps. How do I fix this?? Thinking of sending it back. Kinda useless If u cant track steps half accurately",2
1,"Bought the watch for my mother, who is an avid swimmer and was looking for a watch. Very handy apps and the linkage to Alexa. Having trouble figuring out what the Spotify does.",5
1,Works great - I love having access to my Amazon Echo!,5
1,"This Fitbit does everything it says it does, and if you get the PowerSync app, you can synchronize everything very easily to Apple Health.",5
0,If you use a iPhone they tracking info gets deleted when syncing to the app not worth buying they won’t refund you the money. Customer service is horrible chat gets disconnected before the problem is solved,1
0,If you have any other Fitbit devices then DO NOT BUY A VERSA 2! I got a Versa 2 and I also have an Inspire which I want to continue using. When I add the Versa 2 it deletes the Inspire. I talked with tech support at Fitbit. They said there is no work around for this. They should warn people about this. This is the 5th Fitbit product I have bought. I will never buy another.,1
1,"Gave this to my husband for his birthday. He loves it! He walks her dog many times a day and always walks over 10,000 steps sometimes 15,000 steps. He loves to keep track of his walking.",5
1,"I love the color of this product. Also, I have small wrists and it fits nicely and comfortable. The accuracy seems to be good though twice it didn't read my sleep with unknown reasons. My biggest issue would be the battery. I have to charge it every day and I just bought it a few weeks ago.",4
1,Upgraded from a fitbit charge 2. Get a weeks worth on battery. Only wear 5 days of week. Perfect for retrieving messages from my phone when busy with work,5
0,"No clear instruction, the watch doesn't connect to the app properly, always some glitches with data; the customer service tells you a piece of new advice and different from before. Useless",1

0,"Does not work with pixel 4Connection is unstable and is s known issueIt is being returned,and Fitbit customer service wasn't very good",1
0,It's been good up until a couple days ago when it quit syncing to my phone and I can't get it to work (I don't do a lot of crazy things so no severe damage besides regular wear and tear) so now it's basically a plain watch. Which is not what I bought this for and I didn't want to buy another expensive watch after a year.,2
0,Low Quality. Tries to be an Apple Watch and Fails miserably. Buy a regular watch or spring for an Apple watch. This smart is neither smart nor easy to use. They Charge extra for faces. Apple doesn't do that!,1
1,Xmas gift for the wife. Her first smart watch and she loves it. Wish it had more apps and features but it serves it purpose and was reasonably priced.,4
0,I really love the look of this watch but very disappointed on the setup I've had it for over a week and I still can't get everything set up very disappointed,1
1,Still getting used to the mobile app loving the sleep mode so much more to learn,5
1,"Really like the watch overall, only issues was within the first month of having the watch it stopped working. Returned it for a new one and not even a month later started to have issues with the microphone not accepting voice commands for responding to text messages or when using Alexa. Cannot get ahold of customer service for getting the issue resolved. But other wise a good watch and tracker.",3
0,Everything works great except for my text messages won't come through the watch. This is one of the main things i needed and is very frustrating. It was working but stopped working and now my return window is closed. Tried so many things and still nothing!,1
0,First one literally melted on the charger. Second one 3 months later is just dead. Amazon basically said go pound salt. 3 months! Don’t buy this stuff here! Go direct to fit bit! They have a one year warranty. Amazon 30 days with no budge. So ridiculous,1
1,"I had the Fitbit Charge 2 but it hurt my wrist so I decided to get the Fitbit Versa 2, I love it! It has more options like weather and Alexa.",5
1,I have been using a Fitbit for over 5 years. I love the Versa because it tracks all the important health matrixes. It has helped keep me on track for a healthy lifestyle.,5
0,"Heart rate is not accurate. Have to tap hard or in the ""perfect"" spot for screen to display.Poor instructions.",1
0,Face plat came off just while on my wrist sitting at my desk over a year after purcahse so it is out of warranty.,1
1,"The only complaint I have is the color of the band wasnt what I thought it was. It is more of a purple than a maroon color. Aside from that, I LOVE this watch.",5
0,I’m not loving it like I was really hoping to after spending so much on something. It’s not holding a charge for a whole day. I also noticed it tends to feel hot in my wrist sometimes when battery is running low. As a very busy mom of 3 boys to treat myself to something that cost so much it’s disappointing to have it not everything you had hopped for.,2
0,Connection problems!!! Google needs to FIX this problem ASAP!,1
1,Tracking my steps and sleep is 2 of the reasons I got my Fitbit also challenging my friends to reaching daily goals is a lot of fun.,5
1,"Was supposed to come on the 16th, got it on the 12th of December. VERY happy with the watch, I love changing the clocks faces and having all the options available. I haven't done much with the watch but I have a few friends and coworkers that love it.",5
1,I like getting texts on my watch instead of having my phone with me at all times,5
1,Stylish and easy to use. Really helps keep me motivated to exercise.,5
1,All the functions are fine but the screen scratches super easy. Make sure you order a protector.,3
1,No dislikes and very attractive.,5
1,So far I like it I haven't tried in the water that's the main reason why I got it so I could keep track of why swimming laps.,5
0,My watch will no longer update to the current time and date. I bought this watch in mid April and it stopped working properly at the beginning of July.,1
1,Well 2nd times the charm. My first one had some technical difficulties and wouldn't stay synced to any device. Had to just be a defective one because this one works absolutely perfect! I love this device and everything it can do! Thanks for quick replacement! ❤️,5
1,I LOVE my Fitbit! I recently got into working out and the heart rate is pretty accurate. I love that it tracks my sleep and calories. I got it for the purpose of tracking my calories burned.,5
1,Got this to update from an HR2 and happy for the switch. The screen has not broken or scratched and I hit it on the counter all the time by accident. The only thing disappointed in is it will track steps if patting nephew on the back or if I am jittery in my desk.,4
1,"Wearing this device reminds me to keep track of steps, monitor my sleep - and it helps alert me to my incoming phone calls and so much more",5
1,Had it for a couple weeks and the touch screen stopped working... had to call them twice. They finaly had me return it. It's been a week and still have not heard about a replacement,3
1,My husband bought me this as a gift to replace my older fitbit and I love it. It's nice to have while working out but also just in general. The color is very nice as well.,5
1,"A very good fitness tracker - good battery life, comfortable to where with an optional metal mesh band. Only need blood pressure to be perfect.",4
0,This product has too many issues.. the touchscreen goes out or it just stops working. My first one was replaced because it stopped working one day after purchase. I received the replacement and now the touchscreen has stopped working. Apple watch here I come.,2
0,"I LOVED it while it worked for the first 18 hours! Then, the next day when I woke up, it would not sync to my phone. When I called Fitbit, they say it's not compatible with my phone. WHY would it work perfectly for one day then not the next if it wasn't compatible??? I returned it.",1
0,Only worked a month then broke and I don't understand why. Just won't power up.,1
1,"Es el primer reloj inteligente que compro, me gusta Fitbit porque es fácil de usar y da muchas opciones y aplicaciones útiles en cuanto a tu salud. Tiene hasta un contador de cuanta agua has bebido.Es elegante, fácil de usar, la correa y el modelo es cómodo.Definitivamente cumplió mis expectativas.",5
0,Love this watch but it doesnt track my steps. One of the reasons i bought this watch was for that feature. When i looked up reviews before purchasing i didn't see this as a problem. I could have saved my money and got a steps tracker for less than half the price of this Fitbit.,2
0,Sent back. I dont like being sold to.,1
1,Takes forever for the text to come to my watch only thing that drives me crazy I get the text to late,4
1,I had the charge 2 and upgraded to the versa. This one is so much easier to use. The battery life isn’t quite as long as the charge 2 but it charges quickly. I like the stylish look of the versa.,5
1,"I really like this fit bit, but I don't like that you have to be a premium member to use the apps on it. I wear it everyday and it's not too big or heavy.",4
0,Ugh doesn't pair well with my android phone and cannot change the time. I've only had it 2 weeks.,1
1,Great product-shows you in detail how you are progressing. Very interesting information to share with your Doctor,5
0,I sent back the first one because it was defective and keep getting emails saying it has not been received over the past few days. I took this to ups store and just left it there. I can not get ahold of anyone because I don't know how.,1
1,I love my fitbit. It is very helpful amd has alot of apps. to use. Wish I could call on it. Over all I'm very satisfied with it.,5
0,"The distance and pace features started going haywire suddenly on 8/20. Distance, which I know is 1 mile now shows .93 mi. and pace, which was showing 12mi/hr now shows 17 for the same exercise. I am a very, very dissatisfied customer, as I spent more than I wanted to on the watch because I thought it would be better quality than a less expensive one.",2
1,It was a gift for my father-in-law. He loves it and all the features.?,5
1,"While it is a decent watch, I keep having to resync it everyday which is frustrating. The battery life is excellent though, which is why this was my choice in smartwatches.",4
1,I really appreciate the sleep tracking features with the device as well as some of the additional data tracking like the O2 intake overnight. I must say though that if you can try to get another band if possible. The band it comes with has really ruined my skin and I've scheduled an appointment with my dermatologist to look at options,5
1,Just as pictured,5
1,I gift fitbit's to my girlfriend every Christmas and she loves them every year. there is never anything wrong with her old ones I just want the newest tech.,5
1,I like it so far still learning some of the different features...,4
1,Bravo! This is better then my Apple Watch. Delivery came the day that it was ordered!!!! Kudos to this amazing product. The sleep app is great,5
1,"Step counter is all wrong, calories counter is all wrong too beside that all good it got the exactly the same problem that the other versa. This watch count steps when I am set and when I am sleeping so...",3
1,This was a gift for my girlfriend for Christmas and she loves it.,5
1,"I only gave 4 starts for accuracy because I don’t know how to compare, but I’m very pleased and love the Fitbit. Everything I need is in one app and tracking is easy. It’s so helpful seeing my daily Calorie input/output and it helps a ton that calories burned are continually updated. The mini goals have been fun and this app has helped me complete even small daily goals... even if it’s just walk a few extra steps and climb a few more stairs",5
1,Nice watch .. Bought it for sleep tracking and its not very accurate only tracks portions of my sleep sometimes,4
1,I’m sure the watch was great! But my wife couldn’t understand how to use it so we sent it back. In other words... the smart watch was smarter than my wife. lol,5
1,"A little uncomfortable to sleep in. Love the exercise tracker, and the breath pacer. I use them a lot. Love having spotify with me at the gym too.",5
0,"Battery life is terrible! If I could return it, I would. I don't use any of the apps so it will last longer but I still have to charge it every other day! Terrible, DON'T BUY!!!",1
0,Returned after less than 2 weeks because it stopped syncing. It was counting steps in my sleep. Not accurate at all.,1
1,Truly love the fitbit only complaint is that per the info and reviews the battery life lasts up to 4 days I have to charge mine everyday at least once,4
0,"I am fed up after weeks of trying to get the Versa 2 to sync with my phone. Will not show text or call notifications, play music, download music, etc. Will be returning this and purchasing a Samsung watch.",1
0,I purchased my first watch and it died 2 weeks after receiving it. Amazon replaced it quickly. My second watch died 10 days after the 30 day return policy. So I am out my money with no options! I have worn Fitbit for 5 years and never had this issue! Very poor quality!,1
1,I bought this to help me improve my health and track my steps. I am so impressed with the versa 2. I can also track my sleep patterns...which is very helpful to me.,5
1,"fantastic!. great size . Tracking is easy withfbiawatch. I am more conscientious of walking, heart rate andsleep patterns. I love it",5
1,"Fitbit Versa 2 tracks everything better than the old Alta version, highly recommend upgrading.",4
0,"Bought this in June and the hardware failed in October. Never got it wet. Had it in a protective case. Nothing could save it. Great software, terrible hardware. Buyer beware.",2
1,I love my Fitbit but I’m unsure about the step counter is valid. I move my arms a lot at work also walk so it counts my arm movements so I’m thinking my numbers are way off So if I’m not really walking it’s not much of a health benefit. So if I want to actually track my steps should I wear a pedometer also ! I do love that is sync with phone !,3
1,"Heart rate at rest and exercise, steps and sleep tracking.",5
1,Great watch but lense easily scratches..,5
0,Touch screen stopped working after 2 months - kept battery charged according to instructions - now its just a watch face and no.other functions,2
1,"I love the Versa2! Would love to have a bit more swim and water play accuracy, but otherwise it’s pretty perfect.",5
1,I decided to finally treat myself and get a fitbit. I want to keep myself more accountable and I felt like this would be a good way to start. I am so glad I did. I feel like I am making more conscious efforts to improve myself through out the day because of this. I bought one for my husband too.,5
1,This watch is great for Android phones but pretty worthless if you have an iPhone.,3
0,I’ve only had this Fitbit for 6 months and it’s already having connectivity issues between my iPhone and my watch. Would not recommend if you want to accurately track your runs/walks as it constantly gets disconnected and I have to reset it. The set up takes forever and it can never connect to my wi-fi even when it’s right next to the modem.,1
0,"Stopped working properly after a month. Ordered a replacement through fitbit 3/1220, still haven't received it. Very disappointing.",2
1,The mobile app is amazing!,5
1,I have steps on my phone and wear a pedometer. U can watch those track steps as u walk. U can’t w this and it gives me the least steps daily by MILES! Not good..it’s an expensive watch,3
0,"Even when adjusting the band for workouts like recommended I’m getting wildly varied readings. The watch is for the most part under reporting HR, not good if you’re trying to track calories.",2
1,So far very good,5
1,"I love my new fit bit, just a little bummed that it is now $50 cheaper than what I paid for it less than 1 month ago.",5
1,Seems pretty accurate and has some nice features you can download to your fitbit device.,5
0,Compared to the Iwatch it is not user friendly,1
0,It doesn’t do what it says it does you cannot initiate a text,1
1,I should have read the comments about how small the font was before buying this item. It is so small one can barely read it. I had a Fitbit charge 2 which had a smaller face and had no problem reading incoming texts. This is impossible. Very disappointing!,3
1,I bought this watch to more accurately track my steps and calories. I've been loving it. The fact that it's waterproof is great and I love the different clock faces and apps that you can install. I don't use it for sleep tracking because I already have a sleep tracker as part of my bed.,5
0,"DO NOT BUY A FITBIT VERSA 2, I AM ON MY SECOND ONE AND ITS STILL A PROBLEM EVEN AFTER THE COMPANY ALREADY REPLACED THE FIRST ONE. IF YOU BOUGHT ONE TO GIVE SOMEBODY RETURN IT NOW, DO YOURSELF AND WHOEVER YOU WERE GOING TO GIVE IT TO A FAVOR AND RETURN IT BEFORE YOU END UP IN THE MERRY GO ROUND OF CALLING THE FITBIT COMPANY EVERYDAY TO TRY AND FIX IT. I HATE THIS WATCH.",1
1,"What can I say? Fitbit is THE best tracker watch you can buy...at any price. This is my second Fitbit watch, my first being the HR. My Versa 2 is beautiful, accurate with sleep , heart beat, and steps. I love the features that remind me to move. At first I didn’t think I’d react to it, but I actually got up and moved. Fitbit...I love you!",5
1,"I love the Alexa features! I had a lot of the same features on my old fitbit, but Alexa is a great addition. I'm quite forgetful so the reminders are wonderful. Loving it so far.",5

0,"I was using the device 100% according user guidelines. After 3 months of usage, the touch screen continuously got disfunctional.. Reset and reboot it many times as per suggestions but didn’t solve the issue.. In parallel to that issue, the battery started go off in 2 days which used to be approx. 5 days.. This was my 3rd Fitbit fitness tracker watch and I’m so disappointed with the issues of my Fitbit Versa 2.",1
1,Works well a lot people say they can’t sync but it did for me immediately no issues whatsoever l.,5
1,love this but wish it came with more written instructions,5
1,I have turned off all the apps. As it drains the battery. I am having to charge the battery every 2 days Very disappointed!,3
1,I returned this item because the Fitbit watch was causing severe pain to my wrist. It functions great but the EMF or the slight radiation can be damaging.,3
1,"The fit bit works great, but the app to control it is very poorly managed and freezes a lot. It also takes a long time to sync up when you open the app, and once you change something it takes awhile for it to pass it on to the screen of the fit bit itself.",4
1,"I have been a Fitbit user for for many years. I recently decide to get the Versa 2 for my wife, liked so well that I ordered the same model dor me. We are both very pleased with the expanded functionality and how it looks.",5
0,"This the second Fit Bit watch I buy, not even six month and it’s already defective, this is the worst yet, can’t even get my money back, so disappointed the product",1
1,Love it! Only thing I have to compare it to is a cheap tracker I bought for 20$ on here to start with. Comparing to that it is so much more in depth of course. It definitely does the job! Very pleased!,5
0,Wish I could leave a worse review. It doesn't sync to your phone or texts. If you want music you have to download or pay for premium they fitbit even if you have an account . Not happy,1
1,"I'm pleased. Great reminders, love getting notifications of my text messages or whose calling! Challenges are fun, it's definitely got me moving more but I'm competitive. Without it, I was not moving much...",5
1,"I bought this for my friend, he liked very much. value for money.",5
0,I had the product for 2 weeks and then it just stop working only thing that it did was the logo pop on..,1
1,Incremental update over versa. Sam issues with HR tracking as previous model. Overpriced for what it is. Plus I need to pay monthly fee for sleep insights. Back it goes.,3
1,Que yego vien i cómo lo vi en las fotos al comprarlo gracias,5
0,This product is overpriced! Other places sell cheaper!! Also couldn’t change it to Hebrew language and that’s very frustrating .. should be international.Another thing is that this watch is supposed to be fast but it seems to have trouble shooting and getting stuck a lot .Very disappointed,1
1,Bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she absolutely loves it,5
1,Couldn’t wait to track steps,5
1,This is a great watch / Fitbit just paid way to much Costco has them for 139.99 so unhappy I was to dumb to look around before I bought two of these grrrrrr,5
1,Not able to change out bands due to all are too large for the opening,3
1,I love this new Firbit. The messages are clear. Sleep infornation is good. And battery life is appropriate. Love the style and watch faces. And I use Alexa almost everyday.,5
1,"I find the tracking of all aspects (steps, sleep,etc.) to be very accurate. I also enjoy the other apps interaction and convenience (Spotify, Alexa, alarms, timers,etc.).",5
1,"As with most Fitbit products, this one works great for tracking anything you want. My biggest problem is that, whatever the buckle is made out of, it is extremely destructive to sensitive skin. I had a Fitbit Charge 2 for about 3 years prior to this versa, and I never had this sort of problem.",4
1,It keeps losing its sync with my phone. Need to reset and install once a week.,5
1,very nice looking watch. Does everything that I am interested in doing. Seems sturdy.,4
1,"Worth the investment, got it for prime day and worked out amazing. Wife has one and now I have one better than apple in my opinion",5
0,I purchased on April 3. It worked great. Now it’s June 25th and the battery won’t hold a charge.,1
1,It works so well that it counts all my steps,5
1,"It has some syncing issues with the App. Only way to fix is to log off the app and back on. Otherwise it is nice, battery lasts about 4 days.",4
1,Bought for a gift works wonderfully. Lots of fun app's lots to keep you busy and inspired to keep fit!,5
1,The Fitbit does everything I need at more than 1/2 the price of Apple Watch,5
1,I’ve been loving my Fitbit! It has become my best friend in the past two months!!!,5
0,"This watch was complete and utter trash. It worked properly a couple weeks, then it started glitching out. This must happen to them a lot, because they gave me some work around to download different clockfaces. This somewhat worked for a few more weeks. Now it's completely dead. Terrible, terrible product. Do yourself a favor, buy anything else.",1
1,I love the Fitbit versa 2. The problem is connecting to my phone. I almost returned it but it is pretty awesome so I make it work.,4
1,I have Fitbit Charge and thought it’s time toChange to the Versa . I’m very happy with my decision.,5
0,"It is only as good as it lasts and it lasted 11 months. it has a 12 month warranty and will probably take that long to get this matter resolved. Oh, one more thing. Try the calling them selection. . . if you have a lot of time on your hands",1
0,Totally the worst customer service ever. Their product is defective. Great while it lasts but very short lived. They read a script and tell you policies and procedures without actually looking at the problem. Zero stars,1
1,I bought this as a gift to my mom. The battery lasts literally forever which is what my mom exactly needed. Thanks!,5
1,"Love it!!!! Keeps track of everything you need for getting into shape & play music while working out.I read some reviews stating music cuts off, not for me.Want to get in shape, this will cover it all",5
1,"Easy to set up. Like seeing the phone and text features. Love the sleep app, now I can show my physician what I have been saying..🙂",5
1,Love it! I didn't know I could talk (text) respond so that was a great surprise,5
1,"I got it for my boyfriend and he loves it. Very accurate, easy to set up, friendly app. I will get one for myself. Its not heavy and he can barely feels it!",5
1,"I haven't used it for sleep tracking, but I exercise every day and it helps me to track the amount of calories and # of steps as well as distance.",5
1,Good for starting to use these Fitbit. A middle of the line product.,4
1,El perfecto asistente en temas de salud y bienestar con su monitoreo de calidad del suelo y del ejercicio.,5
1,Works great to keep on schedule and emails and texts,5
1,"So far so good. No complaints at all. I am still learning about all its features. I love the fitbit app as well. Tracking my sleep and along with my steps and everything else, which is keeping me motivated. So overall this was a great purchase.",5
1,I like the accountability it provides to energize your efforts to stay on track for your goals.,5
0,Broken!!! Arrived dead. Tried calling customer support but no help!! They just said just charge it for a few hours and call back. Even tried calling amazon customer support for a refund but they even messed that up!!! So disappointed!!,1
1,The music as far as I can tell requires a subscription. Maybe I just haven’t tried it enough...,4
1,"Love the watch. I use Alexa with it, send /receive messages, fitness info etc. Great smart watch",5
0,This watch is garbage it won't connect to my phone and it's a hassle to deal with I'm bout to put the watch I paid $175 buck for on ebay....this was my first smart watch and the experience I had with this one changed my perspective on smart watches I feel like I truly wasted my money,1
0,Watch was delivered in January 7th and the last couple days the display won’t turn on. There was no water damage and I hadn’t been rough with it. Very disappointed.,1
1,Long battery and great product,5
1,I absolutely love this new Fitbit. It is stylish and there are so many accessories to dress it to match whatever is in store for me for the day. I have been tracking my food and water intake with the app and it is easy and convenient. I am finding new features almost daily. I am very pleased with this product!,5
1,"I’ve had it for about two months. I’m still Trying to. Navigate around it both on my phone and the watch itself. I’ll revisit my review if I figure it out. It’s easy to change the band once you get the hang of it. I like the size, but uncomfortable to sleep with so I usually take it off.",4
1,I love this watch! I'm new to working out and just wanted to keep track. No issues with it and I've used it for months now.,5
0,"I purchased the versa2 on Aug 17, 2020 from amazon. today it stopped working. what should I do?",1
0,"Terrible. After receiving this item, 4 days later the screen would not scroll. Item was replaced and two weeks later it’s doing the same thing. Cheap and not effective",1
1,This is the 3rd fit bit versa I have owned.give me all the information I need.,5
1,"I’m using it just for my steps, other futures are getting disconnected",5
1,"I bought this for sleep tracking, but I'm not too i.pressed with he apps. If you are looking for a smart watch you need to go that route.",5
1,The battery life on this device is horrible. After 2 days it's in need of a charge.,3
1,There are a lot of applications you can add to the watch.The ability to use your phone wallet and add bar codes makes it easy to leave the house without carrying anything.,5
1,"I track my daily exercise/activity. Haven’t used it for sleep tracking yet. It reminds me to move, and motivates me to get my daily steps completed.",5
1,Awesome Sauce,5
1,I have had a variety of smart watches and this is by far my favorite!! I love it.,5
0,This is my 2nd FitBit that got wet in the rain. It's supposed to be water resistant AND swim with it up to a certain depth. They BOTH both got wet by rain and stopped working within minutes. Totally not worth the money. My husband's cheap tracker works better than either FitBit2 or Versa put together! Don't waste your money.,1
1,I actually wasn't expecting this watch to be this good. So glad I ordered it. Easy setup and very accurate. I would definitely recommend this.,5
1,The tracker is great.The battery does not last as long as stated.But still good.,4
1,"I had been debating over purchasing a Fitbit or Apple Watch for quite some time. After really doing research into both, the additional cost was not worth it to me for what I was looking for in a smartwatch. I’m very glad of the decision I made and love this watch! There are even more features on it than I originally realized.",5
1,I am so liking this Fitbit phase 2. It seems simple and easy to use. I should benefit from it very muchEnjoy to myself and others,4
1,I love my Versa 2. I update from the Versa lite and I must say I love this Fitbit so much better. I do around 15000 to over 20000 steps daily.,5
1,Great upgrade from Versa one. In particular I love the voice reply to texts. (Android app) Overall it seems accurate and is very comfy.,5
1,Bought this watch for our daughter and she absolutely loves it.,5
1,Great gift and the customer service is amazing as well. I have heart palpitations so it helps to track it.,5
0,"I loved the versa 2 at first. I even bought my daughter one. Within a week it quit syncing and Fitbit replaced it. But sadly, I am allergic to it I guess. First I got a bump and then a hole in my skin under my watch. I even ordered cloth watch bands for it. But sadly I can no longer use it. It's worth the money if it doesn't cause your skin to be irritated.",1
1,Had a different smart watch before and this one is much better. Tracks my sleep and exercise well. Love this watch and the way it looks. Also like the non silicone band.,4
0,Alexa is spotty. Often cannot use it without refreshing my phone.Disconnects from phone several times a day.,1
0,This product is not fully matured. bought it yesterday. did the initial set up successfully. Then there was a firware update and that is it. It will not sync anymore. Alexa wont work. Spotify wont connect and this whole thing becomes useless. Fitbit/Amazon has to do major QA. I'm returning now.,1
1,Beware! I have had this watch since Christmas-(2 months) and it fell on the floor. Now the screen is compromised with lines running across the side making it unreadable. Fitbit does not cover this in a warranty. One would think that just dropping the watch would not render it unreadable. It just fell off a counter. Apparently you need to buy an additional warranty to cover such things as the screen display. Amazon customer service was very helpful,3
1,Very user friendly. Great way to keep track of fitness goals.,5
0,I have had my fitbit versa for about a month and the notifications from my phone etc. no longer go to my fitbit. They worked great for the first 3-4 weeks and stopped. Pretty useless if that was one of the reasons you wanted the device.,1
1,"Got this for my mom for Christmas. She loves it!! It came charged and sealed in the packaging, no issues.Edit: The first one broke after a few weeks but they replaced it for free and the new one is great.",5
0,"Worked great for almost a month, now the screen glitches and it does not recognize touch. Completely worthless at this point.",1
0,"not keeping a charge, won't update firm-ware, won't sync, now I have to waste time getting it replaced -wast of time pathetic junk",1
1,I have a versa 1 and now the much improved versa 2. I am glad I upgraded. Better screen and better battery life. Highly recommend versa 2.,5
1,"The only thing I didn’t like about this was the band. Within having the watch on for a month, the band was already giving me sores.",4
1,Good,4
1,"Particulate this amazon specific edition has got an elegant colour tone. Pretty nice to wear. Fitbit is doing great as compared to Wear OS. You won't regret this purchase, I believe!",5
1,I was really enjoying the FitBit Versa 2 until this message popped up. I have looked for solutions and it seems like everyone that has had this problem has ended up getting a new one from Fit Bit or not getting it resolved at all. I've only had it a little more than a month. So disappointed. Hope it can get fixed.,3
1,"I love the new version. The Alexa part does not work well for me, but I have echo dots all over so I really don't use it on the watch. Great battery life",5
0,"It has been less than a month since I purchased and the Fitbit Versa 2 already does not work. After days of attempting to resolve an error: ""Day not cleared Sync and try again"" I am left with many articles of others that have the same issue and no resolution. Do not buy this! It may work for a while but sounds like so many do not last long. This is too pricey for a paper weight.",1
1,"Still learning it, but in love with getting notifications on it along with tracking my activity. Been lost since my last one died",5
1,Motivates me to get moving. Very stylish and easy to use. Love the color and the price.,5
1,Omg I love mine!! One of my favorite so far and I have tried a few,5
0,"Loved it when it worked. Alexa quit working after six months. I still use the timer, stopwatch and workout tracking but really disappointed Alexa stopped. Ridiculous it broke after six months. Will not buy again. Chatted with Fitbit who didn’t fix the issue.",2
1,Great price..great item. Fast shipping!,5
1,Battery life is excellent 5 days,5
1,"I really liked it, but it would b to confusing for me, & don't think my phone is compatible, never wore it, so there's absolutely nothing wrong w/ it. Thank u",5
1,Its a great watch and well worth the money! I love it! Bought extra bands thinner than the one you get with it! Little thick for me!,5
1,Not easy to operate. Once setup and operation is understood it works as advertised.,3
1,Love the band color and the step tracking,5
1,"I was a little concerned about the comfort of wearing this comfortably, especially when sleeping, but I'm pleasantly surprised. The band is very comfortable and its reached a point of oddness when I'm not wearing it. Love this watch! Beautiful colors and versatile.",5
0,"I've had it since December 27th 2019, the past few days it hasn't been wanting to sync to the app and it completely unpaired on the app. I've had to charge it everyday without fail and I made a point to not have the setting that drain the battery turned on. To be honest if it wasn't a hassle to return it and get a refund I seriously would. I do want a refund though.",1
1,"I like it, but sometimes it’s not account the steps as I expected properly.",4
1,"Love the items available on this watch and love the fact I can got 6+ days before having to charge it. It charges fast and feels comfortable to wear, love this watch!",5
1,"Great smart watch! It's been great to see how well I sleep each night, number of steps, heartrate and more!! I purchased this for my mom and dad, too! It's great!",5
1,Love the watch. Good help from help desk. Only complain don’t think sleep tracker works well usually only shows a hour or two of sleep,5
1,The Fitbit versa 2 do not track blood pressure. It only tracks pulse rate. My $24 fitness watch track blood pressure all day and night with sleep track. I bought this for bit thinking I was stepping my game up. I was wrong.,3
0,Trying to install clock faces almost always fails. Known issues with no solutions on their help pages.Just not seeing the value in subscribing for $10 a month just to get the final metrics from the watch that I actually want. Would recommend a different watch without a monthly service fee.,2
1,"I love my Fitbit Versa 2!!! It allows me to stay informed at a glance! The time, my steps, music, weather, purchasing power, setting goals, receiving emails and so much more!!! The smart features are amazing!! This truly has helped me get organized and track my goals at a flick of the wrist!!!",5
1,"The sleep tracker, knowing how well I slept the night before gives motivation to continue good sleeping habits. I wish I could answer the phone with the watch.",5
1,I love it!!! My first one ever.,5
1,I received my Fitbit versa 2 Special edition strap. I love the app that syncs from my iPhone 8.,5

1,"I have no dislikes at this point, im glad i got this one. It holds a great charge, four to five days.",5
1,I upgraded to this model. I like it better than the other one i had. The battery seems to last longer.,5
0,"Bought this in October of 2019. Touch screen quit working... If I can get it to work and I reset, it works briefly but if the touch screen is not working it cannot be reset... I have researched this online and it appears to be a common problem.",2
1,"Great light wait and can find bands that fit me. Haven't figure out notifications yet, not sure if it's me or the app",5
0,"Worst smart watch I've ever owned! Numerous problem. Bought one for myself and one for my daughter, both have not worked right yet. Have tried everything, reset to factory settings, uninstall and reinstall app, nothing seems to work for more then a couple of days. I should have bought another Samsumg Galaxy. My old one is still working is just outdated. Will be throwing this in the trash and buy a new galaxy.",1
0,Didn't last even a year.,1
0,Gave this to my daughter for Christmas. Has now stopped working. Seems the last day to return was January 31st. Will need to see if there are other options since its not even 3 months old.,1
0,I gave to my wife for Christmas and the screen now is not responding and flashing after 1 month & less than 2 weeks of use. Of course the return deadline went by 5 days ago.,1

1,This was a birthday gift for my 11 year old grandson and he is loving it!!!,5
1,"Estoy muy arrepentida de haber comprado este reloj. Soy corredora y no me da la distancia ni el pace correctos, he tenido que descargar otras app para correr con Adidas Running y Nike para poder entrenar. El reloj es muy bonito pero sus funciones y su app no son precisas, vuelvo a Garmin asap!",3
0,"I already have the app, use to have a charge 3, bought this versa 2, went to add device, I select versa 2, then app flickers and goes back to the settings page where I started from without recognizing the device. I tried rebooting, tried turning bluetooth on/off to no avail. Bumer, it is unusable, have to return",1
0,"It has stopped working and just received for Christmas 2021. Says data not cleared and sync and try again. I have tried to reset from my phone, but no luck. I believe a new one needs to be sent to replace this one. Disappointed!!",2
1,"This is a great fitbit! Had some problems with receiving notifications after ios update, but that's been resolved. It's almost like having an Apple watch but at a much better price.",5

1,Who far this is doing exactly what it supposed to do Battery life is fantastic had Vera one thought that was good but I am getting five day or more per charge,5
0,"I've had this Versa less than 6 months and it no longer accurately tracks mileage on my runs, walks, bike rides, etc. It used to work correctly and I was required to update the device and it no longer works correctly. No help/assistance has been received from Fitbit.",2
1,I absolutely have enjoyed the switch over to Fitbit. It’s nice that it’s centers around physical activity and not 100 other things that I never even paid attention to. Shouldn’t have waited so long to switch over.,5
1,"Other than occasional instances of recording general inactivity - reading, watching TV, or general relaxing - as sleep, it does everything it's supposed to, and does it well.",5
0,I have to send it back to FitBit for a replacement. Tried to replace it through Amazon but they were out of stock and just wanted to refund my purchase. Not what I wanted since I got it on Prime Day :(,1

1,It takes FOREVER to set it up but i absolutely love it!!!! Ended up getting one for my husband as well.,5

1,I have had several fit bits and each on gets better with more options and better design. This looks nice and is very functional,5

0,"My family owns 3 Fitbit devices. This Versa was purchase 1 year, 4 months ago. It was great, until it just stopped working. Because it's just past the warranty period, customer service offered 25% discount towards the purchase of a replacement product. Why would I spend another $100-150 towards a product with a very short life cycle. Ridiculous!",1
1,Large panel allows me to see items easier. Many fine features. I am still trying to learn them all.,5
1,This is a great product but after 4 months not the Fitbit is not keeping a charge. I bought the protection and hope they can help,4

1,Nothing to dislike,5
1,"Was uncomfortable at first, but then, I don’t wear any watches or anything normally. Took a few days to get used to having something on my wrist.

It has also caused this rash on my arm. I ordered a new band because I am not sure if it is the band or the Fitbit. The Fitbit battery is supposed to last 6 days. Did I get a lemon????",1
0,"Don't waste your money for the heart rate monitor, it is less than 6 months old and as soon as I start sweating working out the heart rate monitoring just stops. I haven't even tested its ""water-proof"" Ness because of this. Besides this, the app is good.",1
1,"I love this to track my calories, walking, and receiving texts. Just wish I could respond back to the person from my watch. Maybe, I can but it came with minimal instructions so difficult to learn everything about it. Still learning. It’s very comfortable to wear, I forget that it’s on sometimes.",4

1,I am so excited about my new Fitbit! The battery life is awesome and it doesn't turn on in my sleep. Definitely worth the purchase!,5

1,"I bought this Fitbit Versa 2 in August 2020 and the other day the face popped off and won't snap back in. It's not even a year old and it malfunctioned. I loved this watch, wore it all the time, even to bed to track my sleep. That was a waste of money. Boohoo",3
1,"I love it all!! It keeps track of my heart rate, hourly steps, and has Alexa! Easy to use.",5
0,This fitbit was not accurate AT ALL! The step counter was way off. The sleep time was off. I would not recommend this to anyone!,1
1,Works well for steps! Wish it could tell when you do other Exercises I forget to turn on for weight training so it gives you no credit for it.,5

 Love my Fitbit!!! but not sure why this has happened, 2 times now. Please help as to how I get get a replacement.",2
1,Really enjoy the basics of this watch. Not very tech savvy and it works for me.,5
1,I bought three of these as Christmas presents. My boys LOVE them. My middle son loves to monitor his steps every day. My oldest is monitoring his sleep habits on it. I’ll be buying more for friends/family this year.,5
1,Loved it to track my swimming laps in pool.,5
0,If you want to get all the data you have to pay them money every month.,1
0,"This watch is defective. It does not stayed paired to my phone. I've had to unpaired and pair again 3 times, now it won't even pair, at all. It keeps searching for my phone, but can't find it. I'm sending this watch back.",1
1,I love mine! I always get compliments and people always think it's an apple watch. It's cute and works as expected. Definitely recommend and would purchase again.,5
1,"The screen is large enough to read all the functions and easy to use them. It also has Alexa. I am still learning how to use it, but am glad I upgraded from the inspire HR.",5
0,"They make it sound way better than webcast it is!! I can not connect the watch to my phone through bluetooth for I don't know what reason and I've had the watch on 20min. And says I already have 2,500 steps?? When all I walked was to the kitchen and back?",2
1,"Very happy with the product. Love the features and love the app. It keeps me motivated, tells me the weather, gives me reminders. I set set alarms, use it at the cash register. I am logging my food in the app and losing some weight as a result. Very easy to use.",5
1,This fit bit works well. The battery last fairly long if u dont use the apps all the time. Battery lasts about 3.5 4 days if apps are used often. The Alexa thing is kinda cool but also pretty pointless as it is limited to what it can do.,5
1,My dad loves this watch. It literally does everything and is easy to use once you get it set up.,5
1,"All of the info I was looking for - steps, sleep, heart rate - and it’s been working flawlessly since purchase 11/2019",5
0,I was not able to use this because the large wrist band does not fit the case. I'm giving it a rating of one star until I can get one that the large wrist band fits.,1
1,I love this thing!!! I used to have a my fitness pal app to track my calories but now it's all in my fitbit app. Charges very fast too. I never want to take it off!,5
0,"The company just keeps asking stupid questions Like, ""did I open the box"" how would I know it didn't work if I didn't open it.",1
0,"I bought this in October 2020 and it was fine for what I bought it for, but the button has stopped working, rendering it useless. In addition, the band is flimsy and breaks easily, this is right after it irritates your wrist. Won’t be purchasing another from this family of products.",1
0,it works,2
1,Great tracking watch. Does everything it's suppose to do. Charges great. Lasts about 3 to 4 days. Multiple face options. Worth the money.,5
1,"So far I have not found anything wrong with the watch other than the operator. In due time I am sure I will enjoy it. Even tho I have had the watch a couple of weeks, really need more time to evaluate. I will update review later.",5
0,I’ve been using this watch for 2 weeks and find that it’s completely inaccurate with steps and distance. The sleep function is worthless too. It either doesn’t track at all or just tracks you putting it on and off of sleep.,1
1,Got this for my dad and he loves it. Text is big so he can read it without glasses and he loves how easy it is to use. Highly recommend,5
1,"Long strap appears defective. I can remove and replace short strap over and over, but long strap will not seat into position.",3
0,Do NOT count on this as an extension of your phone. I get about 1/20 notifications pushed to this and the ones that come are days old. Spotify pairing is virtually worthless as I have to reset it every single time. Would return but I think I waited too long,2
1,"Very good HR traking in any activity. The AMOLED display is awsome, it has bright and vivid colors. The apps are also great. Its defenetly an excelent watch.",5
1,I like that the battery lasts. I like that it gives you a detailed description of your sleep. I j wish it tracked kick sets. But overall I am very happy with it.,4
0,Wore for one week. Didn't wear while doing dishes or showering. Wore it properly and ended up with burn marks on my skin that took weeks to go away. Small burn marks right where charging ports are on watch. I liked watch but had to return.,1
0,This is the second time that I have Foster Fitbit first step to one slipped right off my wrist which I lost shortly after purchasing and now the second one has stopped working all of a sudden and I cannot afford to keep buying these Fitbit watches I need some help,1
0,Its extremely hard to pair to use and get it synchronized. After 24 hours with the device...im extremely disappointed with it. If its not working within the next 48 hours i will be ought to return it,2
1,Expensive but exactly what my husband wanted,5
0,"Watch started losing tracking info from .25 to 1 full mile off during walking exercise.Now won’t even turn on and is stuck on 1 screen.Upon contacting FitBit, I was told only had a 90 day warranty. Upon looking up website, I find its 1 year. Would never buy another one.",1
1,Exactly what I needed!! Best motivation ever. Please with my purchase. Well worth the money.,5
1,This was actually a gift for my daughter and she has constantly told me how great it is and all it can do. It was the perfect gift,5
0,"Haden trouble calling up sleep patterns, and doesn't keep charge too long. I feel it still has bugs in it. I would get different Versa.",2
1,"What I like best about the Fitbit watch is the fact that I find myself encouraged to have daily walks, and I love the 2 minute relaxation exercise.",5
1,I'm using this watch for my tracking of my sleep and steps.,5
1,It's not even a year and my fitbit is not working!!!,3
1,"I bought this to replace a smaller fit bit. I like the larger display. While it said it was water proof, I had read a review that it wasn’t. About a week after getting it, I was diving into the water. Right before I went into the water I realized I had forgotten to take it off. I got out, took it off and dried it. I’m happy to say I have not had any problems with it.",5
1,"If you have anIPhone.Basically read mode only. you do not get all the functionality as with Android. No texting back through the watch, no sound etc",5
0,I have had this watch for 11 months no longer works.. looks like new... face does not light up can not access any apps no help from anyone would not suggest anyone purchase this from AMAZON,1
1,I’ve had a Fitbit for six years and this is my fifth model. I wish I’d switched earlier. I like the look and the software.,5
1,This only lasted a year ! The iconic lasted 2 no the fitbit family sucks! Now if it was cheaper then I wouldn't have complained but their too pricey n not worth it,5
0,"I have a galaxy s10 and I had constant syncing issues. I rarely received all my notifications. I reset the watch, did all the troubleshooting and even called fitbit for help. Nothing worked",2
1,I gave this to a family member. They are very happy with the performance. Sharp looking.,5
1,"I bought this about seven months ago. I was skeptical to buy electronics from amazon, but everything went smoothly! The Fitbit was in perfect condition when I received it, came with a charger, and all instructions. Would recommend!",5
1,Like that you can shower with it on.,5
0,"After 1 Yr. and 5 months, my Versa 2 quit working - will no longer swipe. I’m a gentle user. Fitbit won’t warranty this since it’s past 12 month period. Think it was water/perspiration. Never do I swim or shower/bath with it - Frankly I don’t trust their assertion that it’s water rated to 50 meters!?",2
1,Love it! Wearing mine 24/7 besides shower time and batter lasts and lasts. Sincs well with my iphone11 and Alexa is a great addition.,5
0,"Why woiuld I suggest to anyone to purchase a Versa 2! Less than 2 years old, with the battery charged to 100 % , the charge doesn't last 3 days. It was my understanding that a fully charged battery lasts 5 days.NEVER AGAIN!",1
1,Love the color,5
1,Love my versa 2! Easy to read without my glasses!,5
1,"There are hundreds of reviews of this product so I don't feel inclined to add much to the pile. It works well, looks nice and at $200 is a great buy. You need to spend a lot more to get a little bit more.",5
1,"Very easy fast set up, easy to use and understand. Quality item that motivates movement. Love this item.",5
1,I went from Apple Watch to the Versa as its has far superior battery life and has all the features that I need.,5
1,It just quit working,5
1,"The battery holds for several days. Charges fast! She loves the way it keeps her statistics as she is a walker. Very well made, a quality item.",5
1,I upgraded from the Charge3 to Versa2 and I don't regret it at all. Slick stylish tracker/watch all in one with a 5 to 7 days battery life.,5
1,Great watch and fitness tracker altho a bit quirky to program. I have been unable to program for 24 hour clockwhich I use everywhere else.,4
0,Shorts out when your wearing and sweating the least bit of sweat it stops working,1
1,I bought it and is helping me a lot. Works as a charm. The battery charge very fast. And also is in sync with my health provider.,5
1,Love it. I wanted to upgrade my tracker so I purchased this one. It’s really nice. It arrived as expected.,5
1,This thing does everything but sing and dance. The battery doesn’t last long but that I’d to be expected with all that it is doing throughout the day.,4
0,Doesn’t do iPhone text messages. Tried all the fixes. I guess apple isn’t playing nice with other smart watches anymore,2
1,"Bought for my mother in law. She loves it, matched with her Apple phone, rose gold was a nice color and easy set up for the hubby.",4
1,"Great item , highly recommended. Fast delivery and product.",5
1,Just the tracking I was looking for. Comfortable to wear nice size makes it easy to see.,5
1,My daughter likes the text feature. Little confusing connecting Bluetooth feature on phone. You actually have to go through Fitbit app to link to cell. Followed online instructions,5
0,Worked for a few months...,2
1,It's great! Seeing immediatel results really helps keep me motivated. So much better than the old way. Absolutely love!,5
0,Won't hold a charge. Resets every time it's turned on. Does not store my data. Manufacture customer service refuses to help even though I purchased less 4 months ago. Not a good buy,1
1,"Feels very comfortable on the wrist, responsive and relatively accurate though heart rate may be off at time but generally fine. Yet to try the accuracy of distance tracking via gps. Battery life about 4 days without always on but then it's a brand new watch so gotta see in a year's time if still can retain battery life.",5
1,Apparently I'm allergic to the strap on this watch. After wearing three days my wrist gets red and itchy. So I had to quit wearing it. So Sad.,4
1,Overall I like this smart watch. I do get inconsistent heart rate numbers during exercise and inconsistent step counts with the elliptical. It is easy to read and easy to setup.,4
1,Used primarily as a watch but to also keep track of my BPM while walking for maximum weight loss.,5
1,Does a great job at a reasonable price.,5
1,I have had my watch for about a year and the battery requires recharging almost weekly. On more than one occasion it has died the same day after showing a full charge. It is starting to no be very reliable.,3
0,"I bought this in October of 2019 and it has stopped working. It was working fine yesterday, but just suddenly stopped. This was supposed to be a limited edition and the return time has expired. This is my third Fitbit and I think it will be my last. I am tired of them just quitting suddenly.",1
1,The best decision ever!!!!!,5
1,Not what I expected. No speaker. No ability to add/change viewable items on clock face. Much prefer Android Wear!,3
1,"Having problems with keeping it paired to my phone. When it works and stays paired it is an excellent product, but it loses connectivity at least every other week. Took 2 days and multiple attempts just this week to get it repaired.",3
1,"The sleep and steps functions are the most important to me. I was really excited when I found out that I could also go on Fitbit on my computer, go to the dashboard and get even more information than I was getting on my phone. I love the purple color as well.",5
1,I love my Fitbit. The app is awesome and I love the barcode scanner that looks up nutrition facts. The battery on my watch lasts me about 4 days,5
1,It's a very nice looking watch with a lot of different options and very easy too use.I’m very happy with it!,4
1,I like the watch. I wish that there were more apps for it. Also would come with one screen protector to put on the screen. It scratches easily.,5
1,I most appreciate the waterproof feature. And it seems to be tougher and there are less moving parts to break I love it.,5
1,Only problem I have is that I am unable to receive my text messages on my Fitbit. I have followed all the instructions and it still won’t work. Other than that it’s great,4
1,"Just ok, time keeps changing to wrong time",3
0,"Sent pictures to Fitbit to replace as they had instructed and they refuse to believe that it is a crack. They said it is a scratch, but scratches do not travel, nor does condensation so up on inside of face when wet.Love my Fitbit, but their Customer Service is awful, going to get a Garmin or an Apple watch instead.",1
1,"Absolutely love this version of FitBit. It is a wonderful tool for fitness and so many other smartwatch expectations.Setup is a breeze, battery life is awesome, and links to so many things is seamless",5
1,Great looking and keeps me moving. Great for an alarm. Includes Alexa.,5
1,"I really like the Fitbit Versa 2, however I did not realize that all the functions are not compatible with my iPhone.The features that are compatible work great!",4
1,"I don't really like smartwatches, however, this smart watch is very nice and high tech.",4
1,arrived the day after it told me it was dropped off at my house. Great watch. Only complaint so far is that you can’t enter your water consumption on the watch itself. If you put in let’s say 16 oz it will log it as .3 oz. I just enter it into app itself. not sure what’s going on there but other than that I’m happy.,3
1,"This device is fantastic! Easy to use, soft and very comfortable to wear! It tracks everything I need...and then some!",5
0,Stopped working after 6 months. Constantly sending annoying notifications. Get a different brand,1
1,Do not buy if you have tattoos on wrist or arms. I did that mistake and it doesnt track anything,3
1,I've been using my Fitbit Versa 2 for over a week now and I absolutely love it! It pushes me to work hard with staying true to my fitness goals as well as really helped me get into healthy daily habits. The bedtime reminder is my favorite! I would absolutely recommend this to anyone looking for fitness watches.,5
1,"Update again: Fitbit sends the replacement after a short email conversation. Good communication and fast response.Update: The touch screen is not working anymore after less than 3 months. I tried to restart the watch but still no response. What a shame!The battery is awesome, you can charge it once a week. And it is easy to connect to both Android and IOS devices.",5
0,"I do not feel comfortable with this device, its configuration took almost 3 hours to update. Then, when I connected it with my cell phone, I could see that it already had a history of activities as if it were not new and I noticed that it is not synchronized continuously, so I must synchronize it manually. I also receive messages on my cell phone and they only notify me of some. and today I couldn't even synchronize manually",1
1,I love that you can get different bands for it. I also love that I can track my sleep and heart rate.,5
1,Great battery life. A little big. But I love it.,5
1,I had a Fitbit blaze before this one. I really liked it just wanted to move up to the next one. So far very happy with this product.,5
1,Bought this for my daughter for Xmas... I have an older basic Fitbit... but this one is super cute and love the tech!! Buying my own!!,5
1,Product does not connect to texts unless you buy an Alexa subscription!!!!!,3
1,I like the sleep tracking.,5
1,Performed As expected,5
1,I' m very dissappointed that my soundpeat earbuds wiil not connect to the versa. I have tried every suggestion I have found. I have tried numerous times to pair them and never get past versa saying it is pairing. BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!,3
1,Very nice looking comfortable. But what I doesn't is that Everytime I move my arms it counts as steps! So is not acured. Maybe is it because do not have a GPS built-in like the Ionic! I really don't know.I will say more after I use it for a week.,4
1,Great option for a fitness tracker with up to date tech and fearures. I have small wrists and it wasn't to bulky. Highly reccomend,5
1,easy to use,5
1,I love this fitbit. the battery last about a week. which I fine amazing. the face is large and its easy to read. the setting on it are great. all in all a great watch/Activity tracker,5
1,Happy with product. Except the other plastic band that was sent did not fit. It was too big to clip onto the watch.,4
1,More features then I could have asked for. Love the sleep tracking app.,5
1,Great item,4
1,I love the features it offers to help keep me motivated.,5
1,This is exactly what I was needing. It keeps pretty accurate track of heartrate and sleep. You can edit the way it looks through the app which is nice.,5
1,I love my Fitbit Versa 2. I really like the sleep tracking. It is much more detailed than my previous watch.,5
1,Keeps great time and data.,4
0,Worked fine for tracking but could never get it to sync with phine for text notification and had to manually sync for other items,2
1,Purchased this watch when it was on Father's day sale so saved $50 on it. I can easily say that it is the best fitness tracker and smartwatch in this budget. I was using Fitbit HR before and switched from that tracker as I misplaced it somewhere so you can say that I am an old Fitbit fan.,5
1,"I love how it looks, how it feels around my wrist and how convenient it is for me to not have to check my phone. However, I'm not to sure the steps tracker is accurate which kind of sucks cause thats the MAIN reason I purchased it but still I do like it.",4
1,"Does not speak to text for Apple, but that’s apples fault.I returned it and bought a Fitbit Charge 3.",3
1,Battery life averages around 96 hrs before I need to charge it. Tracking accuracy for different exercise modes is pretty good. I have had to resync a couple of times when the date or time is wrong but is resets without a problem.,5
1,Upgraded from older surge and am very pleased. A built in GPS would be nice but not a necessity.,5
1,"The added exercise options, and the improved sleep analysis are what I wanted",5
1,Bought as a gift for my friend and he is very happy with it,5
0,Not happy at all! I keep a screen protector on my watch all the time. And this still happens.,2
1,Love my fitbit super convenient. Help me feel not so lazy lol. I love it,5
1,Nice and easy to use,5
1,Notifications don’t always come thru and wish the battery life was loLnger. But overall I really like it and recommend it.,5
1,Overall I like it with only one issue which is actually taking sometime to sync with my iphone.,4
1,I am a Fitbit person and this one is great. I hope I don't break this one. They last about a year for me.,5
1,Good quality for the price and a great fit . Give it a try,4
1,A warranty is an absolute necessity with this watch. I bought mine in 6/2020 and by 10/2021 some of the touchscreen stopped working and it's been a common nuisance with these fitbits!,3
1,"Love all that it can do but it seems like the battery life of this tracker is short. Only last 3, 4 days tops before I have to put on to charge.",3
1,"Like my other Fitbit but on steroids.Lots a cool features. More than my wife will ever use, but she loves it and that is all that matters.A little jealous of her actually....",5
1,"Wife LOVES it!! Something a little bigger for her, and the various tools she is able to utilize really excite her. (Like the Alexa feature!!) But she loves the bigger face to be able to read more clearly. Everything is likeable about this Versa - I have one as well!! :-)",5
1,"I bought this watch for my son, his has a black band. I loved his so much that I bought one for myself, pink band",5
1,I am really enjoying my Fitbit..also bought multiple bands and face covers to get a multitude of different looks and styles. Love it!,5
1,"Great battery life, simply and very functional. I use it for step tracking and running Couch to 5k",5
0,"After 3 months of using, never for swimming or water activities the screen went blank and no mater how many times I’ve reset it, let the battery die and then charge it, can’t get it functional again. Very disappointed. Save your $200 and buy a different fitness tracker.",1
1,"I started my health journey and wanted a watch to so I could track my workouts, steps, and sleep. This does all of that and sometimes I even forget I’m wearing it because of how comfortable it is. The only problem that I’ve had with it is that sometimes it stop tracking my heartbeat and it’s frustrating, especially in the middle of a workout. Other than that I had been perfect so far.",5
0,What a scam. I paid for a versa 2 and only received a versa. Paid an extra $40. I will be sending back.,1
1,It didn't monitor my heart rate consistently.,3
1,Sleep tracking is good just doesn't give me a rating every day. Love the watch and accuracy is great. Text along with caller id is awesome.,5
0,"Product was supposed to be new but it came used with fingerprints, scratched and stains. The usb is from a non Fitbit item.",2
0,"I had to get my Fitbit versa replaced same day I received it because it wouldn't charge, it wouldn't sync and the data had not been cleared from it. When I received my replacement and proceeded to charge it, I checked it 2 hours later and IT WOULDNT CHARGE TO A FULL BATTERY EITHER!🤨 my guess is in order for it to fully charge, the clamps have to remain open I'm not sure but unsatisfied and returning both.",1
1,This is the absolute BEST activity tracker I have ever had. It is extremely accurate and gives me a ton of useful information.,5
1,I really like this fit bit versa 2 because I can easily read the time.I find it easier to manually set a timer or reminder and don’t use the Alexa function very often.,5
0,The battery life sucks. Fitbit doesn't seem to care.,2
1,My wife owns this watch and she loves It.,5
0,"This watch was working fine, we’ve had several Fitbit watches. Last week this watch just stopped working and unable to charge. After Trouble shooting with Amazon we are now jumping through hoops to receive a replacement!!!",1
1,Great to have battery last one week before needing charge.,5
1,"Bought as a birthday gift, it arrived early! The person who it was for said she loved it and would rate it 5 stars.",5
1,Nice!,5
0,Doesn't track sleep correctly and has left some pretty bad marks on my wrist.,2
0,Back button no longer works. Started acting up 6 months ago. Did all the steps that were told to do. Stopped working completely in Nov 2020,2
1,"So far so good. I love the color, style and fit. It's perfect for tracking my steps and exercise. I'm skeptical about going in the pool with it after my original one died after swimming but other than that love it.",5
1,Works well.,5
0,I say this as a former product manager who dealt with serious product hardware and software issues: The Versa 2 software is not ready for prime time. If I were the product manager and executive management I would be embarrassed by the poor reliability of this product. Testing was clearly very inadequate. I hope Google can bring some stability to this product. I am VERY disappointed with my purchase.,1
1,My boyfriend loves it. I wish it had a better pairing with iPhone but overall Great gift.,5
1,I Bought this product January 20 21 and this is the second time that it has failed on me for no reason and it will not come back on. Tried same troubleshooting as the first time. how can I get one replaced under warranty?,3
1,I love the smart features on my Fitbit,5
1,Love it. I love the face that shows my blood sugar from my dexcom.,5
1,I love using this for fitness. It’s great because not only does it track your steps and what not but it also keeps track through the app the food you eat and water you drink.,5
1,Don't waste your time with a cheap watch. Fitbit is the only way to go!,5
1,So just got this but so far loving it. Takes some getting use to for got to get my screen protector waiting on it. Love my versa 2.,5
1,"I love the functionality of it. Pretty accurate readings on calorie burn, heart rate and location. I like that it pauses and resumes automatically during my runs if I'm stopped at a stop light. I don't like to wear it when I sleep because it's uncomfortable for me. I've worn it a few times and it tracked my sleep fairly well.",5
1,"Hi,I've been cycling so much and wanted to see distance in mileage but it never worked? It would only track the total time of exercise. I think the design and layout are beautiful though! It just may not be best for what I specifically need- cycling and swimming!",3
0,Cannot get it to sync to my I phone,1
1,Great health tracker and smart watch,5
1,Good product!,4
0,"Many times, Fitbit Versa will not sink. It is hard to set from wrist. Sometimes it will not give sleep data. As of today, it has not synced the steps and sleep data since Sunday. It starts to sync but does not finish. It is Thursday, have reset app, phone, etc. but is still not working; starting to hate this thing.",2
0,"I am very disappointed this is the second Versa 2 I have owned I purchased this Fitbit from Amazon in December of 2020 and it has already quit working. The time was not accurate the last week and now it will not do anything. I have never written a review before, but this is just poor quality. Don’t Buy",1
0,See image says it all. Ordered NEW.,1
0,"I like my old surge better than versa - it was easier to operate. With that said, my versa was delivered to the wrong house. Amazon delivery need to get their acts together. This is the second time that items were deliver to the wrong house. Don't you read the address number right on the side of the house. The house numbers are so big and blatant that you can't miss it but the delivery guy does not bother to look at it.",2
1,Love my Fitbit!!!Great for tracking my daily activity and sleep.,5
0,"I dislike that I have to charge it every fourth day. That is too much. Also, I find it to be a bit big & bulky. Just my opinion.",2
0,Stay away from this watch. it will burn your skin,1
1,I love my new watch so far. I've had it for a couple weeks and like the sleep tracking. I also like the step tracker and heart rate feature.,5
1,"I love the larger face, it’s easy to read. I also like that it keeps track of my heart rate while I sleep. I have sleep apnea and I can show the results to my PCP and cardiologist. Wonderful devise for tracking calories, heart rate and hours sleeping.",5
1,My wife loves it. It has all the bells and whistles of a smart watch.,5
1,I've had a Fitbit for 4 years and it keeps getting better! It's the first thing I check every morning and last thing I check at night! Love it!,5
1,"Love the color, been looking to get a new fitbit. Has all kinds of features that I'm still learning. Having some problems with the music applications",5
1,"Easy set up. Good quality/doesn’t feel cheap. Works as expected. Would rather have Apple Watch, but for the price it’s a decent alternative.",5
1,"I had a Fitbit Alta and it was okay; but the battery life was lacking. My Versa lasts a week, works well, and is easy to use!",5
1,The first fit bit it purchased was easy to use and understand. The newer one is not as user friendly.,4
1,Love the fact that the Versa 2 is waterproof and the watch stays always on. There's lots of functions that come standard. Compatibility with Spotify and Alexa is a plus,5
0,"FitBit Versa 2 died within four months of purchased. It can't be reset nor can it be factory reset. The device stays frozen on the screen in the photo. I feel like a fool because this is the 2nd FitBit product that has died on me (I had a FitBit Charge 2 which died after about a year of use). Needless to say, I'm not purchasing another FitBit product again.",1
1,Excellent product Performance is amazing. Encourages me to move. Came from the manufacturer . just as it appears and is described. Recommend Versa 2 fitbit.,5
1,Seems to track sleep when I’m in bed or reclining position. I nap a lot in recliner. Misses those sleep times.,5
1,"Love everything about it, including the price. Keeping track of my steps and activity is really helping me with my diet and fitness.",5
1,I love 💕 my Versa 2 watch ! Perfect for my workouts & half the price of the Apple 🍎 Watch! I compared both watches & so happy 😁 I purchased the Versa 2!!!,5
1,"Wife seems to like it. She is not tech savvy though. Seems to work as intended. Battery holds charge for several days, for now....",4
1,I love the watch it tracks everything I want it to and has useful apps. The only complaint I have is that the pack in band is just terrible. I was using it for two weeks and it rubbed the skin off of my wrist. I bought a new band and all of that went away.,4
1,"Works well. Sleep tracking is not very accurate but other than that, the other features work well.",4
0,My watch was good first 3 months but it's stopped working all of a sudden. It never fell down or damaged. I don't know what to do.,1
1,I prefer the old watch this is a little to complicated for me,5
1,"Bought this to replace my ionic that quit after a year. Love it, love that i can put music on it and battery lasts 7 days",5
1,"Sleep tracker isn’t always functioning, but that might be that it was switched off somehow (?) I had to buy a new band because I was getting a dry spot underneath the factory one. Overall, I like it.",5
0,I have had this watch for less than 6 months and it quit working out of no where. The watch has not been damaged in any way.,1
1,"I love this watch! It is my second one, but an upgrade from the first one! I love the Alexa feature!",5
1,"Love all the apps, notifications sleep tracker heart rate everything about it!",4
1,Fitness helper for every level.,5
0,I am very disappointed with this. It hasn't worked right since 3 weeks after buying. The button on the side doesn't work to make the screen active and moat the time shaking my wrist doesn't work either. It randomly shows up whenever it feels like it.,1
1,Love it,5
0,Does not stay connected to phone. Have to reconnect all the time. Spotify app barely works and I have a premium account. Sleep tracking is not accurate. Look for another watch. This one is too much work. Back it goes.,2
0,Think watch should last more than 18 months. Screen shorted out today.,2
1,"It works great for tracking steps and heart rate, however when mountain biking the total milage is 25% to 50% less than Strava users who are tracking the same ride. All fitbit and fitbit forum solutions have not worked.",4
1,"I like wearing watches, but this is not just a watch. I feel like a spy. And I can pay for Starbucks with my bling.",5
1,It was shipped to me quickly which was no surprise. It works great. It came with extra bands in small and large size. There are several clock faces to chose from. It tracks more activities than my previous Fitbit.,5
0,Microphone stopped working about a month after I bought it. Now I cant send or recieve texts while at work which is the only reason I bought it,1
1,I gave this as a gift and while the Versa itself is fine the larger sized black band which is provided as an alternate to the smaller one that comes attached broke on day 3.,3
0,AFTER WORKING ON SETING IT UP UP FOR 2 DAYS I AM RETURNING IT. NO SUPPORT AVAILABLE!,1
0,My one year warranty ran out on August 14th. The glass cover popped off for no apparent reason. It appears this has happened to many owners of the Versa 2. This is a known quality issue… very disappointing.,1
1,"I didn’t think I needed the extra features of the FB2 but I’m super happy that I went with this model. I’m prone to migraines so it’s interesting to see my sleep modes and how they correlate to my migraines. I really like the tracking of my steps, distance and heart rate. I really like the little kudos it gives me too! 😉😁",5
0,Junk,1
1,"Love this Fitbit, my favorite of the three I've had. Easy to setup, seems fairly accurate. Love that I can change up the bands.",5
1,"Waterproof ability is very convenient, do not need to take it off in the shower, give the kids a bath or worry when washing your hands. I have been wearing it while on shift at the station and it’s been through a lot without breaking. Battery charges quickly and lasts a long time.",4
0,The smartwatch was not compatible with my phone. i was told thst i would receive a full refund of $138.40 and only received &112.42. i am very unhappy and would like a full refund as i was promised by your representative,1

1,I initially was excited and loved the look of my new Fitbit Versa 2 until I started experiencing episodes of irritation rashes from the silicone band. I now see reviews where the same has happened to others. I think I'll return it and shop other options.,4
1,So far so good,5
1,Love my fit bit!!! I like how I can see my text messages and know when my phone is ringing. I am very pleased with all the features of this product.😊,5
1,"Love this device and all of it's features, ESPECIALLY the Bitmoji clock face! I find myself looking at it constantly to see what ""I"" am doing! It was a bit disappointing to see that Pandora only works with a subscription on the device when it is free on my phone. But overall, I am in love with my Versa2!",5
1,The watch does what it’s supposed to do and it helps me achieve my fitness goals by keeping me engagedThe only drawback is the bezel is quite big,4
1,This was a gift to my daughter who has a daughter with Type 1 Diabetes. She loves the watch as it offers her some peace of mind following my granddaughters diabetic sensor readings,5
1,I am so glad that I made this purchase. I had been dying from a good pair of ear bugs. The sounds quality is great.,5
1,Didn't pair with my note 9,3
0,"I contacted fitbit support and received a second Versa 2, that after two weeks does not work either. If you buy this product, I guarantee, you will be sorry. My sister in law had the exact same issues, but luckily did not go through tech support and just got her money back. Since 2013, I have been a faithful fitbit user, but that ended 2020 with the horrible technology of the Versa 2.Lori E.",1
1,"The fitbit has made my life so much easier! It tracks my steps, my fitness, my sleep, ect. I have been wearing it daily for several weeks now and have zero complaints.",5

1,Both given as gifts so unable to evaluate but feedback has been positive,5

1,Got this for my mom as a gift and she absolutely loves it. Easy for her to set up as well.,5
1,"My favorite activity and sleep tracking watch so far. Love the fact that you have Alexa on the watch. It takes a few seconds to respond and doesn't talk to you, just writes the reply on screen, but still makes you feel like you have some futuristic tech on you, which I personally love.",5
1,Love the size and people think it's an apple watch. Still need to get it hooked up to my phone so I can use all its options.,4
1,So far I am adding mor apps every day and I love it !! It even syncs up with WW so it’s great assistance for me in many ways,5
1,The watch fits fine and looks good but it has trouble syncing often and I have to reset it with the side button.,4
1,Bought two. Both friends love them.,5
1,Love it so wasy to use,5
0,I purchased the watch 10 months ago. Last week the face of the watch come off. For no reason I don't understand. It didn't last a year. My wife only walks with the watch and she's a nurse so I don't understand why the face come off and its not under pressure.. Would like some understanding please??,1
0,"The touch screen stopped working in less than one month. Other than that it was nice, I ended up switching to Withings. I've had other fitbits in the past and they lasted forever.",1
1,My wife loves the Versa 2. She's able to get her text messages to her watch. And able to send text out through Alexa's voice command.,5
1,Love my Versa 2 overall. This Fitbit has a nice screen and very simple interface.The only drawback is the band. I’ve had two of them break within six months. Ended up buying a mesh steel band from amazon. With the aftermarket band the Versa 2 earns an easy five stars.,4
1,"My wife had a Samsung watch and hated it, she had a Fitbit before and went back to it and is very happy with this watch.",5
1,I love the accountability of activity and tracking my sleep. Very useful and helpful to improving my health.,5

1,Easy to set up,5
1,"Absolutely love the look of this fitbit! Had the charge 2 previously and this is a nice upgrade. No issues so far. Still figuring out all it can do. Seems pretty acurate on the # of steps, heart rate, stairs, tracking runs & workouts. That's about all I've tried so far. Looking forward to trying everything else.",5
1,Daughter loves it so far,5
1,"I’ve had many fitness trackers and this one is by far one of the best ! It’s great alternative to the Apple Watch which is ultra expensive and it performs just as well. The only negative I have is the battery life doesn’t last as long as stated it’s closer to 4 days and when I charge it it never gets to 100%, it stalls at 99%.",5
1,"The sleep tracking feature is great, it will let you know how long you slept and in what stage of sleep you were in and for how long. The feature does require at least 3 hours of sleep to provide you sleep insight.",5
1,exactly what i wanted,5
1,my only issue is the app keeps unsyncing the fitbit from my phone and then i have to turn it on and off a few times then itll work,5
1,"The sleep monitoring and heart rate seems to be fairly accurate. The step counter, however, is not. It tracks your arm motion more than steps.",4
1,The strap irritates my skin and sometimes is difficult to put on! I take it off to shower for various reasons,4
1,Exc,5
1,I’ve had a Fitbit since the the company started. Versa is a great fit bit.,5
0,Good for sleep tracking and steps except the fact if won't stop Turing on and off! Plus is won't stay connected to my phone via Bluetooth so I don't always receive messages which was the whole point of purchasing.,2
0,Do NOT buy anything from Fitbit!!! It is not compatible with the iOS systems of most iPhones. I’ve had my Versa 2 for less than a week and I’ve had sooooo many issues. I never received notifications on it and now the Versa 2 has stopped working. And the Fitbit live chat support agents were *so* helpful. I’m returning this hunk of junk and getting an Apple Watch.,1
1,"Second Fitbit. The watch strap that came with it rubbed my wrist. Replaced and now is great! I like the Alexa App, it works well.",5
0,It is the worst watch I ever had. Very bad experience with the Fitbit APP. The Bluetooth always not working well and my phone couldn't find the device at all. I wouldn't recommend this garbage to my friends.,1
1,"I am very satified with this purchase several months later. It meets all of my fitness tracking needs and easily intergrates with other apps (my peloton bike specifically), and all at an affordable price point.",5
1,"It was a gift for my son-in-law for his birthday and he loves it! Uses it to keep up with his steps, length of sitting time, sleep and more.",5
1,I really like this watch. It does what it says it does! The only thing I would change is the screen. Wish it was a little bit smaller.,4
1,"I love everything about this ne Versa, I specially like the Alexa function, it's awesome!!",5
1,The Vera 2 is nice but not great it usually starts tracking my sleep an hour after I get in bed and the pulse rate monitor works about 75% of the time,5
0,Battery lasts 3 days and is dead. Brand new. Not happy.,2

1,It great for keeping up with your sleep hours and steps. Love it.,5

1,I absolutely LOVE this fitbit! It has all the features I was looking for and it's easy to use. This was the best purchase on Prime Day!!,5
1,This is a great smartwatch. I love the different modes for tracking workouts and the different watch face options.,5
1,The only thing that would make my Fitbit better is if I could make phone calls and send texts with it with my phone,5
1,I love my Fitbit!!! My husband bought me a Fitbit for Christmas and wear it everyday to achieve my 10000 step goal.,5
0,Does not register heart rate or track sleep.I bought it for specifically the heart and sleep monitor but neither work. Very inconsistent. Not sure if it's the watch itself or due to the seller selling bad merchandise.,1
1,Good battery life,5
1,Like the watch. It’s easy to use.,5
1,Like this Fitbit. Excellent battery life. Added features like weather. Let’s me know when someone is calling Can see my steps easily,5
0,Stopped working after 7 months.,1
1,Just over 2 years and it doesn’t work will not keep time. Nor does it keep steps correctly. Worked fine and then all the sudden it quit. Feeling like it should last more the 2 years . Will go with something else .,3
1,Each time I charge my Fitbit Versa 2 it loses connection to the main face page. Sometimes I can get it to connect now it’s becoming more difficult.,3
0,I hate to be charging so often,1
1,Love it. I replaced my Ionic with this and it’s much better than the Ionic. The only bad thing is the strap is very difficult to put on/change,5
1,Bought for husband as gift. He loves it. Has become obsessive about his exercise regimen since getting it which is great.,5
0,Had it one year and doesn't work,1
1,"My fiancée was super excited , had a little struggle getting everything but she did get it working.She loved it",4
1,"It was a gift, she loves every thing about it! Lots more features than her old one had.",5
1,Nice watch but too big for my small wrist. I wore it for a few hours and thought the calorie burn count was too high. I sent it back due to the large size,4
1,Love my watch. Wish it had a blood pressure measure included.,4
1,"My wife loves this,, awesome fitness tracker. Upgraded her from the original fitbit,, Happy wife is a happy life ,,))",5
1,Track my physical activity,5
1,"I use my fitbit for everything. I love that it tracks my sleep, it helps me to determine where I need to make some changes. I am pretty active and now use the fitbit coach every morning to do exercises right in my living room. Anytime, anywhere, I can take my workouts with me. I travel alot and it helps me track everything even when traveling. It's the best thing I've ever bought for myself.",5
1,Nice product with great battery life. The app is ok. Text messages and other alerts sometimes do not work with iPhone.,5
0,Received beginning of October it died beginning of March this is the second watch I've had thats done this then fitbit wants me to wait 2-3 weeks for a replacement? I won't be buying another.,1
1,I get many compliments on this watch. The battery life is very impressive. No complaints. Only but this on amazon others dont include alexa which I thought I wouldn't use but use.,5
0,You have to join and pay monthly service,2
1,"I've been a FitBit fan and user for years. Ive purchased almost every device they've offered throughout the years. This is by far the best one yet. Its slim, contemporary design is so fashionable and the Alexa feature is so convenient. I can set reminders, alarms and start my workout sessions verbally on the go without hassling with my smart phone to access the app. Fantastic!!!",5
1,Went from a iWatch to the fit bit. There are some features I really like on the iWatch that are not on for but like text response. I am sure it will eventually come about.,4
1,If you use it for what is intended to is a grate device but if you make the same mistake as me and expect it to be an smart watch you are wrong.,5
0,Heart rate monitor is wildly inaccurate. The cheaper watches are much better.,2
1,This does exactly what I need it to do. Step tracking and basic biometrics. I'm very happy with this purchase.,5
1,"Great watch for exercise, sleep, and heart rate stats. I have been using Fitbit watches since 2015 and the versa 2 is outstanding. I would definitely recommend to anyone.",5
1,Loooveee this watch! For the price I caught it on sale and am very happy! Had no issue with burning on my wrist as many reviews noted! If you’re on the fence buy it! Great for fitness and sleep tracking! And stylish and way cheaper then an Apple Watch if you don’t want all the bells and whistles!!,5
1,"So far I'm very pleased with it. I've never owned a Fitbit, bit I'm glad I do now. I find myself pushing myself to beat yesterday's results. I can't compare it to any other type of watch like this since it's my first. But I'd highly recommend it and glad I took my sister's advice and bought this.",5
0,Bought this 3 months ago and all the sudden it stopped syncing to my phone and now the watch won't even turn or charge. Looked up time line to return item and the deadline was 2 weeks ago now I'm stuck with a watch I can't even charge.,1
1,Love that it tracks my steps and excersise. I was unhappy that I would have to pay for the other apps. EX music.,3
1,Alexa doesn't work all the time. Have to go to app on phone to make it connect. Doesn't let me know about phone calls or messages. Battery life is good.,4
1,After 2 weeks it won't charge. Very disappointing but they replaced it and it has been fine,4
1,I have lost 4 pounds since I've set up my account. I plan on losing more as I learn more about my Fitbit,5
1,"Is it or isn't it water resistant? Good fit, no issues. Use the app and watch everyday. Sleep tracking is suspect.",4
1,"the sleep teaching is so so it doesn't recognize sleep well. the app is also ok. it tracks steps well and it attaches to the phone nicely, Android.",4
0,"If you are planning to buy this smartwatch, be aware that sooner or later ( 1 year with my first versa and now 4 months this versa 2) it will stop working ( either it will get into a boot loop and then die or will simply die - a blank screen, from one day to the other).I'm done with Fitbit. I'll try another brand.",1

1,It was a gift for my mom and she loves it!!!,5
0,"The reviews never stated that the app needed to run in the background for Alexa to work. I bought this because I enjoy Alexa, but it is useless. The app runs the battery down on the phone even when not logged on. I bought this to keep track of exercise, but it is not accurate unless your arms move. I would never buy again and feel that I have wasted my money.",2
1,Monitors heart! Cardiologist encouraged us to get one. Best surprise ever is that NOW my husband wants to exercise!,5
1,My wife absolutely loves her Versa2...tells me everything it does,5
0,"I've had this product for 1 week. Yesterday I had to hard reset as I was unable to sync to my phone. Today, the strap broke and stopped synching to the app again even after a software update. Not wasting my time with this and returning for a different model.",1
1,"I’ve lost lots of weight using various Fitbit products. This Versa 2, however, is the best ever. It lets me track exercise simply, has Alexa, Pandora and so much more. In addition, It has nearly a week’s battery life, lets me read my texts, alerts me of phone calls, provides timers and alarms and so much more.",5

0,"I bought it on May 2nd, 2020 and by January 15, 2021 was worthless. It started by losing connection and syncing with the app. I deleted and downloaded again and it never connected again. I kept using it independently and month later the screen went down and only showed half the fitbit logo (the dots).Total Crap!",1

0,Received it and it charged briefly then completely shutdown when attempting to pair and will not turn on.,1
1,The Versa 2 is a fine product. If I had one complaint... it would be that the device allowed the user to increase the font size of text messages and the like. Pretty unusable by eyes over 40.,4

1,Best on price and easy to use.,5
0,I love my Fitbit. I bought it November 2019 and paid almost $200. I wear it everyday as it’s designed for. I am careful to not shower or swim with it on. In less than a year it has completely fallen apart. The face separated from the bezel (see the picture). I’m very disappointed that it didn’t last even 1 year. I expected more from Fitbit.,1
0,WHAT THE HELL?????????????? Died after four months.,1
1,had an iwatch & returned it within a week. it didn’t have anything that the versa 2 has & battery only lasted a day at max. the versa 2 is a better deal & battery lasts almost 5 days this is an upgrade from the charge 2.,5

1,Good watch. Amazon Alexa feature is very useful. Battery life is pretty good. Sleep tracking is pretty accurate. I don’t like that sometimes it has trouble syncing to app. Also needs a feature that will find your lost phone like other smart watch. WiFi will disconnect and won’t auto connect.,4
1,Bought as a birthday present for my wife. She really loves it!,5
1,Love this for tracking. The app also let's you track food and water intake. As long as you don't have the always on display turned on the charge will last for several days !,5

0,I really do like the versa but I have continuously had issues with it freezing . I can’t restart it because I can not even get the settings to do so. Pretty much the only thing I can use is the main screen and press the button for Alexa.,2
0,"This watch is really beautiful, but when you have to do a simple task, like get a wifi connection, it's horrible! Have to restart everything, and unistall, and so and so... Really, the worst app ever!",1
1,Great product!!,5
1,Gifted it to a friend for their bday and they love it! Item is brand new in the box. Very sleek. Only downside is that it doesn’t come with a wall piece to plug charger into outlets.,5
1,This is my 2nd fit bit. I like it.,4
0,I got the Fitbit Versa 2 because I had the blaze and the blaze worked great but this Fitbit Versa 2 is not worth the money you cannot hook up to your Bluetooth easily it doesn't stay synced to my phone you can't find a screensaver that'll fit it and stay on it can't get text messages over it because it won't stay synced to the phone you pay this kind of money for a watch you expected to perform,2
0,I bought this fitbit for my wife for her birthday last year in June. It has already stopped working. We are very disappointed with this produce and there doesn't seem to be a way to contact the company to report the issues. Would not recommend!,1
1,Received as a birthday / mothers day gift. I wear it ALL THE TIME. Love the color. No issues with it. Would highly recommend.,5
0,Apparently these have a known issue with the screens going black and not being recoverable. This is so disappointing to spend this kind of money and within 5 months I have to go through an arduous process to return the device and wait for a replacement. P.S. all YouTube fixes did not work.,1
1,Lovett easy-to-use is it a setup.,5
0,Got it last week and can’t connect to phone i have deleted app reinstalled it and still keeps telling me that it’s not connected uggggg,2

1,It works but not sure with sleep tracking and also calories. Calories shows a bit too much .,5
0,"My sister, niece and I all got one. Mine can’t do the voice response and although Strava is preloaded it won’t track from the watch. It just displays past runs. I’ve never been so disappointed with an item. I had a perfectly working charge 2. This is no upgrade. The FITBIT customer service says that it just doesn’t work with iPhone. I want to return this piece of 💩",2
1,I am obsessed with this fitness tracker. Love checking my sleep and the amount of steps I take a day.,5
1,One of the best things I could have bought for myself.,5
1,Love this device! I have found it to be very accurate and the data actually encourages me to do more.,5
0,The touchscreen freezes and I have to restart my Versa 2 several times throughout the day.,2
1,I got the Bourduex color and its beautiful with the colorful covers. The only thing is the charger for this one is funny. The port comes out the back so it wont lay flat.,5
1,I bought this for my mother for Christmas and she loves it. She is not very tech savvy but has no issues using it. She loves that it automatically tracks her walks and sleep.,5
1,"The product was just as described. Fast shipping, well protected.",5
1,Love it. Let’s me know information all at once,5
1,I can’t rate the different specifics. Got it for an employee who retired. She loves it!,5
1,Love it! Wanted something more simple than an Apple Watch. Pretty good for tracking exercise!,5
0,Both broke after six months. The one would not pair with my Apple phone. Customer service was terrible!,1
1,I really like the ap that works with it. Only thing that would improve it is built in gps for times I don't want my phone on me.,4
1,My favorite feature for the Fitbit Versa 2 is Alexa Built-In. It is so convenient to set schedules and check notification.,4
1,"This Versa 2 is now my watch, step tracker, exercise monitor, health checker, weather checker and phone message gate keeper. Comfortable and attractive. Long battery charge. Bright and easy to read. Fun watch faces. LOVE it!",5
0,"If I could give it no stars, I would. This thing will not hold a charge and I’m sending it back.",1
1,Please note this was a gift I gave my wife. She loves it and based on her comments I gave it all 5 stars. I am personally an Apple Watch person.,5
1,It was a Christmas surprise for my husband and he loves it.,4
1,I bought this for my wife and she absolutely loves it. She has had other Fitbits and other brand trackers before but would never wear them. She wears this one every day.,5
1,I use this device to track my miles walked. It works well,5
0,"I bought this for husband for his birthday, it won't stay charged for only 2 days and it keeps going off showing only fitbit logo ,keep pressing button finally clock face appears, constantly doing this. I own a fitbit and have no issues , this one sucks.",1
1,"I love this fitbit. I love that I can see my messages, reply to them, track everything, and still be fashionable at the same time.",5
1,Routinely disconnects from my phone. The app is not great and has ruined the experience of this watch for me,3
1,So far sooo good! Will update review after I have used for a bit! Loving the workweek hustle challenge with my coworkers!,4
1,Bought for my wife. She has had 2 other fitbits. She likes this one the best by far.,5
1,"I enjoy my versa 2. So far the only issue I have is it has trouble syncing at times with my phone. I also wish I could use spotify on it without having to have my phone around. Other than that, it works well and battery life is great! I will say the best features is the sleep tracking and the battery life.",4
1,I love my watch!!!!! It is exactly what I wanted! Step counter is amazing along with the heart rate it is all around amazing!,5
0,Stop working. I am very disappointed.,1
1,"For the price it's a solid smart watch. You can find better watches for more, but this is great. I use it to listen to music as I exercise, and I can easily reply to test through voice command.",4
0,I have had Fitbit for years. This is the worst battery life I've ever experienced,2
0,Stopped working after about 3 monthsSays 100% charged when attached to the charger but when taken off it won’t turn onBefore that it was great,2
1,I love it!!! No issues so far. I haven't really played with it yet. I just wear it to track my steps and heart rate.,5
0,Only lasted 3 months. Now cant get replacement from Amazon or get ahold of Fitbit. Apparently they are closed until COVID passes.,1
1,Loving my new Fitbit Versa 2. I purchased the Versa as an upgrade from the Fitbit Charge 2 that stopped working after 6 months. Crossing my fingers.,5
1,"Exceeded my expectations. We had an earlier, smaller, FitBit but it was hard to read. The numbers for the time are large and bright and the resolution for the smaller text is clearer.",5
1,I upgraded my Alta to the Versa 2 and I have been very happy with my upgrade.,5
1,"It “works” but not that wellStep tracking isn’t that accurate, I can shake my wrist and rack up 20+ “steps”. Caught it once monitoring my bpm at 111 as I was sitting at desk. I have to sync it over 5 times in the morning to get it update.Does track my workouts well though",3
1,It was a birthday gift for my wife and she loves it,5
1,I had a Fitbit Charge2 for years and got this Versa2 for my birthday this year. It fits so smoothly and I really like the bigger screen.,5

1,Really like the step and calorie tracking,5
0,The watch just stopped working for no reason. Very disappointed.,1
1,Heart rate worked good for about a month. Now it’s completely inaccurate.,3
1,I love everything about my watch except the piece that holds do the excess band came off and I can't find it.,5
0,"While the device and app are OK, a major issue is that the band keeps popping off. I've reattached it numerous times and now it will not go on again. It is useless. This is the 2nd Fitbit device I've had with the same issue. Not paying for anymore Fitbits. Try Garmin or Apple.",1
0,"I have been really happy with the features of this Fit Bit, however really disappointed that in less than a year the backing or glue gave way that holds the face of the watch in place. Even though it is waterproof, I never tested this yet a woke up with the face hanging off!",2
1,"It works, but the features are just not what I expected for the price",3
1,Ok but already having issues with the garage heart rate monitor less than a year after purchase,4
1,It is a great product. I use it everyday and have never had a problem with it.,5
1,I love it. I finally found a watch I can wear. FashionableCompatible with both my phone & tablet,5
0,"I purchased this watch on Amazon, waited for a friend to bring it for me. When I received it worked fine as it was charged. When I set it to charge i realized it’s defective. It doesn’t charge at all. I even tried with my daughters charger. Nothing. Waste of money",1
1,Love my Fitbit versa 2! I transitioned from the Fitbit blaze and am so thankful I did. The battery lasts for a whole week! It’s comfortable to wear and it’s easy to use. With the nice watch band options I can dress it up for work and switch them out with rubber ones for the gym easily!,5
1,Love the Versa 2 and all its functions. Prefer this over the others.,5
0,I Purchased the Fitbit Versa 2 on May 18 of 2020. September 12 it started to work intermittently. By September 14 the watch would not come on. This watch was for medical purposes. Their policy is they will not do anything until you ship it back and they verify it is in their warehouse. Online chat with Kevin From FitbitChat was of no value.,2
1,"This watch is great. The battery life is amazing. If you turn on the always on display, the battery drains quickly.",5
1,It is a nice watch. The heart rate did not work when I got it. I have contacted Fitbit and they are replacing it. Customer service was easy to work with.What concerns me now is that I forgot to wear my fitbit yesterday and it still recorded steps and Other STATS for me. How did THAT happen?! I am still going to give the new Fitbit a chance when I get it but I am skeptical to say the least.,3
0,"Darn it, I checked too late. I thought I had another two weeks to return the item. This Fit bit Versa 2 has been glitching ever since I purchased. As a reminder, set a date on your calendar so you know when you need to return faulty items purchased on line.",2
1,"The battery lasts a few days, and tracks sleep and steps well. I haven't uploaded music yet so that might drain the battery faster while listening.",5
0,"Never got to use the product: tried to swap to the larger size band and due to the design—apparently never tested by the manufacturer, I could not get the clips in. Instructions were inadequate, and even after watching a video on how to do this tricky thing, still no luck. I don't understand why product designers seemingly choose the difficult over the tried and true. I am very disappointed.",1
0,"I bought one in May last year, it just stopped working, they said that for repairs it's cheaper to buy a new one. I never threw my money away again. I'll never want a watch from that brand again. The watch can be disposable, my money No!",1
1,I am into all the Fitbit app features. The versa 2 was a good priced high quality fitness tracker.,5
1,"So glad I bought this, I love it! Sometimes it does not sync and you need to turn off and on bluetooth. Not a big deal though",5
1,"Like the watch, last watch battery didn't last. Giving this another try.",5
0,Strap was supposed to be a special edition woven strap and the original strap in navy blue. Instead this awful green strap arrives with no woven extra strap and a damaged box.,1
0,"After having it for less than one month, it stopped working correctly. It constantly freezes and just stays black.",1
1,Easy yo read but a challenge to set up,5
1,My first Fitbit Versa was great and died 4 months in (and I was still paying for it!). No amount of restarting would fix it. This Versa 2 is fantassssstic. Super accurate. My favorite feature is the sleep tracking as it was with the original Fitbit Versa. Still learning about all the cool new features but it's been a great purchase so far.,5
1,So happy I upgraded to the Versa 2 from the Flex. I love having access to my daily activities right on my wrist. Having the Versa 2 keeps me motivated to workout and the reminder tells me when I am sitting at my desk too long. Best purchase yet.,5
0,"... and then I charged it overnight after wearing it down to 35% battery. Next morning, it would not wake up/open/boot up. Black face. No reset 8 seconds, no start up, nothing. Very disappointed with this watch and will appeal to the manufacturer.",1
1,received watch in good condition but only received one side of the spare watch band. the side with the buckle was missing. Please send the other side of the watch band.,3
0,So bummed. Was excited to get this. It would not work with my Samsung Galaxy 8. Kept saying Fitbit is down for maintenance and wouldn't connect to my wifi. Returned it for refund.,1
1,This is my third Fitbit. I've upgraded and given my other ones to family.,5
1,This was a present for my husband who is a disabled vet. He LOVES IT he loves seeing how many steps he takes a day and also his heart rate. Thank you for putting a smile on my husbands face. This was his 85th birthday present,5
1,"I. Wear it for the time, and to track my heart rate.",5
1,The only downside is that i got a bit of a rash when i wore it to bed on a hotter night and got a bit sweaty under the watch. After not wearing for a week or so the rash went away and now i wear it on my left wrist during the day and my right wrist at night to avoid getting a rash,5
1,My wife has one and my 8-year old have one.These are great and cheaper than Apple watch.,5
1,"My wife loves the functions, fit, ease of use and look. She has stated she will by again if needed.",5
1,First one wouldn't hold charge for an hour. Replacement was fairly easy but very slow arriving. Works fine; charge lasts 5 days +.,3
0,I received this on December 22 - I wear it everyday and night- today is February 13 and it no longer works- just went black 2 days ago and won’t turn on or charge. Very disappointed. W,1
1,I bought this item fairly quickly and without a lot of research. it was recommended in an article. It was delivered very quickly and I could not be more satisfied. It is super user-friendly. Easy to use. Any app is available. It does so much more than just tracking exercise and fitness. Very pleased,5
1,Had to replace my Fitbit Versa and ordered the Fitbit Versa 2. This watch is amazing and the apps that is has now are awesome. The band is so soft on my skin and doesn't rub like the other bands did. Great product great price!!!,5
0,Started spontaneously shutting down after 3 months. Bought it 8 months ago died today. Not abused. Used for jogging and walk,1
1,This is convenient and comfortable,5
1,"Lots of information on watch and app. Difficulty getting wallet to work, otherwise works great.",5
0,Mine was not good.. not accurate when walking .. the bpm not accurate.. if you like a watch to tell time that about all it’s good for... I did like the that the message came up quickklyy.,2
1,Love the waterproof feature! The device keeps.me on my toes concerning my movement and stops me from being lazy.,5
0,Lasted 3 months then stopped working. Factory reset and restarted. Nothing worked. Returned.,1
0,I can't rate the device itself. I did not even start to use it. The band is held on by a small pin that bent. I am really sick of Fitbit making devices with crappy bands. I have had to replace my Charge 2 band twice (one covered by warranty). Please make a better band for your products especially since these things are designed to be worn during exercise. I shouldn't have to worry about the band breaking.,1
1,Needs recharging every day.Like the look and some of its functions,3
1,Very nice,5
1,"The Versa 2 is far better than my Apple Watch! It does everything my Apple Watch did except “ping” iPhone when can’t find! Only, this is half the price, 5 day battery life, sleep tracking, 24/7 heart rate monitor at your finger tips and is more comfortable to wear than the Apple Watch! 10/10 would recommend!!",5
1,Love this watch. I waited way too long in getting one. Must buy.,5
1,"Love mine, it tracks my weight lose, exercise ,and so so so much more.",5
1,5 days in very pleased so far.,4
0,"Worked great for the first 2 weeks, then started to use the battery at an accelerating rate...almost 70% per day (up from about 15%). Also refused to sync with app. Reloaded app, to no avail. Returned it!",2
1,Never stays connected to alexa...never connects to blue tooth. Counts steps when idle..have to pay for extra services. I hate it,5
1,"I love my FitBit. This is my second FitBit, I wanted to upgrade to this, and I love it so much. Works well, fast, and accurate.",5
0,Love this Fitbit but my Alexa app does not work. Too late for me to return and I've tried all the steps for help.,2
1,I like all the displays. Colorful and easy to use.,5
1,"I have used a Fitbit for 7 years, trying a number of different models, including the Charge, Charge 2, Blaze, and Ionic. I really am enjoying this one, and especially appreciate the longer battery life.",5
0,"I have had this for 9 months now, and the face just came off. I tried pushing it back in and it will not stay. Weird. because I didn't know that it will only last nine months. What I don't understand is why it will last just a short period of time. Disappointed.",1
1,"Everything has been great, the only negative is that the band broke my wrist out and now it is discolored. I switched it to my opposite arm trying to allow the redness to fade only to see that now it is brown and leathery like a burn healing. Will have to try and find another watch band.",4
1,"It was great, I just wanted something a little more functional. It is in my opinion for the money its well worth it.",5
1,"The watch itself is great, but you have to buy a subscription to fitbit premium in order to receive notifications at all, or even display weather info on the main watch face.",3
0,Overall not impressed with the watch. The steps are not accurate at all. No answering calls from watch etc.. have to charge it every 2 days. I would rather have a nice old watch,2
1,,5
0,"This watch worked fine for first few months, now sometimes when I try to change screens or shut off alarms or reminders it doesn't respond. I'll be checking my warranty to see if I can get full refund and replace with Samsung watch. Very disappointed in this product.",1
1,Love it! But... screen should be more sensitive and I can’t add friends at all!,5
1,Love it!,5
1,"Love how it keeps up with sleep, weight, and steps",5
1,"Convenient, capable of adding apps. Had some difficulty syncing but once everything worked out I love it!!",5
0,It cracked in the 1st month and they won't replace the screen. The company said I need to buy a new $200+ watch. Really?,1
0,This is the worst item I have ever purchased through Amazon once you get the band off you can’t get it back on which will create a problem since you must remove the band in order to charge the device whoever came up with this idea needs to go back to the drawing board sadly this item will be going back so much for my birthday present thank you Fitbit,1
1,"For the price it is a great watch, but with 8 moths in used the screen fell off the body of the watch.",4
0,Watch wouldn't charge nor turn on. I guess the QC the products before they leave the warehouse.,1
1,The fitbit versa is awesome,5
1,"The media could not be loaded.

1,Some one will love this at Xmas Time!!,5
1,Love the smartwatch!,4
1,"Perfect image, perfect pairing with device, sleep tracking is very accurate. The app itself has really neat features like workouts and meditation",5
1,Gave to my daughter as a Christmas gift . She loves the variety of pic with her watch. Very pretty watch.,5
1,Just great. I like how I only have to chat de once a week. I use the sleep tracker and the workout tracker.,5
0,Was charged for a new one and when it was delivered the box was opened was opened and there was no screen cover and the charger was just shoved in the box! Very unhappy!,1
1,Average product for the price. You have to upgrade your Spotify and pandora subscriptions just to listen to music on the watch. The step tracker is also wildly inaccurate. My steps continually went up while I sat for hours at a time. It’s essentially a fancy heart rate monitor,3
0,"The first one lasted 7 months. The replacement lasted 5. The warranty doesn't extend from the replacement so fitbit won't cover another replacement and I'm SOL. Their solution was to offer me a discount on their watches that didn't last more than 7 months. While it works, it's great. Just don't expect it to last long",1
1,Absolutely love it! I upgraded from a different model. I've had no syncing issues and I love that I can reply to texts without getting my phone out of my pocket!,5
0,Fell apart at the 6 month mark!,2
1,Very happy with this purchase.,5
1,Having some trouble with bluetooth seeming to never stay connected to my phone. Love the battery life.,4
0,A lot of money for something that won’t even last two years,1
1,Best of all the smart watches I've tried out with a good app and excellent display. I use it mostly to count steps and notify messages and phone calls. Very good battery life.,5
1,"I love my Fitbit Versa 2, it keeps me active. It challenges me to keep active, and I can see my messages and see who is calling before answering my phone. Also I love the way it looks on my arm.",5
1,Its perfect and it has ALEXA!!!! I love my watch and was lucky enough to get it at a Great price,5
1,Loved it all. Except the tiny burn mark it leaves where the laser touches the skin. Had to return it.,4
0,"The features come and go, depending on the program updates. Read the compatibility chart before buying.",1
1,I've changed my clock face to a holiday theme and think it drains the battery quite a bit then the normal face. Other then that its perfect!,5
1,But these things have always been just a rental < one year usually,4
1,Happy with my purchase.,5
0,Did not like the style,1
0,The quality is crap they heart rate monitor will stop working right after the warranty period. The heart monitor also is the reason I can track sleep and they won’t do anything about it except give a slight discount on a new product. Do not buy from this company!!!,1
0,"Would not stay connected to the bluetooth on my phone which did not allow the mobile app to keep track of the steps, calories lost, and sleep. I was disappointed with this as I initially loved the watch.",1
1,Love this. I had to send back another brand that I bought. Very pleased with this purchase,5
1,"Great does what it says it does.Only down fall I get a allergic reaction to the band,got that baby smooth sensitive skin ya know! Lol! but no thang ,I bought these like material bands.Problem solved.Maybe for future reference offer at least one of these and the orginal",5
1,"This is my favorite Fitbit I’ve had so far. It’s incredible! I wish I could text on it and push a shopping cart and track my steps at the same time, but it does everything else I need and more. I love that I can swim and shower with it. Plus, the sleep tracking is awesome. Definitely recommend!!",5
1,Not sure this was a gift,4
1,"I had the flex 2 for almost three years, this is a lot more than I and used too. But so far i love it.",5
1,Love my watch. Does everything It says it will do. Very nice watch.,5
1,Really like it so far. Much better than my charge. Alexa integration needs work. Not of much use in its current functionality.,5
1,I've had no problems and it's worked exactly as expected.,5
1,Love this Fitbit - it is the best one that I have,5
1,Great by,5
1,Fitbit versa 2 stop syncing texts and incoming calls for over a month. After several tries to reset it I called Fitbit was informed that engineers are working on it.,3

1,I love it. Best thing I ever purchased.,5
0,Just randomly stopped working today. How do I get a refund?,1
1,"Excelente producto, me llego en en más o menos unas semana a pesar de ser envió al extranjero",5
1,Got this for my wife’s birthday and she wears it daily and enjoys the fact it tells her to get up and move,5
1,Provides great information and keeps me on track with my health goals.,5
0,Everything was great for three days then it just stopped working wouldn’t stay on then wouldn’t turn on at all. For some reason this device had a glitch and to spend this much money on something and not have it work for more than three days is very irritating.,1
1,"Features and functions are just right for my activities of running, weight training, and sleep tracking. Love it!",4
1,La batería ha durado hasta 7 días y el seguimiento de sueño es exacto,4
0,"I really liked my fitbit, but it died after only 6 months. Too expensive for such poor quality/durability.",2
1,I love the verse of two better than the converse the one tracks more accurately has Alexa on it,5
0,I bought this Fitbit at the end of July and it stopped working by the end of October. My window to return it was within one month. These new Fitbits are worthless. I had my first Fitbit Charger for more than 4 years. This $179.00 Fitbit Versa 2 didn't even last 3 months. Very unsatisfied!!!,1
1,The as an older person I wishedThere was a written owners manual. I found it difficult to use.,5
1,Well made product. Would repurchase again. Great seller and product.,5
1,I like that it tracks so many different things!,5
1,"i LOVE my fitbit, it tracks sleep, calories, heart rate, work outs it's awesome",5
0,I heard a lot of good reviews about fit bit watches before I decided to purchase one but very disappointed that it last d only a year to get damage with no fall nor water contact the screen just came off.,1
0,Make sure when you get the watch that it is in English. I receive mine and it was in Spanish or Chinese. I had to return the product and see that I was suppose to get my product today. I don't see it on the website now. This is a major problem to me because of the price of this product.,2
0,Want a piece of junk that breaks? This is my second Fitbit tWheee the face popped off Junk Wish me luck trying to get my refund,1
0,"No se embarquen ! Después de casi 6 meses dejó de funcionar . Te redirigen al foro pero no te dan soluciones sólo un ""vamos a revisar y te avisamos"" como si compras algo pensando que si se daña (no carga , no enciende) vas a esperar cuándo soporte crea que ""ya tienen la solución"" . Cuiden su dinero ya que nadie les va a resolver",1

1,The Fit Bit Versa 2 screen went dead after only 3 months.Fit Bit is sending me a brand new Versa 2 for free.,5
0,"The included silicone band does not fit the FitBit Versa 2 SE. There are many comments on the Fitbit website that complains that the silicone band is a problem. It makes me wonder that if the official band does not fit, would bands from Amazon also not work? The woven band works, but the silicone one doesn’t.",1
1,"Amazing, easy, impressive tracker, long lasting and fits perfectly considering I'm small.",5
1,"The only issues I have with it is, the battery doesn’t last as long so when I charge it I’ll some times forget about it and some steps don’t get recorded.",5

0,"I have had problems with my Versa 2 since the very first update ( 30 days after I got it) It vibrates all during the day, often it won't allow me to scroll, and I have to charge it about every 2 days. I believe it may be defective. Any suggestions??",2
1,Seems to work pretty dang good. However there needs to be higher level integration of the workouts available for the app and the watch. It’s silly with as many as you sell for me to need to pay for quality apps to integrate well.,4
1,Love this watch. I wear it every day. The Alexa part is a little iffy but it was totally worth the money I spent.,5
1,Especially like the sleep trackingThe only dislike is that the longer wrist band was very difficult to get on the watch,4
0,"Keeps stopping the notifications, I have to reset it so many times is ridicules, I have a cheaper fit and works better so aggravated I want to return this item how do I go about. I been dealing with this issue for the past months I gave it a chance still not working",2
1,So happy I upgraded to the Versa 2. I have the Alta prior and this watch was a huge upgade.,5
1,"Love it, looks like an Apple Watch for half the cost. I don’t need it to answer calls but it alerts me when a call or text message comes in. Wanted it for fitness and that’s what it’s great at!",5
0,The pulse monitor is inaccurate.Researched and is major problem with other customers. Do not buy until they solve this issue.,1
1,A lot more accurate than my Blaze. And syncs with no problems. Love the add on apps,5
1,Love this watch. Love that it can go in water and has a slick smooth design.,5
1,"Excellent tracker, but better for tracking trends than exact calories. Most of the time, it massively overestimates my daily caloric output.",5
1,"I love the Fitbit Versa 2. I just need to get headphones to listen to my music, but I am really looking forward to hearing the music I was able to download.",5
1,I love the fact that this watch has an excellent battery life. I bought it to replace an off brand smart watch that didn't sync with my Android phone very well. I also like the health tracking features.,5
1,Been a Fitbit wearer since the Charge HR came out. I love my new upgrade. So far so good..,5
1,Love that it keep track of everything and it fits great,5
1,I didn’t realize that it also alerts you when you get a phone call and you can receive your text messages on it.,5
1,It's so easy to use,5
1,"Not bad, but app does not work all the time. Does not work well with Alexa, Bluetooth or wi fi",4
0,Wouldn’t link up,1
1,This the best smart fitness watch at a reasonable cost for consumers compared to the Apple Watch.,5
1,nothing,5
1,I love this Fitbit! I also bought one for my daughter and father in law!,5
1,"I love the sleep app, as well as the reminders and alarms. I'm disappointed with battery life, but it could be that I'm just not used to needing to charge it.",5
1,Love this product!!!!,5
0,Had this since December and the display stopped working??,1
1,Great watch/tracker. My only problem is the Bluetooth connection which controls music (Classic) is unstable with my Note 10.,4
0,"Gave me a bad skin rash, worse than the band on the original Versa. I took it off frequently and gave my wrist a break often, kept the watch and bands and my skin clean and still got a bad rash.In all honesty, the versa 2 doesn’t seem that different than the first one. My first one does all the same things I wanted versa 2 for once it updated.",1
1,"I like it a lot but none of my fitbits i,,'ve had encluding this one will work for GPS off my phone to track bike riding. Outside of that I like it alot",4
1,Love it! Bought one for my husband. Going to buy one for me !,5
1,It’s almost same Fitbit versa they just added Alexa which I don’t use,3
0,There's something wrong with my Versa 2 as my battery only lasts about 2 days. In so frustrated!,1
1,"This is the total package, what an amazing Product !",5
0,Save your money. Don’t by totally died after two weeks,1
1,Works great. No complaints.,5
1,"So far so good, I had a fitbit blaze that I loved this is an absolute amazing smartwatch",5
0,"This is my third Fitbit watch. I am a big fan. The Versa 2 Special Edition seems to not be as well constructed as the last 2 I bought. The screen popped off and I cannot get it to stay on. Tried reaching out to Fitbit directly. So far, they haven't been helpful.",1
1,Absolutely love my new fitbit! There are a lot of available features and I love being able to change the faces.,5
1,I love that when I’m outside I can actually see the time. Other fitbits I’ve had didn’t do this. Comfortable and works well no cheating on those steps as with other fit bits.,5
1,"Use this product to measure my steps. Always great to hit 10,000 steps in a day’",5
1,Easy to install and use. Does make me more aware of how much activity I have during a day.,5
1,My wife really likes this Versa 2. That says a whole lot!,5
1,Love it but wish I could connect with all my friends on my old Versa can’t figure it out 😩,5
1,I like all its features. Best of All Alexa.,5
0,This never fully charged straight out of the box. I have tried multiple times to get it to charge to 100% to no avail. What little charge it has will not hold more than 3 hours. Requested refund. Totally unhappy with purchase.,1
0,I've had this about a year and a half and it's dead,2
1,I haven't had it a year and it won't hold a charge... it works great when it is charged but for it to quit before even a year old is not worth the money.,3
1,Best Fitbit I've had so far. Long lasting battery life. Accurate information displayed,5
0,Bought it because it said it could track my sleep. It doesn't. Most days says zero. Also tracking of steps is not accurate as any arm movement counts as a step. Way off. Disappointed,2
1,I liked everything about it and very nice looking as well,5
1,"Use this for so much! Tracks sleep, heart rate, steps, everything! Love this watch!!",5
1,Does a great job of monitoring sleep but I have had problems with it monitoring my exercise - particularly cycling.,4
1,"wear every day since i receive it, screen, build, design is great except the strap where it easily stick with dust. Replace with the nylon strap. the features i need is basic and i don't connect it to my phone (except to sync my sleeping record in the morning). battery lasts for 5-6 days",5
1,Husband bought it for me and I love it!,5
0,I have bought 6 or 7 Fit Bit watches and 5 of them for my girlfrend.Be forewarned if you buy a fitbit is will break for sure. They are great but they will not last long. Buy something else,1
1,Currently keenly interested in blood oxygen level indicator in the sleep metrics.,5
0,Nice watch for sons bday gift. Ordered June 1. However the electronic components died in 5 months - it no longer functions at all. Unfortunately product support window closed Dec 5.,2
1,I like everything about this watch ! I love knowing how much I walk/run every day!,5
0,The watch works well to track HR and sleep. I was happy with it until month 10. When I took a shower with it got moisture in it now it doesnt work.....,1
1,Band broke after only 3 months. Sooo disappointed. My Fitbit charge 3 lasted for 3 years and was half the cost. Wish I could exchange but my return window has past,3
0,I have had this watch for several months and it's been the worst Fitbit that I've owned. It's always had some issues with HR accuracy but the last few months it has become progressively worse. I won't buy another Fitbit.,1
0,"I would not get this again, you can not easily switch out bands because of how the bands are made. I have watched numerous YouTube videos on how to switch out bands, maybe my holes are too small, I don’t know but I regret not getting an Apple Watch",2
1,This was a replacement for the previous device which died. Both have been just fine.,5
0,i sent this product back already,1
1,I had it since two years ago and it's such an amazing product and I am so thankful because it helps me with my diet and in my sports exercises also it's become a basic thing for me,5
0,"I’ve only had the watch for 2 weeks. The watch is slow 5 minutes, and I traveled to the east coast and the watch would not update with the current time.",2
1,I love the look and feel and tracking capabilities I ordered a dressier watch band so I can wear it everywhere.,5
1,"Bought as a gift, and my wife loves it! She wanted a smart watch for messaging and fitness tracking, also being able to use it during the day and track sleep that night (without always being on the charger). Was easy to set up and sync with Samsung phone, battery life is great!",5
0,"I loved the watch, but today the face was hanging off and when i tried putting it back in place, the screen is just white and clear??",2
1,Works as expected,5
1,Bought this for my wife and she loves it!,5
1,I am in love with this watch and all the different things it has on it.,5
1,"Great watch that works well! It's definitely a fitness tracker that looks like a watch not a full smart watch, but you get the style, looks, and display without the gps, full functionality, and associated costs.",5
1,"Love love love it! Easy to use, easy to read, light weight and no bottom bump like on my charge 2!",5
1,"I absolutely love this Fitbit, upgraded from the much smaller version. Has everything I need and more",5
1,"This is my 3rd fitbit, and still love them. Remember to buy a protector for the screen, it does scratch up with everyday life. Besides that great",5
0,Useless piece of junk that has most apps paywalled. Can't even change the time by itself without the app. Which doesn't even sync properly.,1
1,"Was a little skeptical whether this would be worth the money or not , but , it has surpassed all of my expectations! I even ordered a 2nd one because my husband ended up liking mine far better than the Samsung watches.",5
1,Use it for steps for tracking.,5
1,I have had an old one fir years. Finally stopped working I luff this one,5
1,Much more detailed than my charge 2,5
1,I love this product! I upgraded from a FitBit Alta and I'm just in love with this product. I get so many compliments on it!,5
1,"I like my Fitbit Versa. The tracking features are really nice and I love my emoji that reminds me of all of my daily activities. Just wish the battery life lasted a bit longer before having to recharge. Overall, it's a keeper.",5
1,"I've only had it for 3 days, but so far I have to restart my phone every day in order to receive notifications on the watch. So I've missed the early morning notifications before I noticed there's a problem.Sleep tracking seems pretty accurate.I haven't used it enough to offer a realistic opinion of the battery life. We'll see how it goes.",3
0,This product is only good for tracking sleep or steps. Product does not work when you’re working out. I will be in a full sprint and my watch will say i have a heart beat of 55. Would not recommend for people looking to track high intensity work outs.,1
1,"Es muy complicado para poner wifi,quizas necesito ayuda",3
1,"Wonderful tool to track steps and heart rate. Fitbit replaced my Versa 2 when broke. Order a case for the face to protect it, very reasonable and another way to add pizzazz.",5
1,"Got this for my wife and her only complaint is unlike and apple watch or galaxy gear you have to use the app to make changes to the watch instead of being able to do it right from your wrist. I think this is outweighed by the ridiculous battery life, without always on screen it has lasted 5 days without needing to be charged.",4
1,"love this so far, have not got to use the text on the phone. I have to figure out the iPhone vs the fitbit",5
1,Don't use sleep tracker,5
1,I purchased 2 of these for my wife and I. We both use all the features to track our health. Wish the premium features were free as we already spent the money for the tech.,5
1,Nice and easy to use; Pretty accurate and dependable. Battery life is better than expected. Great support from Fitbit community!,4
1,Very nice watch. Of course it’s no Apple Watch but it does a lot and the price is great! I wear mine everyday,5
0,Heart Rate is inaccurate most of the time. Especially during physical activities. Don’t buy this if that is one of the features you need to function.,2
1,its agood watch,5
0,Very unhappy with my Versa smart watch. Battery not holding a charge. Advertised as holding a charge for 4 days. I barely get one day.,2
0,This Versa failed in 5 days,1
1,Glass sucks,3
1,"Works great, decent battery life, and I like all the different faces you can choose from. The band is comfortable, and the overall weight and size are excellent.",5
0,Worked for a couple months and then stopped. Tried resetting it and nothing,1
0,This is the worst purchase I have ever made. It is lying in a drawer unused. It will not register steps without wifi. It has no function except for indoors. Never would purchase. Mfg will not refund my $,1
1,My wife loves this it motivates her to walk more she feels great when she accomplishes her goals,5
1,I love this Fitbit. I wish I could play Amazon music. No problems.,5
0,"Product Quality has gone downhill. I have owned Fitbit watches foe nearly a decade. The last 2 verse watches have had multiple problems. This last one, didn’t even last a year before the screen just popped off today! ?? What the heck? Bought less than 1 year ago.",1
1,"Easy to use, so many things to okay with on the apps! Love this version,",5
1,I have been wanting this for some time and am very happy with it. The battery life is great also!,5
0,Just received this today and it won’t even charge or turn on,1
1,"I like the heart rate monitoring on this watch and it is very light. However, one big issue it has is that the integration with Strava is limited to only when GPS is enabled, basically for a RUN. The exercise metrics for all the remaining workouts CANNOT be shared on Strava. Which is pretty absurd.",4
1,So far great!! Only upgraded because my Fitbit Versa screen stopped working. Hopefully this one is just as perfect as my versa was.,5
1,"The dog ate the literature that came with Fitbit,so I can only figure it out by playing with it. Not sure if I know all that it can do.",5
1,"My doctor wants me to keep an eye on my heart and walk every 5 days for 20 minutes or more. This makes it much easier to keep up with. Besides that, it is cute and easy to see.",5
1,Love my Fitbit! It’s made me move more. I didn’t realize how quick an hour could go by that i dont get enough steps in! Think its great that it reminds and encourages me!,5
1,I love this Fitbit. It is great for tracking health and sleep.,5
0,Never got toHookIt up . Instructions are not clear it was Waste of money,1
1,Sometimes calls and texts fail to come thru,5
0,"Really love fitbit, but this one just suddenly stopped working. The screen is just in a constant state of blur/fuzzy/colored lines. No idea what happened.",1
